    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 92 together.</p><p>The Government recognises the important role that family carers play in Irish society and is fully committed to their support through a range of supports and services. </p><p>The main income supports to carers provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant. Spending on these payments in 2022 is expected to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p><p>The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. </p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the carer means test which will take effect in June:  </p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner,</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p><p>Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p><p>Notwithstanding the increased level of support already in place for carers, my Department will keep these measures under review as part of the annual budgetary process.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA00900"><p>As I have already emphasised, the Government is fully supportive of the important role that family carers play in Irish society and is fully committed to their support through a range of supports and services.  My Department provides a range of income supports to family carers including Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant. </p><p>There are currently 90,896 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  This represents an increase of 74% in the past 10 years, from 52,209 in 2012.  The average time to award the Alllowance was 4 weeks in 2021, as compared to 14 weeks in 2019.  My department understands the many pressures faced by carers and always seeks to ensure that claims are handled quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Decisions regarding the means test are taken in a budgetary context and are therefore subject to discussions with other relevant departments in the usual way. </p><p>I have made sure to speak to carer representatives myself to understand their concerns, and my Department engages with carer groups regularly.  This level of engagement has helped inform some considerable improvements that have been introduced for carers in recent years, including:</p><p>- In Budget 2020, the number of hours a carer could engage in education, training or employment was increased from 15 to 18.5 hours.</p><p>- In Budget 2021, the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant was increased by &euro;150 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850 per year.</p><p>The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  </p><p>From June, as a result of the measures I announced in Budget 2022, the following improvements will be made to the carer means test:</p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA01300"><p>My Department is committed to providing high quality services to help people who are long term unemployed prepare for and secure employment.  It does this through a combination of directly provided services and contracted services.  Under national and EU procurement rules, and as advised by the Attorney General and the Chief States Solicitor's Office, contracted services must be procured via open and competitive procurement. </p><p>My Department is therefore procuring a new Local Area Employment Service over two distinct phases.  Phase one of the process for procuring new employment services involved seven counties in the Midlands and North West who did not have a Local Employment Service.  Contracts were signed last December and services are in the process of being mobilised.</p><p>Phase two of the process has now commenced, with the publication of the request for tender in December for seventeen lots covering 19 counties.  Services for this phase will begin in July 2022.</p><p>While I am aware of the media reports the Deputy is referring to, I obviously cannot comment on potential bids to what is a live procurement process. </p><p>I can however say that, as with every open competitive procurement, it is open to any entity to submit a tender.  Of course any tender submitted must meet certain qualifying criteria laid out in the tender documents.  Provided it does so it will then be considered on its own merits, in line with procurement law.  This does not mean that the tender submitted must succeed but it does mean that it has the opportunity to be considered.  This is how legal procurement works.</p><p>I would emphasise that under the procurement process for Local Area Employment Services now underway, 80% of the award criteria marks are related to the quality of the service, its community linkages, and its impact on social value.  The experience from Phase 1 shows that community and voluntary groups can and did succeed, securing contracts in two of the three lots where they submitted a tender.  I am therefore confident that community and voluntary based providers who work collaboratively and submit high quality bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract.  <b></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA01600"><p>The Treatment Benefit schemes, which include dental, optical and hearing services are available to insured workers, the self-employed and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions.  These treatments are also available to their dependent spouse or partner if applicable.&euro;109 million was spent on the scheme in 2021.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I announced an expansion to the range of services available under the scheme. A new grant will be provided from 28 May 2022 towards the cost of wigs and hairpieces for people who suffer from hair loss due to disease.</p><p>A grant of up to &euro;500 will be available once every calendar year to support people towards the cost of non-surgical hair replacement.  This amount can be added to by the person if they wish to purchase a more expensive product. </p><p>Hair loss is a common issue among people that can be caused by a variety of medical conditions including autoimmune diseases such as alopecia or systemic conditions like cancer.  I recognise not only the physical impact, but also the psychological impact, that sudden hair loss can have on a person&rsquo;s life.  I hope that this new grant will contribute to improving the quality of life of those who need it.  It will only be available for hair loss in respect of a disease and not due to ageing or other natural causes. </p><p>Approximately 2.25 million people qualify for Treatment Benefit.  It is difficult to estimate the level of take-up of this new benefit.  For example, 25,000 people get diagnosed with invasive cancer annually and it is anticipated that up to 2,000 of them may apply for the grant.  The estimated cost of the new grant is &euro;1 million per year. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department is responsible for ensuring good governance of employment service provision, which requires greater oversight and enhanced visibility of service provision.</p><p>I can say that, as with every open competitive procurement, it is open to any entity to submit a tender.  Of course any tender submitted must meet certain qualifying criteria laid out in the tender documents.  Provided it does so it will then be considered on its own merits, in line with procurement law.  This is how legal procurement works.  </p><p>I would emphasise that under the procurement process for Local Area Employment Services now underway, 80% of the award criteria marks are related to the quality of the service, its community linkages, and its impact on social value.</p><p>The experience from Phase 1 shows that community and voluntary groups can and did succeed.  I am therefore confident that community and voluntary based providers who work collaboratively and submit high quality bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract.  The publicity relating to the possibility of new market entrants shouldn't distract from the ability of existing service providers to submit high-quality bids for the new service, particularly as my Department has worked hard to take on board feedback from phase 1 of the process.  As part of this feedback process, and prior to issuing the request for tender, the Department met with existing service providers and representative bodies and also took a number of brief introductory video call with interested parties at their request.  The purpose of these was to outline the proposed tender process and timelines.</p><p>I am sure that the quality-first approach which is now part of the phase 2 tender will ensure that, as we expand employment services throughout the State, we retain a focus on providing the best possible service to the long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

The research has implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports. </p><p>In order to implement an all-Department response, the Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte. </p><p>This Group has oversight of monitoring the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and it is in this regard that the Government saw it fitting that this group would be the appropriate monitoring vehicle.  </p><p>It will consider and monitor actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of this report on a bi-annual basis. </p><p>All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implemented and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report.</p><p>From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers, which will go towards alleviating the financial costs experienced.  These include a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards as well as supports to employers. </p><p>Furthermore, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  I have asked my officials to revisit the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal to take on board the findings in the Cost of Disability research.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The outcome of this open and transparent procurement process was not contested by any party.  </p><p>I understand that all former Job Club staff in Laois/Offaly were offered employment on their existing terms and conditions by the new service provider, I also understand that early last month the staff commenced training with the successful new provider.  Accordingly, no person has lost employment or has seen any reduction in their terms and conditions.</p><p>I am not aware of any Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) recommendation on this matter.  However, on 15 December 2021, the WRC did write to my Department regarding ongoing work stoppages in Job Clubs in Offaly and Laois.  I understand that these stoppages related to the protests regarding the procurement process generally and that no formal dispute has been registered with the new service provider.</p><p>My Department is not the employer of any of its service partners' staff.  Neither is it a party to an industrial dispute with any of its service partners or their employees.  It would therefore be inappropriate for the Department to engage in discussions at the WRC, which is a forum to resolve disputes between an employer and their employees.  However, the Department has advised the WRC that it is available to provide any information or clarification directly to the WRC if required.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the Help to Buy scheme itself would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question as to whether my Department will consider the introduction of a new scheme, similar to the HTB scheme, to assist first-time buyers of homes that are not new builds, it would be usual that proposals for tax expenditure measures would be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.   </p>  <p>  A scheme along the lines proposed by the Deputy would provide no incentive effect for encouraging the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile the policy objective, lead to a narrowing of the tax base and a strong and convincing case for the benefits and outcomes need to be articulated in order for due consideration to be given for the commitment of scarce taxpayer resources for such reliefs.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may know, in my Budget 2022 address, in addition to announcing an extension of HTB for a further year, I also undertook that a formal review of the scheme would take place in 2022. The intention is that the review will be fundamental in nature, and that it will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022.</p></reply>

In particular, under Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code, a regulated firm that intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated firm, must:</p>  <p>  - provide affected consumers with at least two months&rsquo; notice to enable them to make alternative arrangements if they so wish; </p>  <p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to any transfer, merger or cessation of operations; or, in the case of a transfer or merger, inform customers as to how continuity of service will be provided following a transfer or merger; and</p>  <p>  - in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform customers that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, on 25 June 2021, the Central Bank issued an industry letter regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. These expectations reflect its assessment of possible risks to consumers during periods of change and reinforce previously communicated expectations, based on its experience of prior events. The Central Bank expects that, by clearly outlining its expectations, this will inform regulated entities&rsquo; actions and decisions to ensure that customers&rsquo; interests are protected and potential risks are mitigated.</p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in Annex III of the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate from VAT.  Within its rates structure, the EU VAT Directive also allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III. Currently Ireland has a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.  Ireland also holds a number of derogations, under which is it permitted to retain some historic VAT arrangements, under strict conditions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is enquiring about the VAT rates applicable to certain categories of goods: food, fuel and fertiliser.</p>  <p>  Under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to continue to apply zero or very low rates of VAT where they already had these in place at 1 January 1991.  On this basis, Ireland continues to apply a zero rate of VAT to basic food products, but is not permitted to extend the scope of this derogation.  Other food items are subject to either the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% or the standard rate of 23%.</p>  <p>  Under another derogation, Ireland has retained its historic application of one of the reduced rates of VAT, 13.5%, to the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use and under the Directive the rate applicable to such services cannot be reduced below 12%.</p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the supply of motor fuel, specifically petrol and diesel, is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. There is no discretion under the Directive for Ireland to remove these supplies from the standard rate.</p>  <p>  As a further derogation related to historic arrangements, Ireland applies the zero rate of VAT to fertiliser, provided such fertiliser is supplied in units of not less than 10 kilos; otherwise, the standard rate of VAT applies.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that VAT returns do not require traders to separately identify the VAT amount associated with their supply of specific products or services. Therefore, the information required to estimate the cost that would be associated with reducing the VAT rate on specific items (even were this legally possible) is not readily available. </p>  <p>  Future tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget. Deputies will be aware that my officials prepare a series of papers containing tax options for the Tax Strategy Group to be considered in the context of the budgetary process, alongside a wide range of submissions from various stakeholders and lobby groups.</p></reply>

The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be overstated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. </p>  <p>  The intention of the Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme is to research the impact a basic income grant scheme would have on artists and creatives work patterns by providing the opportunity to focus on their practice, and to minimise the loss of skills from the arts as a result of the pandemic and to contribute to the sectors gradual regrowth post pandemic. </p>  <p>  Like all income the grant payment will be reckonable for both income tax and social welfare means test purposes.  However, the level of tax paid and/or the impact on a social welfare payment will depend on each person's individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The means testing of social welfare payments is a statutory function of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD and I have no statutory role in that regard. Engagement on the pilot scheme has been ongoing between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Basic Income for the Arts scheme is not a social welfare payment, it is a grant payment and is a pilot scheme to research the impact of a basic income for the arts.  Consequently, it will be delivered on an administrative and not legislative basis.   </p>  <p>  I believe that the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector post pandemic and it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

As part of the objective to increase social housing delivery, the plan recognises the significant role that Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have played as partners in social housing delivery and will continue to play over the next five years. </p><p>The CALF funding model has worked very successfully over the past 10 years, particularly for the larger AHBs that have adapted their delivery plans to utilise P&amp;amp;A-CALF funding. The increase in market rents over the intervening period has extended the geographic range of areas where dwellings can be delivered to the extent that projects have been completed in all local authority areas. </p><p>Under Housing For All, a specific objective, Action 4.10, is to &ldquo;<i>review the structure and operation of CALF to assess whether any refinements to the facility are required to support delivery of social housing by the AHB sector across a wider range of Local Authority areas.&rdquo;</i></p><p>One of the key purposes of this exercise is to review the structure of the P&amp;amp;A-CALF funding model to determine if it should be adjusted to support delivery by the AHB sector across a wider range of areas and what options might be available to enable this. </p><p>Work is underway on this review with the support of the Housing Agency and is on track to be completed by Q4 this year. </p></reply>

Victims may have needs beyond what can be provided via local authorities by way of emergency accommodation, and specialist legal or medical assistance may be required. As an immediate and short term response, a local authority may provide short-term emergency housing to persons forced to leave their homes because of domestic violence, without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support.</p>  <p>  My Department issued policy and procedural guidance to local authorities on the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports.</p></reply>

To resolve these, I asked the Workplace Relations Commission to engage with all parties aimed at reaching a collective agreement on a Framework for the future delivery of water services. In order to address the interests and concerns of each party to the transformation process, any such Framework must seek to accommodate:  </p> <blockquote> 	a.  The need to ensure Irish Water is given direct control of water services to provide for the safe and effective delivery of water services for citizens and to provide water services that meet the needs of a modern society and economy; <br /><br />b.  The union position that there is no forced transfer of the workforce; and<br /><br />c.  The need for local authorities to cease their involvement in public water services while also ensuring that they retain their capacity to continue to deliver on the full range of their vital statutory local government services and fulfil their social and economic development roles. </blockquote>  <p>In the context of such a wider overarching agreement on water sector transformation, it is recognised that local authority staff who transfer to Irish Water would do so on a voluntary basis.  Engagement at the WRC is ongoing at present. The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme. Government approved the enchanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2 billion. The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5.</p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with grant costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate grant rate for blockwork removal and replacement following receipt of advice from SCSI. The SCSI will be completely independent in their engagement with my Department on construction costs.</p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and  local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation  and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a  second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if  blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work  subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS;465 standard.</p>  <p>  - A new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for esssential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the  remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes  will also be examined.</p>  <p>  Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/  </p>  <p>  I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline. </p></reply>

Ireland is deeply concerned by the human rights abuses against civilians in Libya, including migrants and refugees. An important area of EU support to Libya remains migration management, including support to Libyan communities that host a particularly high number of migrants as well as to refugees and migrants themselves, and the protection of vulnerable groups. In strengthening the capacity of the relevant Libyan authorities, the focus of the EU is on training in Search and Rescue as well as in Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  In March 2022, the EU launched EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI to contribute primarily to the implementation of the UN arms embargo on Libya, however it also contributes to the disruption of the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks through information gathering and patrolling by planes. Ireland currently has three Defence Forces personnel deployed in staff office posts at the Operational Headquarters (OHQ) of EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI in Rome. In addition, the European Union Integrated Border Management Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya) was established in 2013. The protection and promotion of human rights is a central principle of EUBAM.  </p>  <p>  As well as support for migration and border management, important areas of EU assistance to Libya include protection of vulnerable populations; strengthening capacity for resilience; and recovery, stability and socio-economic development, including support to Libyan communities that host a particularly high number of people on the move as well as to refugees and migrants themselves. Key EU partners in Libya include UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration and UNICEF. </p>  <p>  Ireland condemns all human rights violations and abuses against refugees and migrants. At the 2019 Global Refugee Forum, Ireland undertook a number of pledges to help improve the situation of refugees and migrants, including yearly funding to the International Organisation for Migration, who are a key partner in the Libyan migrant response. We continue to work closely with our EU partners on issues related to migrants and asylum seekers in Libya and elsewhere, and to ensure that the lives, welfare and rights of migrants are protected.</p></reply>

This process has already delivered a number of transformational improvements for citizens at home and abroad, in particular, the rollout of the Passport Online service. Passport Online can now be accessed by first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. In 2021, approximately 90% of all applications were made online.</p><p>The next major reform underway is the replacement of the core technology underpinning the Passport Service. The current system, the Automated Passport System or APS, was launched in 2004 and will be replaced by a more modern, integrated system. An extensive procurement process, overseen by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), concluded in April 2021 with the award to a consortium led by Global. The Passport Issuance and Processing System (PIPS) contract was signed in September 2021 and the project officially commenced in November 2021.  This complex project is currently at an early stage and officials from my Department are actively working with the vendor to outline the high level design of the new system. Extensive detailed design, testing and phased implementation is to follow over the remainder of this year and much of 2023.  It is intended that the new system will be substantially operational by the end of 2023.</p><p>This will ensure the Passport Service benefits from a standard, scalable and resilient technical platform, capable of handling increased application volumes, while maintaining the high standards of security that are a hallmark of the Irish Passport. The Passport Online Service will remain in place as the fastest, easiest and safest way for citizens to apply.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.</p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Schools are free to choose whatever resources they feel supports the delivery of the curriculum in their school. My Department provides clear guidance to schools on the engagement of outside speakers and on the use of external resources to assist in delivering the curriculum. These guidelines are most recently outlined in updated circular 0042/2018 for primary schools and 0043/2018 for post primary schools. Where an external facilitator is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school.  He or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it.</p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. In SPHE, students have opportunities to explore different themes which focus on developing self-awareness and respect for others, and the skills of self-management, communication, coping, decision-making and relating to others.</p>  <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe Programme is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme. The programme seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protective skills by participation in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, inappropriate touch, secrets, telling and stranger danger. The primary SPHE programme as a whole is also due to be updated by the NCCA as part of the work resulting from the NCCA&rsquo;s review of RSE provision in schools.</p></reply>

There is a focus on actions to support greater female participation and greater participation amongst students who would not have traditionally considered subjects like Computer Science for the Leaving Certificate.</p>  <p>  For schools who are considering the introduction of LCCS onto their curriculum an &ldquo;Expression of Interest&rdquo; process is currently being carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) to ascertain teachers&rsquo; professional learning needs so as to support the effective delivery of the new subject in schools</p>  <p>  All of these supports have been designed to ensure there is capacity within the system for long-term, sustainable growth of Leaving Certificate Computer Science.</p></reply>

Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

However, following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; monthly youth unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the PUP &ndash; increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020. </p><p>Following the phased reopening of the economy over the latter half of 2021, most young people closed their PUP claims and returned to work, with the CSO estimating that there were approximately 321,000 young people in employment by Q3 2021 &ndash; significantly more than before the pandemic. This recovery resulted in a sharp downward trend in youth unemployment rates, with the standard youth unemployment rate falling to a low of 9 percent, and the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure to 10.2 percent, by end-November 2021.</p><p>While a slight increase was observed in the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure of youth unemployment following the temporary reintroduction of public health restrictions in early December, I am confident that the vast majority of these young people will shortly return to work, following the widescale easing of restrictions.</p><p>While it is welcome that the youth unemployment rate has reduced and returned to pre-pandemic levels, it is critical to continue to minimise potential scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs during the pandemic and young people who face difficulties or higher barriers to entry.</p><p>Accordingly, my Department has introduced &ndash; with funding allocated in Budget 2022 &ndash; a series of targeted employment supports under <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025</i>, the Government&rsquo;s employment services strategy. These include:</p><p>- Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.</p><p>- Launching the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more. While the programme has no age limit, it should be particularly attractive to young people looking to gain valuable work experience. 4,000 places on the programme have been ring-fenced for young people.</p><p>- Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long-term unemployed young people.</p><p>My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities. These are likely to be of particular relevance to young people seeking to enter the labour market for the first time. As part of Budget 2022 and Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are providing an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people, including young persons, to have the opportunity to upskill or reskill for employment into a new sector. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

While some elements of the means testing arrangements are common to all schemes, there are some elements which vary from scheme to scheme.</p>  <p>  The assessment of savings and other capital reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital are in a position to use those savings to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means tested welfare payment.</p>  <p>  In the means assessment for a personal rate state pension non-contributory entitlement, the first &euro;20,000 of capital an applicant holds is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  For disability allowance, an applicant can have up to &euro;50,000 in savings and still receive the full rate of payment; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  Where a person has been in receipt of disability allowance immediately before becoming entitled to state pension non-contributory, and could stand to lose out financially due to the different means testing criteria, legislation provides that the rate of state pension non-contributory payable is at least equal to the due rate of disability allowance applicable in the same circumstances. This ensures that disability allowance recipients are not financially worse off when they move to receive state pension non-contributory. This provision has been applied in the case of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p><p>Carer's Benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for. It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks. The current weekly rate is &euro;225.00.</p><p>To be eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, a person must have at least 156 contributions paid at any time between their entry into insurance and the time they make a claim for Carer's Benefit. They must have:</p><p>- 39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year or</p><p>- 39 contributions paid in the 12-month period before the start of Carer's Benefit or</p><p>- 26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the year before that.</p><p>The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which a claim is made. So, for claims made in 2022, the relevant tax year is 2020.</p><p>PRSI contributions at Class A, B, C, D, H and E are counted towards Carer's Benefit.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.

In addition, last November my officials hosted a webinar that attracted over 150 stakeholders, where a presentation on the procurement process was followed by a 90-minute question and answer session and an invitation to submit views on the content of the Phase 2 request for tender.

Under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1), the Government extended the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with, or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. Changes to the eligibility conditions for the payment have been made on an ongoing basis in line with changes to public health advice.</p>  <p>  The most recent change has been that the duration of payment for those considered a probable risk was reduced to 7 days from 14 January 2022. From that date, asymptomatic people who are close contacts and who have had their immunity boosted are not required to restrict their movements and are not entitled to receive enhanced Illness Benefit. Immunity is considered boosted if the person has received a booster or third vaccination or has had a Covid-19 diagnosis since 1st December 2021. This change complies with public health guidance in relation to a person's vaccination status.</p>  <p>  Enhanced Illness Benefit is hence not payable for an asymptomatic parent who stays at home to care for their child who is ill with Covid-19. This is similar to the situation for parents caring for children with any other illness.</p>  <p>  If, however, a parent in this situation starts showing symptoms of Covid-19, they should immediately self-isolate and, in this circumstance, can apply for enhanced Illness Benefit. Where a person has a Covid-19 diagnosis they may be paid for up to 10 weeks with appropriate medical certification from their GP.</p>  <p>  This Department will continue to keep the situation in relation to enhanced Illness Benefit under review in light of evolving public health guidance, to assist people who cannot work due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that claim processing is up to date, with processing targets met, or exceeded, on average for all the main scheme areas.</p><p>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria. Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigations and interaction with the customer, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.</p><p>While there have been high volumes of Covid Enhanced Illness Benefit applications over the past month as a result of the transmission of the Omicron variant, 92% of these applications are being processed within a week. Applications that require a manual intervention are taking approximately two weeks to process but my officials are working hard to minimise any delays. There are no backlogs arising in respect of standard Illness Benefit applications.</p><p>Overall, I am very pleased that my Department continues to ensure the customer experience has not been diminished by the effects of Covid 19 and that customer service has been maintained at a high level.

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory). As the actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at over &euro;300,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life.</p>  <p>  Where a person enters the social insurance system over the age of 56 they will not be able to make sufficient social insurance contributions to be awarded a State Pension (Contributory) on reaching 66 years of age because it has a minimum contribution requirement of 520 contributions (i.e. 10 years). In such cases a level of social insurance refund may be applicable.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95%  of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory). Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his/her own right. The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension. The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment. The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved. The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process. It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model, phasing out of the Yearly Average approach, allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes and measures to enhance pension provision for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years).</p>  <p>  The report was referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for its views which were published yesterday. Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically. My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any specific recommendation.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.</p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland. It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty. This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not qualify for the State Pension until age 66.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.   The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard including aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension Age.  The Commission also presented an option to allow people with a long contribution history of 45 years to access the State Pension (Contributory) at age 65. The Commission&rsquo;s Report stated that this should be implemented in the context of an increase in the State Pension Age.</p>  <p>  The report was referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for its views which were published yesterday.  Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations, their implications, and what would be required to implement them.  They are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work and get those views before reaching conclusions on any of the specific recommendations.  Once that is done, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Calculation of an applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to State pension (contributory) is based on their social insurance record from their date of entry into insurable employment until pension age, currently 66 years.  Pension entitlement depends on factors such as a person&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment. Depending on an applicant&rsquo;s individual social insurance history, their entitlement is assessed under a number of different tests to determine if they qualify for a pension. Where an applicant satisfies the criteria under more than one of these entitlement tests, the most financially beneficial rate of pension will ultimately be awarded.</p><p>According to the most recent records of the Department as of 31 December 2021, there are some 46,000 cases where State pension (contributory) was disallowed between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021 - typically, because the initial application based on their Irish insurance record  did not satisfy the scheme conditions - and which were subsequently awarded and are in payment at 31 December 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>SPC claims disallowed and then awarded as at 31/12/2021</th>       <th><div> 2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020 </div></th>       <th><div> 2021</div></th>       <th><div> Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td><div> 16,377</div></td>       <td><div> 14,200</div></td>       <td><div> 15,577</div></td>       <td><div> 46,154</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Please see below the most recent available figures for the number of State pension (contributory) claims which were disallowed in each of the past three years and remain disallowed.  These figures do not include applicants who have since died.  Recently disallowed figures in 2021 may include cases where entitlement is still being assessed under further tests, such as on the basis of applicants&rsquo; foreign employment records. <table>    <tr>       <th>SPC claims disallowed and not awarded as at 31/12/2021</th>       <th><div> 2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020 </div></th>       <th><div> 2021</div></th>       <th><div> Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td><div>3,939 </div></td>       <td><div>3,544</div></td>       <td><div>4,763</div></td>       <td><div>12,246</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For those who do not qualify for the State pension (contributory), there are other State pension payments available, depending on an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  State pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested, residency-based payment for persons of pension age, based on the applicant's share of assessable household means.  The maximum rate payable equates to 95% of the maximum rate of state pension (contributory).</p><p>If a person&rsquo;s spouse has a State pension (contributory), the person may qualify for an Increase for qualified adult (IQA) payable with their spouse&rsquo;s pension (means-tested on their own means). The rate of IQA payable may amount to 90% of the maximum State pension (contributory), depending on the rate of State pension (contributory) in payment to the person&rsquo;s spouse and the person&rsquo;s own means, solely or jointly held.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date, over 870,000 people have received payment under the scheme at a cost of &euro;9 billion and over 28 million payments have issued.</p>  <p>  The PUP scheme closed to new applications on 8 July 2021. </p>  <p>  The PUP scheme re-opened from 7 December 2021 to support persons who had lost their income from employment on or after that date as a result of the decision to temporarily impose restrictions on the trading of certain business sectors to slow the spread of COVID. These restrictions had a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality, the night-time economy, and the arts and entertainment sectors. </p>  <p>  The re-opening of the PUP scheme was specifically targeted at persons who were directly affected by the trading restrictions introduced on 7 December 2021. It did not involve a general re-opening of the scheme. The PUP scheme subsequently closed on 22 January 2022 following the lifting of restrictions on that date.</p>  <p>  Just over 48,000 individuals benefitted from the re-opening of the PUP scheme since 7 December. Processing of claims is up to date. Where a person did not qualify or supplied insufficient information to enable a decision on their claim, they were notified of this. Where a person subsequently contacted my Department to query the non-payment of their claim, follow-up action took place. Currently, there are no processing backlogs. </p>  <p>  COVID (Enhanced) Illness Benefit is a scheme that was introduced in March 2020, to support people who are incapable of work or who are required to self-isolate, as a result of a COVID diagnosis or being a probable source of infection.  To date a total of 416,175 COVID Illness Benefit related claims have been processed of which 382,587 have received a payment.  </p>  <p>  The majority of the standard Illness Benefit claims are automatically processed once medical certification from a GP and an application from the customer has been received.  </p>  <p>  Applications for COVID Enhanced Illness Benefit increased significantly during January due to transmission of the Omicron variant.  92% of these applications are processed within a week. Applications that require officer review to ensure eligibility for payment can take longer to process.  My officials are working to clear all claims as quickly as possible with additional resources allocated to this work as a priority. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case which he wishes to query, my officials are available to assist.</p></reply>

Under Article 13 of the Social Welfare (Appeals) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. 108/1998), if an Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the case is of such a nature that it can be properly determined without a hearing, the appeal may be determined summarily. </p><p>Due to the public health restrictions arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, in-person hearings were suspended in March 2020 and remained suspended from then, with the exception of a small number of weeks in August and September 2020.  </p><p>Oral hearings have been successfully conducted online or by telephone since October 2020 and these types of hearings will continue.

It was published in December 2021. It provides important evidence of the additional costs that people with a disability face in their day-to-day lives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy. As the evidence in the Cost of Disability in Ireland report has implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government approach is required to develop appropriate and timely responses and to ensure that everyday costs are reduced for people with disabilities and their families. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the coordination of this whole-of-government response is being carried out under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS). The NDIS is one of two national policy frameworks through which the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland are progressively realised. In addition to advancing key actions under the NDIS, my Department supports the implementation and monitoring of the NDIS by coordinating the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG). The Group is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D., and is attended by representatives of Departments, Agencies and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  The Cost of Disability in Ireland report was considered by the NDISSG in December 2021, within 24 hours of publication. Indecon International Research Economists presented the findings of their research to the NDISSG and it was agreed that at the next NDISSG, which will take place in March, the Group will discuss the approaches to be adopted to act on the findings and conclusions of the report.  The Group will examine meaningful action to reduce day to day costs for people with disabilities in Ireland. Aligning the findings and recommendations of the Cost of Disability in Ireland report to the NDIS will ensure that recommendations can be properly considered at whole of government level and that progress against actions taken will be monitored by the NDISSG and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  Although the report provides an estimated additional cost range for people with a disability, the exact additional costs for any individual person with a disability will vary considerably depending on, for example, the age of the individual, the severity of disability, the nature of the disability and the household type. Through the NDIS, we will explore cross-Government ways in which the different dimensions of additional costs can be addressed fairly, equitably and sustainably. </p></reply>

The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is currently supporting more than 55,000 families to offset these costs, with a recent review of the NCS revealing that:</p><p>-  38% of families reported that half or more of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p><p>-  56% reported that they had more money to spend; and </p><p>-  28% reported that they were working more (with 8% reporting they would not be in work without the NCS).  </p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and reduce the impact that this might have on choices about employment.</p><p>The recommendations of an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for early learning and childcare were adopted by Government in December.  This marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>The Expert Group recommended a number of developments to the NCS.  The recommendations include extending the universal subsidy to all children under 15 which was announced in Budget 2022.  The report also recommends increasing the value of the universal NCS subsidy and revising the approach to calculating subsidies for families with multiple children.  </p><p>The new funding model also recommends a new approach to fee management.  This will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access a new funding schemes in 2022.  </p><p>The introduction of this requirement (with the approach to fee management to be developed over time) means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS, the NCS reform announced in Budget 2022 and indeed any reforms to the NCS in future Budgets can be fully realised.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach has confirmed that the Minister for Justice will have the leading role. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a number of commitments in respect of DSGBV, including a plan for additional refuge spaces. Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review examines current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services, unmet need and proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review has made a number of recommendations on the location of refuge facilities, funding and future configuration of services that will support the needs of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  Government will be guided by the recommendations of the Review. I expect that the implementation process for the Review will identify priority areas where there is greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV. A draft of the Review has been shared with all stakeholders on the Monitoring Committee of the 2nd National DSGBV Strategy and it will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Tusla allocated &euro;28m in core funding for DSGBV services and an additional &euro;2m in contingency funding to address challenges arising from COVID-19.  Core funding of services will increase to &euro;30m for 2022 and additional resources have been allocated to address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review.  </p>  <p>  The impact of Covid and recent tragic events have shown the horrific effect of DSGBV on women, communities and society. In recent weeks I have been involved in discussions with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice as part of considerations by the Government to address the impact of DSGBV. The Minister for Justice will soon publish the 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV which I believe will present a comprehensive and targeted response to the critical issues involved, with a particular focus on prevention. </p></reply>

If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. Referrals to Tusla increased by 8% in 2021. </p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify where a child is listed on the Child Protection Notification System. There is a 24/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.   </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved.</p>  <p>  In relation to dialogue regarding children at risk, the Department chairs a statutory interdepartmental committee on Children First where matters of risk and safeguarding, across all Government areas, are reviewed regularly. </p></reply>

My Department has the coordinating role in respect of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the steering group of which is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D.. Incorporated into this structure is the Disability Stakeholder Group, which provides independent monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy.  It is a voluntary group of 26 individuals with expertise and lived experience of disability.  Members include DPOs, representatives from disability organisations, alongside individuals, persons with lived experience, family members and academics.  The current iteration of the DSG (DSG 6) commenced this year following an expression of interest for members last Summer.  </p><p>In addition to these two more formal consultation groups, my Department also seeks to use wider public consultation through submissions, surveys and online and in person workshops to ensure that as many views from disability groups and stakeholders are collated and incorporated into policy developments.  </p></reply>

The Acts cover nine grounds of equality, including that of disability.  In addition, the Acts prohibit discrimination in the provision of accommodation services against people who are in receipt of rent supplement, housing assistance, or social welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual considers that they have been discriminated against based on one of the named grounds, it is open to them to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  </p>  <p>  My Department conducted a consultation seeking the public&rsquo;s views on a review of the Equality Acts (Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015), which ran from July to December last year. The review will examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and promoting equality, including in relation to disability. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. Our determination to improve services and supports for people with disabilities and their families is clear in our Programme for Government. My colleague at the Department of Health, Minister Donnelly, secured an additional package of &euro;115m in Budget 2022 (including &euro;10m one-off Covid funding for specialist community-based disability services which are delivered or funded by the HSE, and builds on the &euro;100m funding allocated in 2021 to enhance these specialist disability services.   </p>  <p>  The Disability Capacity Review to 2032 sets out the Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements up to 2032.  This review has carefully drawn on best available evidence and information to estimate the scale of current outstanding need for HSE-funded disability services, and how the scale and shape of need is likely to evolve over the years to 2032. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on preparing an Action Plan for Disability Services 2022-2025, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to work towards implementing the Disability Capacity Review.</p></reply>

Youth Officers provide an important support role to my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at local level. My officials hold quarterly meetings with the ETBs and these meetings assist my Department in identifying service needs and emerging issues, particularly for vulnerable young people. </p>  <p>  The UBU scheme which is operated by the ETB's is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process. </p>  <p>  The APNASR Tool allows each Education and Training Board (ETB) to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. </p>  <p>  The ETB carries out an analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data to identify and evidence the needs of young people.  This results in a Service Requirement that is the basis for an application by organisations under UBU Your Place Your Space.  This process ensures equality for all youth services applying for UBU Your Place Your Space Funding. </p>  <p>  DCEDIY also maintains close contact with 30 national youth organisations which it funds under the Youth Service Grant Scheme. The Minister and officials meet formally with these organisations twice a year to share knowledge and information on developments or challenges in the youth sector. This provides a forum for organisations to give information on national issues but also identify specific locations that require additional focus. Throughout Covid-19, the Department engaged with a representative group from the sector on pandemic specific issues including the regular updating of national guidelines for the youth sector relating to COVID.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also meet formally with youth organisations on an individual basis when the need arises and also maintain informal contacts.  </p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic, the Department will continue to ensure there is sufficient engagement with this important sector which provides enormous value to young people.</p></reply>

Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for the greater number of separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports and airports.</p>  <p>  SCSIP who arrive in Ireland are received into care. These children are placed by Tusla either in specialist residential care centres with a maximum of six children, or with specifically recruited foster families. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card, access to education services and have a social worker allocated to them.    </p>  <p>  The basis for care of a SCSIP is different from the general child in care population; they are not received into care to protect them from their family but rather for welfare reasons due to their separation from their primary carers, which can be  as a consequence of war or persecution. </p>  <p>  The right to family reunification is a well-established principle of human rights law and of particular relevance to SCSIP. Given that it is a statutory right of SCSIP to apply for family reunification Tusla is of the view that its role is to ensure that those rights are upheld and further, to support the applicant in their application for family reunification as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Consequently, reunification work has evolved to be a key piece of the support Tusla staff provide to SCSIP in State care and who are eligible to apply.  The process of reunification is commenced as soon as the young people come to the attention of Tusla with an aim to re-establish contact with the family of origin as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Centre of Excellence has oversight of the implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>and supports ongoing work to implement the <i>Framework </i>through funding initiatives, centralised support and monitoring of annual progress. As part of monitoring requirements, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress on implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>on an annual basis. </p><p>All publicly funded HEIs have action plans in place to address this issue and have assigned responsibility to a member of senior leadership, most often in the form of the Vice-President for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. The HEA Centre of Excellence works closely with these stakeholders to both support and monitor progress in our goal to end sexual violence and harassment in higher education institutions. This work includes funding and support of targeted projects, such as the Speak Out anonymous reporting tool that was launched last year. </p><p>An expert Advisory Group was established in 2021 to advise my Department and the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion on policy relating to addressing sexual violence and harassment in Irish higher education institutions. This group of experts provides advice on consent framework implementation and future areas of priority in relation to ending sexual violence and harassment in higher education. The advisory group consists of the independent members of the original task force that developed the framework and other relevant experts and stakeholders. The group is currently developing an implementation plan following the recent publication of reports on student and staff experiences of sexual violence and harassment. The recommendation mentioned by the Deputy will come before the advisory group for consideration as part of its ongoing work in this area.</p></reply>

But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p><p>My Department will now work with the Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in the HEA, the higher education sector and the HEA Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to implement the recommendations in these reports. </p><p>Data from annual HEI progress updates to the HEA on implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>and the findings of the survey reports will provide an evidence base for any funding and priority areas identified in the reports&rsquo; recommendations. My intention is to develop an implementation plan to consolidate the advances that have been made in this area since the publication of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>in April 2019.

In line with the prevailing public health advice, my Department has implemented a suite of measures to help reduce the spread of the virus. This has unavoidably led to a reduction in processing capacity across many business areas at certain times. However, it is important to say that citizenship applications have continued to be accepted and decisions have issued at all times during the pandemic.</p><p>Last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were delivered, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p><p>From the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. </p><p>Following an initial assessment of new applications, all applicants are issued with an acknowledgement and an application reference number. It is open to any applicant to contact the Citizenship Division of my Department at <i>www.citizenshipinfo@justice.ie</i>at any time, for an update on their application.</p><p>A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times to between 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022.  </p></reply>

The IPS intends piloting  electric vehicles at two sites, to determine deliverables and suitability to its requirements. Two charging points will be installed to facilitate this pilot project. These will be for IPS fleet vehicles only at this juncture.I am advised that current market analysis by the IPS indicates that there are no viable electric vehicles that will currently facilitate a move to electric vehicles for prisoner escort cellular transport, based on current commercial vehicle range capacities and reliability. </p><p>As part of any expansion of an electric vehicle programme, the IPS will need to establish a national network of electric vehicle charging points at prisons and other IPS sites. </p><p><b>Courts Service</b></p><p>Works to facilitate the installation of car chargers were included in the specifications for the seven courthouses under the Courts Bundle PPP project, which were delivered in 2017/18. A similar approach will be taken for all future courthouse construction/refurbishment projects.</p><p>Currently, there are electric car chargers installed at Wexford Courthouse and Mullingar Courthouse. Chargers are currently being installed at the Mulgrave Street Limerick and Anglesea Street Cork courthouses. There are plans to install chargers at Waterford Courthouse, Letterkenny Courthouse and Drogheda Courthouse in the near future. In each case, two car charging spaces are being provided. The Court Service does not have any electric vehicles. </p><p><b>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</b></p><p>There are currently 49 electric vehicle charging points installed at sixteen Garda station locations, as detailed in the table below. The Fleet Management and Estate Management divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently liaising to identify and prioritise additional Garda stations for electric vehicle charging point installation.</p><p>There are currently 11 electric vehicles in operation across the Garda fleet.  A further 30 have been ordered with expected delivery in Q2 2022. It is planned that these electric vehicles will be allocated to Garda Stations that currently have charging points. There are currently 3218 vehicles in the Garda fleet, of which electric vehicles represent 0.34%, with an anticipated rise to 1.27% at the end of 2022. </p><p>The purchase and allocation of vehicles is made on the basis of identified operational demands and the availability of resources, and is reviewed on a continual basis. The allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis to ensure the best match with operational requirements.   <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Location </b></th>       <th><b>No of EV Charging Points </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fitzgibbon Street </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballymun </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Claremorris </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cong </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Knock </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Garda HQ </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Garda College </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rathfarnham </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blanchardstown </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drogheda </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westport </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Airport </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athlone </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stepaside </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>49</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible in 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. </p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. As part of the consultation process, two advisory groups have also been established comprising a subset of (1) NGOs and (2) practitioners and academics to further engage on issues emerging from the initial consultation phases.</p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. As part of the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill, specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge. An action to publish the new family justice strategy will be included in Justice Plan 2022. </p>  <p>  To better inform further discussion on parental alienation, my Department arranged for research to be carried out last year, with the Research and Data Analytics Unit of my Department having prepared a research brief.</p>  <p>  Following a competitive tender process in May, research commenced on this important work in June. The aims of the research included to:</p>  <p>  - Identify the various definitions and characteristics of parental alienation being used internationally.</p>  <p>  - Investigate what is known about the prevalence of this issue (in Ireland or internationally) through examination of the literature.</p>  <p>  - Identify and outline the various approaches and responses being taken in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of parental alienation (legislative and otherwise).</p>  <p>  - Describe, outline and evaluate any studies which have examined the effectiveness of these various international approaches and assess the relevance of these studies to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that a draft report was received by my Department at the end of November and is now being reviewed. It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area.</p>  <p>  The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations.</p></reply>

I am currently leading work on a new whole of government Domestic, Sexual, Gender Based Violence strategy to tackle these horrendous crimes.</p>  <p>  This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic violence.</p>  <p>  The Strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. In the coming weeks, I will begin a final round of consultation so that I can publish the strategy and associated implementation plan as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, depending on the circumstances of the individual case, a perpetrator of domestic violence may be charged with specific offences such as an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, murder, manslaughter, a sexual offence, the offence of coercive control, or the offence under section 33 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 of contravention of a domestic violence order.</p>  <p>  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender; in that process, identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. Section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 provides that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in the context of a marriage, civil partnership or an intimate and committed relationship, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing. This sentencing provision applies to any offence that involves violence or the threat of violence to a person. </p>  <p>  These provisions, as with all criminal legislation, are kept under review to ensure they remain effective, proportionate and fully compliant with due process and the Constitution. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced my intention to publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation.  While both are covered by existing law, I will be proposing changes to make the law clearer and stronger.</p></reply>

In June 2019, the Government approved the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of such cameras by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will also provide for the extension of the circumstances in which Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) devices may be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My Department engaged extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda oversight bodies and strategic partners during the preparation of the General Scheme, as well as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on 29 April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of March 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.  </p>  <p>  I should point out that while this will not be an excessively long Bill, the issues that it addresses such as privacy rights and data protection, are complex.  All use of recording devices under the Scheme is linked to Garda functions, namely the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal offences, public order and public safety, and safeguarding the security of the State. </p>  <p>  While Garda&iacute; have extensive common law powers at their disposal when carrying out their functions, it is important to have in place a modern and robust statutory framework to set standards and procedures in relation to the use of recording devices and to provide appropriate oversight of the use of the powers, in particular where they could infringe on the privacy or data protection rights of citizens.</p>  <p>  Digital recording technology for policing purposes continues to evolve.  A number of safeguards will have to be built in to the legislation to ensure that any intrusions into a citizens private life are necessary and proportionate and are for justifiable policing purposes.  </p></reply>

To date, more than 1,400 IIP applications have been approved for investment with a value of over &euro;1 Billion.  </p>  <p>  The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years and the second phase of the review referred to by the Deputy is being considered by my officials. Any actions and recommendations beneficial to the programme will be assessed and evaluated and consideration will be given to their introduction.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, applications to the IIP continue to be accepted and examined by an independent Evaluation Committee and, where assessed positively, are submitted to me for approval.</p></reply>

It is a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting: fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Data Protection Commission have carried out an in-depth, independent review of community CCTV schemes. My Department is incorporating amendments into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill to address these findings. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on the 29th April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of March 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year. </p>  <p>  This Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. It is expected the Bill will be enacted in 2022.  The legislation, once enacted, will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  I am informed that  &euro;1m funding has been allocated in the Garda vote for the CCTV Scheme for 2022.</p></reply>

Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any role in the processing of individual vetting applications. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016, provides for certain convictions to become spent once 7 years have passed since the date of conviction. </p>  <p>  In general and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the following convictions may become spent:</p>  <p>  1. All convictions in the District Court for motoring offences which are more than 7 years old subject to the proviso that spent convictions for dangerous driving are limited to a single conviction.</p>  <p>  2. All convictions in the District Court for minor public order offences which are more than 7 years old.</p>  <p>  3. In addition, where a person has one, and only one, conviction (other than a motoring or public order offence) which resulted in a term of imprisonment of less than 12 months or a fine, that conviction is spent after 7 years. This provision applies to either a District Court or Circuit Court conviction.</p>  <p>  4. A conviction resulting in a non-custodial sentence can also become spent after 7 years. This means such a sentence imposed by a court of imprisonment for a term of 2 years or less, the execution of the whole of which is suspended for a period specified by the court and that suspension is not subsequently revoked in whole or in part by the Court, and is not in addition to a custodial sentence.</p>  <p>  There is no formal procedure to be gone through to have a conviction declared spent. If the conviction is eligible to be spent, it becomes spent once seven years has passed from the date of conviction.</p>  <p>  It is important to understand that while a conviction may become spent under Irish law, this does not mean that the conviction ceases to be part of the person's criminal record. The effect of the Act is that, although it remains part of the person&rsquo;s criminal record, the person will not be penalised in law or incur any liability for failing to disclose a spent conviction. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that in some cases, disclosure of a spent conviction is required in circumstances including for example for specified work, such as with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, or applying for a public service vehicle, private security, taxi or firearm licence. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not required to expunge the details of such offences from the Garda PULSE system and a court may also admit or require evidence regarding a spent conviction in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government commits in the Programme for Government to reviewing the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 and to broaden the range of convictions that are considered spent. As part of this review process, a public consultation on spent convictions was launched in October 2020. My Department is continuing work on identifying and assessing the possible implications of amending the 2016 Act so that the fairest possible outcomes can be achieved for the public.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team. Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  When separated children seeking international protection arrive at an Irish port the International Protection Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Border Management Unit contact Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to assess the child&rsquo;s circumstances. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that Tusla&rsquo;s assessment of the child&rsquo;s circumstances includes an assessment of how the child arrived in Ireland, and includes any concerns in relation to child trafficking. </p>  <p>  Separated children may present for reunification, sometimes with an agent, to be reunified with a family member in Ireland or the UK.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that under Tusla&rsquo;s obligations under the Child Care Act, 1991, and Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, 2015, Tusla considers the risk of harm that a young person(s) may be in, including working with other state agencies on the possibility that the child may have been trafficked.  </p>  <p>  If required, the child is received into care until a more extensive child protection and welfare assessment can be undertaken and interagency working continues as required. If the outcome of the Social Work assessment is that the child is at risk of harm and should not be reunified with the alleged guardian/parent, then in accordance with the Tusla/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na joint protocol, Tusla forwards notifications of child abuse (indicating suspected trafficking) to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who determine if a crime has been committed and any criminal investigations into trafficking.</p></reply>

Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide. Staff in these section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive those cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements. While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. </p>  <p>  Consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Department of Health or the Minister of Health to comment on terms and conditions of employment within the private sector.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. I can also confirm that there is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that from a Departmental point of view, the process has reached a final resolution.</p></reply>

These initiatives include: </p><p>- GP Liaison Nurses to manage direct referrals from GPs to ED; </p><p>- Geriatric Community Support; </p><p>- Enhancement and expansion of Frailty Intervention Therapy Team models; </p><p>- Community Response Teams (nursing and therapies); </p><p>- Community respiratory admission avoidance teams; </p><p>- Expansion of the National Ambulance Service Pathfinder initiative </p><p>- Additional home support hours and </p><p>- COPD outreach teams. </p><p>Emergency Departments across the country are experiencing high attendance levels. The EDs must prioritise those with serious or life threatening injuries and illnesses.  There are other options available to those requiring less urgent care. For example, many patients with limb injuries can go to an Injury Unit and others with illnesses needing less urgent treatment can be seen and treated by their GP or referred by their GP to an Assessment Unit the following day. </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised regarding the emergency department at Tallaght University Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In that respect, officials from my Department and from the HSE have held two rounds of discussions with the IDA, the most recent on 17 December last when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, including &euro;10m provided in the Budget, on top of the 2022 Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million.</p>  <p>  The Department / HSE has offered increased fees across a number of items and proposed the reintroduction of the Scale and Polish item. They also made it clear that these interim measures are designed to shore up the existing Scheme, pending the full root-and-branch review of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  These proposals were expedited to address not only the problem of access for patients, but also concerns expressed by dentists about the viability of the DTSS, and to some extent, to bring about alignment with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by dentists for PRSI patients.</p>  <p>  The Department is anxious to move the process on, in the interests of patients, and is hoping to meet the IDA again in the next couple of weeks to progress matters.</p></reply>

Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the Act must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act, i.e., before January 2022. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the review will comprise a three-part approach to appraise the operation of the Act, with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation. Independent research commissioned to inform the service user and service provider strands will form key elements of the review. </p>  <p>  As I stated during my appearance before the Joint Committee on Health on 8 December, it was my intention to appoint an independent Chair to lead the second phase of the review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  </p>  <p>  As the costs involved in contracting an independent Chair to conduct the review were estimated as exceeding &euro;25,000, the advice I received was that the Department was obliged under procurement rules to tender for the appointment.  </p>  <p>  Given the expertise required for the position, a small number of candidates, identified as having suitable experience, were contacted and invited to tender for the role of independent Chair.</p>  <p>  Following the tender process, I have now appointed Ms Marie O'Shea B.L. as the independent Chair for the second phase of the review. Ms O&rsquo;Shea has legal expertise, as well as experience in project management and in healthcare sector research. I look forward to receiving the Chair's final report, incorporating her conclusions and any recommendations, in due course.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Department is precluded from funding the purchase of equipment such as Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) equipment by contractors under TAMS, unless they are also farmers.</p>  <p>  Under the terms and conditions for the LESS measure, the scheme is open to farmers who:</p>  <p>  (i) hold a Department identifier </p>  <p>  (ii) prior to submitting the online TAMS II application have a minimum of 5 hectares of land owned and/or leased or rented which have been declared under the Basic Payment Scheme or equivalent in the year of application or preceding year, or </p>  <p>  (ii) are engaged in the breeding, rearing or fattening of pigs and have a minimum of 60 production units at the time of application in accordance with Annex B of the Scheme; </p>  <p>  (iv) Nitrates Derogation applicants (as defined under Statutory Instruments 605 of 2017, 65 of 2018, 40 of 2020) are no longer eligible to apply and receive approval for LESS equipment. Furthermore, applicants farming at or above 170 kgs/N per hectare (as defined under Statutory Instrument 529/2020) in the year of application or the preceding year, will not be eligible for approval after 15 April 2022. Applicants farming below 170 kgs/N per hectare continue to be eligible for LESS equipment Or </p>  <p>  (v) in the case of a co-operative, all the members of the co-operative have to each independently meet the eligibility criteria laid down in (i), (ii) or (iii) above.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that a new Capital Investment Scheme under Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan will, if approved, provide support to the same category of applicants as TAMS II i.e. farmers or groups of farmers. While not yet finalised, Article 68 and Article 6 of the draft CAP regulations (12148/20) provide the legislative framework.</p>  <p>  The Department is fully committed to encouraging the use of this equipment. The interest in the LESS measure of TAMS II has been very strong with over &euro;55 million been paid to date for investments in LESS equipment under TAMS II.  </p></reply>

Critically, the availability of this volume of timber, at nearly 8.5 million cubic metres, stabilised supply to the processing sector in 2021. This is the highest volume ever issued in a single year. </p>  <p>  In addition, 264 kilometres of forest roads were licensed, more than double the target in the Climate Action Plan 2019. This is also the highest ever volume of forest roads issued in a single year. The number afforestation licences remained static, with 502 afforestation licences issued, which represents 4,245 ha of forestry.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of January 2022, the Department had 4,803 licence applications on hand. This figure has reduced from 6,100 in August 2021.  There will always be applications in the system, making their way from application stage to a licence.  The Forestry Licensing Plan for this year is currently being finalised and will be published shortly. It will build on the momentum achieved in 2021 and will focus on increasing the number of afforestation licences issued. We will continue to keep resources under review and will implement all practical process improvements which result from the review and analysis in train under Project Woodland.  </p>  <p>  Afforestation has not improved as we would like with just over 4,200 ha approved last year. Improving afforestation licensing is a key priority for 2022.  A greater concern for all of us must be that the number of afforestation applications has continued its downward decline in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Reversing this trend, I believe requires a concerted effort now, from everybody with an interest in seeing more trees planted in Ireland.  2022 will be a big year for farmers, with the arrival of a new CAP and new Forestry Programme and it is important that the benefits of afforestation are well understood by them.  My Department is, as always, ready to play its part and assist in improving communications.  We understand of course that licensing forestry activities has a role to play hence the importance attached to improved licensing output in 2022.  However, positive messaging around the benefit of afforestation is the responsibility of all, particularly those with a direct line of communication to farmers and landowners.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, I remain fully committed to delivering a licensing system which will meets the needs of the sector and of society and recent licensing trends demonstrate that we are making progress towards achieving this.</p></reply>
