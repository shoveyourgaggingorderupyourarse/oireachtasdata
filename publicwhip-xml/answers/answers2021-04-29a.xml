The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  The pilot quota-based scheme introduced in May 2018 following consideration of a detailed business case submitted by the sector, provided a quota of 150 general employment permits for the occupation of Dairy Farm Assistant.  This pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and the quota of 150 employment permits is now exhausted. </p>  <p>  Consideration of the submissions received to the current occupations lists review is underway, including from the farming sector, and scheduled to be finalised in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Following the advice of NPHET, the Government made the decision to move the entire country to Level 5 of the Framework for Living with COVID-19 (COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead) and for essential retail and services (including childcare) to remain open. </p><p>This has been followed by the recent Government announcement of a phased easing of public health restrictions that commenced on 12<sup>th</sup>April. The current public health measures will remain in place until 4 May. Government will meet in advance of that date to review the level of restrictions.</p><p>These decisions are not taken lightly, and the Government has worked to support businesses through this difficult time with a comprehensive range of measures for firms of all sizes. Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes and measures for businesses are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>A significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors was introduced in Budget 2021. The measures include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), now extended until the 30<sup>th</sup>of June, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p><p>The CRSS has provided vital support to businesses that have been forced to close or restrict access to their premises on foot of public health regulations. As we slowly and carefully start to reopen the economy, the Government has agreed to the extension of the CRSS until 30<sup>th</sup>of June 2021. There is provision in the CRSS for a &ldquo;restart week&rdquo; which allows a business to claim for an extra week upon reopening after restrictions are lifted, which will be of particular benefit as businesses start to re-open.</p><p>The Government are committed that there will be no cliff-edge end to the economic supports at the end of June. Government recognises that re-opening will be costly and will pose new challenges that will need to be sustained by continued supports and corrective measures to get the balance right between supporting recovery and cost to the Exchequer, and plans for this are currently in development. </p></reply>

Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. </p>  <p>  Ireland is wholly opposed to Israeli settlements, which are contrary to international law, and are damaging to the prospects of peace.</p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted on 23 December 2016, calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. This Resolution reflected the position already held by Ireland, the EU and the UN for many years.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises human rights issues in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory at the highest international levels, including most recently at the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two state solution which protects the future of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-29a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042900069#WRB01000"><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, my Department has worked to ensure that there are measures in place to help businesses to access appropriate financing in response to the challenges of trading in the environment brought about by COVID-19. Initially, this meant the adaptation or expansion of existing schemes to ensure support could be in place as quickly as possible. The first two such schemes to launch were the COVID-19 Business Loan available from Microfinance Ireland [MFI] and the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme [WCS]. </p>  <p>  MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders. It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk. </p>  <p>  Subsidised rates of interest have been applied in respect of MFI&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan with an interest rate of 4.5% available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the SBCI COVID-19 WCS, the maximum interest rate that can be applied to a loan is 4%, which represents a significant saving when compared with other similar lending in the market. </p>  <p>  While these adapted supports were deployed as quickly as possible, work was also under way on the development of a tailored loan guarantee scheme to fit the specific needs of COVID-19-impacted businesses. Launched in September of 2020, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme [CGS] makes up to &euro;2b in lending available to businesses that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Where eligible, the scheme also allows for the refinancing of other COVID-19-related debt. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 CGS was developed with the specific goal of widening the pool of participating lending institutions. To that end, the participating finance providers under the scheme include three banks, four non-bank lenders, and nineteen credit unions. The delivery of these schemes through commercial finance providers allows the Government to leverage existing lending infrastructure that these lenders have in place around the country, ensuring accessibility for impacted businesses. </p>  <p>  However, the operation of loan schemes through commercial finance providers also means that there is less scope to bring the interest rates down further than they are at present, as some interest must be charged by lenders if they are to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government. </p>  <p>  Significant effort was made to achieve the lowest interest rates possible under the scheme, but there are capital requirements that the participating finance providers must meet, as well as costs to them in delivering the scheme. As such, there is a variation in interest rates depending on the lender and the details of the loan sought, though 96% of loans drawn under the scheme have been provided at interest rates of between 2.5% and 2.99%.</p>  <p>  It should be noted also that each of the loan guarantee schemes described above allow for moratoria or interest-only payment periods, depending on the participating providers&rsquo; assessment. This should also help in providing a degree of flexibility for businesses approaching reopening.</p></reply>

I remain committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge through a nationwide ban on smoky coal and enhanced regulation of other solid fuels.</p>  <p>  The recent public consultation, which sought views on how we regulate all solid fuels that contribute to air pollution, was the first step in this process. My Department received more than 3,500 responses to the technical consultation, survey and questionnaire. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish these submissions alongside a new, legally robust, and evidence-based framework for how we regulate all solid fuels in the near future.</p></reply>

Taxi and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators, who are particularly dependent on the hospitality and tourism sectors, have faced a particularly pronounced drop in demand for their services.</p>  <p>  It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports with broad eligibility criteria for individuals and businesses which have been adversely affected by COVID-19. Many of these supports can be accessed by self-employed taxi drivers including liquidity and investment measures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Enterprise Support Grant and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) from the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that SPSV operators, like many self-employed individuals, face expenses such as insurance and car financing costs. That is why operators can avail of the Self-Employment Income Scheme. This allows recipients to earn up to &euro;960, net of expenses, in a given 8 week period without losing their entitlement to the PUP. Furthermore, individuals exiting the PUP may also avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant, a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV sector towards zero/low-emission vehicles and I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme from &euro;1 million in 2020 to &euro;15 million in 2021. Furthermore, in view of the particular challenges faced by operators of older vehicles, I have doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. Additional amounts are available for those switching to vehicles which are both electric and wheelchair accessible.  There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over 400 applications received to date.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided up to &euro;2.6 million to the NTA to enable it to waive standard vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021. In relation to age limits for taxis and hackneys, this is a matter for the NTA as statutory regulator. I can confirm, however, that the NTA has extended age limits for taxis twice since the start of the pandemic and I trust that the NTA will keep this issue under active review as the situation progresses</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue on insurance, I&rsquo;d like to inform the Deputy that the NTA has engaged with the insurance industry and will facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who suspend their licences will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  My Department and the NTA will also continue to engage from time to time with stakeholder groups, including driver representative groups. I am also due to meet with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs at its next meeting on Thursday 29 April.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also acknowledge the wealth of information which is available on the dedicated project website which outlines the development of the project since its initial consultation period and the changes that have taken place to the scope of the project and the rationale behind those changes. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that MetroLink&rsquo;s Preliminary Business Case has now been submitted to the Department and is being considered in line with the Public Spending Code. Once that consideration is complete I will bring the Preliminary Business Case to Government for its decision as is required by the Public Spending Code. If approved by Government, and subject to the completion of the necessary environmental and planning documentation, the project will then proceed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for its decision. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific development at Charlemont referred to by the Deputy, those particular construction works relate to a private development being constructed by a private company pursuant to a planning permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Details of that planning permission and conditions attached thereto are available to view on the website of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and operational issues as those referred to by the Deputy are a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to note that the NTA is currently reviewing the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area as it is required to do every six years under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, and indeed is the right thing to do given it is a twenty year rolling strategy. The review will allow for consideration of other potential projects such as possible new metro lines, over and above the metro lines proposed in the existing Strategy. </p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's statutory responsibility in relation to public transport infrastructure development in the GDA, I have referred the operational aspects of the questions to them for their consideration and direct reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. As of the week ending 23 April 2021, payments of over &euro;2.8 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;467 million have been granted to 48,600 employers in respect of almost 552,000 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021. Similarly, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme has also been extended to end June 2021.</p>  <p>  Motions seeking the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 30 June 2021 were debated in the House on Thursday 22 April, during which I reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment that there would be no cliff-edge end to the economic supports at the end of June.</p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission published a proposal on the reform of VAT rates in January 2018 which would allow Member States more flexibility in how they apply VAT rates.  In negotiations leading up to this proposal Ireland specifically recommended to the Commission to include defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment. Discussions on the proposal are ongoing. </p>  <p>  In advance of any change that might be made at EU level to the VAT rating of defibrillators and other products that pose difficulty for community groups, I am happy to draw your attention to the VAT compensation refund scheme, which compensates charities for the VAT they occur on their inputs, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.  The scheme took effect from 1 January 2018 but is paid one year in arrears. It is now open for charities to make a claim in 2021 for VAT costs arising in 2020. Charities will be entitled to a proportion of VAT based on the level of non-public funding they receive. A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Government is very committed to supporting community groups and we will continue to press for a reduction in the VAT rate on defibrillators at EU level. In the meantime, Irish VAT law must comply with the current VAT Directive and therefore defibrillators remain liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.</p></reply>

Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 formalises taxpayer confidentiality and reassures taxpayers that their personal and commercial information disclosed to Revenue for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure by Revenue to third parties.  Therefore, Revenue is precluded by reason of its taxpayer confidentiality obligations, from providing any details in relation to the company in question.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I propose to respond in general terms in relation to the operation of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the compliance checks conducted by Revenue on all employers who registered for and received funding under TWSS.    </p>  <p>  The TWSS operated by Revenue from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020, enabled employees, whose employers were affected by the pandemic, to receive supports directly from their employer. TWSS was available to employers who kept their employees on the payroll throughout the COVID-19 pandemic so that employers could retain links with employees for when business picked up after the crisis.  </p>  <p>  If an individual employee has a concern over how his/her employer has operated TWSS, he/she can see the amount of TWSS claimed by the employer on their behalf and included in their wages/salary by examining their pay slip or by logging on to their Revenue myAccount.   Any specific queries in relation to the amount of subsidy received would then be best raised by the individual with that individual&rsquo;s employer.</p>  <p>  I confirm that compliance checks were conducted by Revenue to ensure TWSS was operated correctly by employers who availed of TWSS.   I understand that where an employer received amounts under TWSS and the employer has not paid the subsidy amount to the specified employee or where the employer was not entitled to receive the subsidy as it did not meet the qualifying criteria, or the employee was not an eligible employee, the employer is required to refund these amounts to Revenue. </p></reply>

In this regard the Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions across several policy areas, including my Department, with 95% due to be completed by the end of 2021. At its most recent quarterly meeting in March, the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the Action Plan, reflected upon the considerable progress made in the first three months of this year.  Achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - The creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance, which has been engaging extensively with stakeholders since its inception;</p>  <p>  - The publication of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council, which came into force on 24 April, a number of months ahead of schedule;</p>  <p>  - The launch of a public consultation on proposals to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injury, particularly those of soft tissue, and provide further details on how these should be assessed. These also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and judiciary. Therefore, in addition to the lower awards and legal fees, the new Guidelines should provide more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB for claims settlement. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.  A reduction of the cost of claims should assist in lowering the cost of premiums, and Minister of State Fleming met with insurers earlier this month to press them on this issue. This was a fruitful series of engagements, with many insurers indicating that they would begin lowering premiums this year in response to the new Guidelines. I welcome this commitment and believe that consumers, small businesses and other groups should start to see the benefit of this as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, Minister of State Fleming and I look forward to continue working with colleagues and stakeholders to implement further aspects of the Action Plan, with a view to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

The applicant initially acquired a share of between 40% and 75% in a dwelling and rented the remainder from the local authority/ with an undertaking to acquire the remaining equity within a 25/30 year period.</p>  <p>  There are two types of shared ownership loans, "pre-2002 Index Linked shared ownership loans" and &lsquo;post-2002 shared ownership loans&rsquo;. Loans are made-up of a loan portion and a rental (leased) portion &ndash; most being a 50/50 split. Monthly payments are made on the loan borrowing and also a rental amount was paid. The two schemes differ in how the rental payments are calculated and the effect they have on the underlying rental equity portion outstanding.</p>  <p>  I note from your correspondence that Limerick City and County Council has offered a number of payment options available to the borrowers.  It is important that the borrowers now seek independent financial advice on this matter.

These guidelines &ldquo;Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities&rdquo; are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link. https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/24d9e-quality-housing-for-sustainable-communities-design-guidelines/ </p><p>Under the Climate Action Plan the Office of Public Works is putting in place a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alternatives in construction and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is carrying out a research and development project to examine life cycle analysis and embedded energy in buildings to compare the use of sustainable materials. </p><p>The review of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (known as the Constructions Products Regulations or &ldquo;the CPR&rdquo;) was confirmed by the European green deal in December 2019 and the European Commission&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup>Circular Economy Action Plan published in March 2020.  In parallel, the European Commission initiated discussion on an implementation plan for a future environmental life cycle assessment framework for construction products, looking at the impacts on the wider environment that occur during the whole life cycle of a construction product. The objective is to identify the strategic issues that need to be addressed with a view to the implementation of Basic Works Requirement 7 &lsquo;Sustainable Use of Natural Resources&rsquo; (BWR7) in the context of the current and the future revision to the Construction Products Regulation. </p><p>Ireland will be obliged to follow this harmonised procedure via harmonised technical specifications for construction products, when a consensus of approach emerges. In that regard, it would be counter to harmonisation to develop national rules for matters covered by the Internal Market regulation. </p><p>The value of sustainable building practices is also recognised in the new EU policy framework known as the Renovation Wave &ndash; which focuses on the multiple benefits arising from the energy efficient upgrade of homes and buildings more generally.Ireland welcomes and supports the Renovation Wave initiative and both my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate Action and Communications have provided inputs to help strengthen its impact. </p><p>The potential impact that construction has on the environment has been recognised in the National Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, 2020 published by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate Action and Communications. Actions include a commitment to update guidance on resource management in construction.  To this end, the Environmental Protection Agency has opened a public consultation on updated guidelines which can be accessed at the following link . </p><p>Furthermore, the Government has published a draft Circular Economy Strategy which sets out what a circular economy is, why Ireland needs to achieve it, and how national policy will develop to support that goal. The draft Strategy is also open for public consultation currently and can be accessed at: https://www.gov.ie/en/consultation/37078-public-consultation-on-the-proposed-publication-of-the-circular-economy-strategy/. </p></reply>

At a time of great difficulty for India, we wanted to show solidarity with a country and people with whom we have strong historical and modern day relations. The emergency donation of 700 oxygen concentrators to India is en route, coordinated  by the EU Civil Protection mechanism.  Ireland made a further offer of 365 ventilators and 1 oxygen generator, which was accepted by the Indian authorities and transport arrangements are in hand. </p>  <p>  We are glad to provide this support at a time of such need and to be doing so as part of a wider EU response.  EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, will have a virtual Summit meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi on 8 May and the issue of the pandemic will be a central theme of the discussions.  We hope that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of life-saving equipment, in tandem with the coordinated EU response,  will provide rapid and tangible support and solidarity with India at this distressing time. My thoughts especially are with the Indian community in Ireland which is deeply concerned for families and friends in India.  We are deeply grateful to the medical professionals from India who are making a major contribution to our own health services during the pandemic.</p></reply>

In response, the EU issued a statement on 11 March to call on Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in Hong Kong's democratic process and to end the persecution of those who promote democratic values. Ireland fully supports this statement. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, in response to the adoption of this law, the EU adopted Council Conclusions on 28 July 2020 expressing grave concern over the national security legislation for Hong Kong. These conclusions restated the EU&rsquo;s support for Hong Kong&rsquo;s high degree of autonomy under the &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; principle, expressed its solidarity with the people of Hong Kong, and set out a coordinated response package of measures in various fields, including asylum, migration, visa, and residence policy; controls on exports of specific sensitive equipment and technologies for end use in Hong Kong; and the operation of Member States&rsquo; extradition arrangements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong. </p>  <p>  In line with these Conclusions, the Government on 13 October agreed to suspend Ireland&rsquo;s Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong, which clearly signals Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the erosion of judicial independence promised under the One Country Two Systems principle.</p>  <p>  The matter has been discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on a number of occasions this year. Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to monitor the situation and raise our concerns with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities as appropriate. </p></reply>

This was seen as a critical need for continued operational capability and in line with the PSPC recommendation, the scheme was introduced, solely for this cohort.</p>  <p>  The sanction also provided that the scheme would be additionally offered to newly eligible Flying Officers for 2 subsequent years, 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  As set out under the terms therefore, there will  be a further iteration of the Scheme  for newly eligible Flying Officers in 2021. The Service Committment Scheme does not extend to other cohorts in the Air Corps as the sanction covering the scheme does not provide for this.</p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate that a recuitment campaign for Aircraft Apprentice Technicians has been recently launched and further recruitment intiatives within the Air Corps are also under consideration. </p></reply>

This process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration Process enables patronage transfers to take place for school communities which have decided to make this change. Where there is such local agreement, a school patron may seek to transfer patronage to a new patron under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  My Department facilitates such transfers of patronage where requested by the relevant school patron.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this way, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools.  In addition, an Irish-medium gaelscoil has recently changed patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, any school community which wishes to pursue a transfer of patronage should engage with their school patron in the first instance.</p></reply>

In planning and in designing the consultation process, the NCCA was mindful to take account of the very challenging circumstances facing teachers, students, school leaders, and their communities due to Covid-19. In order to allow as many opportunities for all those interested to engage with the process, this consultation is scheduled to remain open for a six-month period. Typically, consultations on draft subject specifications take place over a six to eight-week period. </p><p>The NCCA is using a range of consultation techniques including an online survey, focus group and bilateral meetings, and written submissions to gather and record the experiences and perspectives  of participants on all aspects of the draft specifications including the types of learning, teaching and assessment experiences set out for students.  </p><p>To raise awareness further of this opportunity to contribute to these curriculum developments and to enable as wide an engagement as possible, the NCCA is also working closely with stakeholders in several organisations within the Irish-medium education sector. The NCCA, for example, in collaboration with Gaeloideachas hosted an information session followed by consultative focus groups for teachers in L1/T1 settings in early March.

Many pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children may attend special schools or classes.  </p><p>I wish to advise that, in line with the Act, my Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils and young persons with special educational needs, including children who are Deaf or hard of hearing, to ensure that children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. </p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, work in partnership with parents to advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development.  The NCSE also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language.  The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>As regards the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (the NCCA) is currently reviewing and redeveloping the Primary Curriculum Framework NCCA have had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this work in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum.&rsquo;  Inclusive education and diversity is one of the eight principles of teaching and learning proposed.  One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able? to understand, interpret and use different forms of? communication including gesture, expression, spoken? language (English, Irish and other languages), printed? text, broadcast media, and digital media.Phase one of the consultation on the draft Primary Curriculum Framework is complete.  Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA  will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will opportunity for the NCCA to have continued engagement with children and teachers who use ISL in schools and to learn from their experiences.  It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.  </p><p>At post primary school level,  The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: <i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests. </p></reply>

A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. </p><p>As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected.  Of the 189 schools selected, 171 (90.5%) are DEIS and 18 (9.5%) are non-DEIS.</p><p>Both schools referred to by the Deputy submitted an Expression of Interest for the Hot Meals Scheme. They have separate roll numbers and are two separate entities despite the fact they are located on the same site. Unfortunately one of the schools was not selected and I appreciate that this is disappointing for the school.  </p><p>We have contacted all schools selected for the Hot Meals Scheme and are in the process of considering responses.  Further consideration will be given to the use of any excess capacity once we have confirmed the position with the selected schools.</p><p>Any further extension of the provision of hot meals will need to be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Since February this year, employment services staff are returning to their roles in activation, leading to an increase in the numbers of systematic engagements with jobseekers.  Under current Level 5 public health restrictions, these engagements continue to be carried out by phone. </p>  <p>  This week, my Department has issued weekly payments valued at &euro;119.9 million to 403,095 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). This is in addition to the 183,096 people who were on the Live Register at the end of March.</p>  <p>  The jobs of many persons currently on PUP  will return once restrictions ease, and sectors of the economy gradually re-open,  as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020.  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs My Department is currently developing a  service delivery model for systematic engagement with PUP recipients with a view to  providing this service to those PUP recipients at most risk of not returning to previous employment, in the near future.  </p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department,  along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is supporting initiatives to assist people, whose employment has been affected by the pandemic,  get back to work. </p>  <p>  These include:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres, with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Recruitment for these posts is almost complete, with an additional 85 job coaches now in place in these new roles.</p>  <p>  - Increasing the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long-term unemployed (over 12 months). </p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.</p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of PUP who wish  to pursue short term or part-time study, can continue to receive  a PUP payment, while undertaking these courses.  There are many options and supports available to those wishing to pursue short-term or part-time training or education, without a qualification period and without affecting their existing PUP entitlements.</p>  <p>  Anyone of working age, including PUP recipients may contact their local Intreo Centre to avail of employment services, discuss eligibility for schemes and further education and training opportunities. Employment Services staff can help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.  </p>  <p>  My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, including time spent on PUP, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme in the near future, as soon as public health restrictions allow.</p>  <p>  Work is nearing completion on the Government's  National Economic Plan and my Department&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy.  These strategies will set out how an expanded Public Employment service will utilise its increased capacity to deliver effective public employment services in a post COVID labour market with increased demands for such services amongst those who have permanently lost jobs arising from the pandemic. In addition, Pathways to Work will also set out strategies to respond to pre-COVID labour market challenges, namely underemployment and under participation in the labour market amongst certain groups. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants, a flat payment rate was introduced initially. This rate was the equivalent of the Jobseeker benefit rate for a two-person household. </p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment moved to 2 rates of payment;  a 3 rate structure was introduced with effect from 7 September; and a 4 rate structure is in place since 16 October. These changes more closely link the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned and make the scheme more targeted and fair. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account. </p>  <p>  The rate of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a self-employed person is calculated by reference to their reckonable income in either 2018 or 2019, whichever is the greater, as these are the last two years for which complete information is available in respect of the reckonable income of self-employed persons. Details of reckonable income are supplied to the Department by the Revenue Commissioners, and are supplied net of business related costs, including capital allowances.  When submitting returns to the Revenue Commissioners, self-employed persons can offset business related costs against gross trading income, with the resulting assessment to tax and PRSI based on the net profit or income accruing to the individual. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am aware that Garda&iacute; have highlighted scams of late where people have pretended to be from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, banks, delivery companies, businesses and even in recent weeks, the Department of Justice. </p>  <p>  I am informed that work is on-going in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle this issue. This includes, but is not limited to the issuing of advisory notices to members of the public warning against this criminal tactic and advising how to proceed should they be targeted.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) meet regularly with banking institutions, the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and representatives from 3ireland.   GNECB take preventive action in an effort to disable Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) numbers, which both prevents and disrupts fraudulent activity.  VoIP Numbers are commonly purchased in batches and in circumstances where a number is identified as being involved in fraud, GNECB endeavour to get it and any other number purchased in the same batch disabled.</p>  <p>  GNECB also liaise with ComReg to establish if the VoIP was registered in Ireland. In the first two months of 2021, GNECB have successfully engaged with VoIP providers to have 12 numbers disabled that were identified as being used for fraudulent purposes.  In addition, GNECB have also conducted enquiries on websites suspected of being involved in fraud and in the first three months of 2021, they  have successfully suspended 80 such websites that were being used to target Irish residents. </p>  <p>  In addition, GNECB actively engages with the BPFI and the Irish Telecommunications Security Fraud Forum (ITSFF) with regard to providing advice and assistance relating to all cybercrime threats.  This engagement is ongoing in relation to disrupting suspected fraudsters' ability to target unsuspecting victims through SMS (smishing) messages.</p></reply>

Local and international evidence increasingly suggests that this multidisciplinary approach should be led by a child psychiatrist with an interest in child and adolescent gender identity. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is committed to the development by the HSE of a well-governed and patient-centred health care service for adults and children in the transgender community, in line with the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>On the 23rd of February, the Minister for Health announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.  </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). </p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by: </p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; </p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; </p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here: </p><p>No vaccine has currently been approved for ages younger than 16 years.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine. </p><p>Mandatory hotel quarantine is also necessary in circumstances where passengers coming from non-designated states, do not provide evidence that they have a negative or &lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result from a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival into Ireland.</p><p>The Government continues to evaluate wider policy on international travel as informed by the epidemiological situation and public health advice.  </p><p>As of 17<sup>th</sup>April, passengers who are fully vaccinated and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland.

Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. Otherwise, two visits per week should be facilitated. The duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident and should not be less than one hour. Where there is high vaccine coverage, 2 people may visit at a time but there is no requirement to limit the number of nominated visitors.</p>  <p>  If a visitor is fully vaccinated and is visiting in a room with a resident who is fully vaccinated with no other person present, they do not need to wear masks or avoid physical contact.</p>  <p>  A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed at www.hpsc.ie.</p>  <p>  Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. </p>  <p>  I have written to HIQA and all nursing home providers to emphasise the need to ensure visits take place to the greatest extent possible in line with the new guidance. I have also encouraged providers to communicate frequently and clearly with residents and families on the matter of visiting.</p>  <p>  The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges. I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is working closely with Public Hospitals to arrange treatment for clinically suitable patients and as of the end of March, almost 6,000 Inpatient and Day cases, and 4,000 G.I. Scopes offers of treatment had been accepted year-to-date. In terms of Outpatients, the National Treatment Purchase Fund had arranged almost 7,000 appointments by the end of March.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that as of the end of March 2021, more than 6,700 patients had been seen at City West Convention Centre across a range of outpatient and daycase clinics since the site started to be used for HSE activity in August 2020. There are currently a number of initiatives taking place in conjunction with Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland, Ireland East, and Dublin Midlands Hospital Groups.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in order to continue to provide outpatient access for patients, there has been substantial development in virtual outpatient consultations across acute hospital services. The use of telemedicine has allowed Outpatient activity to continue for clinically suitable patients, reducing the footfall in hospitals and facilitating infection control and social distancing requirements. The HSE has advised that a total of 657,415 virtual outpatient consultations took place in 2020 from March to December (when reporting process commenced). This represents over 27% of the OPD activity during this period. The HSE has further advised that at the end of March 2021 a total of 227,122 patients had been seen virtually year to date.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, including mental illness in a person under 16 years of age. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme or the age limit in relation to mental illness at this time. However, I wish to inform you that it is proposed that the LTI Scheme would be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. Further information on the medical card scheme and the application process are available at www.hse.ie.</p>  <p>  Finally, persons may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. Details on how to claim are at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

These centres, which are opening in areas where the number of positive cases is particularly high, will allow people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 to get a free test without having to contact their GP first. Around 20% of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. The HSE aims to carry out 300-500 COVID-19 tests per day at each walk-in centre and any detected cases will be referred to contact tracing in the same way as detected cases that were referred through by a GP. </p>  <p>  The locations where centres are being opened have been decided based on local disease prevalence and on the advice of public health directors. The locations will change week-on-week. Decisions on future locations of walk-in centres will be made following assessments made by the Directors of Public Health in the HSE based on the prevailing incidence rates. Further information including the current test centre locations and dates of operation are available on the HSE website through the following link:</p>  <p>  https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/testing/covid-19-walk-in-test-centres.html. </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

The goal of my Department and the HSE is to develop a sustainable medical workforce to staff the health service with the appropriate number of NCHDs in training and consultants to deliver the service. Ireland is committed under the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Global Code on the Recruitment of International Health Personnel to strive for self-sufficiency with regard to the training and supply of medical specialists. </p>  <p>  The policy on the application of EU community preference in the recruitment process for postgraduate medical training places was put in place in 2013 following a request by the Department of Health, supported by the HSE, to support this policy of self-sufficiency.  Available specialist training places are allocated by the training bodies in the first instance to those candidates who at the time of application are citizens of Ireland or nationals of another Member State of the European Union. This includes non-EEA nationals who are deemed to be qualifying or permitted family members of nationals of a Member State under the EU Directive 2004/38/EC (Free Movement Directive) as transposed into Irish domestic law, European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015. S.I. No 548 of 2015 and have been granted the right of residence or permanent residence (i.e., holders of GNIB Stamp 4 EUFAM).</p>  <p>  It is recognised that non-EEA nationals play a significant role in the Irish health service and in November 2020 I announced changes to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, which has removed the barriers faced by some non-EEA doctors in applying to national training programmes. Since November 2020, all doctors who are currently registered in, or have established eligibility for registration in, the General Division of the Medical Council&rsquo;s register, are now eligible for registration in the Trainee Specialist Division. All EU and non-EEA NCHDs, if they meet the eligibility criteria set out by each postgraduate training body, are eligible to apply to postgraduate medical training programmes. </p>  <p>  The HSE has requested a formal review of the current policy on the application of EU community preference to be undertaken with the Department of Health. My Department has agreed to this review which will be undertaken in advance of the commencement of the recruitment process for the July 2022 intake this autumn.</p></reply>

Aggregated data for January 2021 shows  87% compliance with the average working week of 48 hours (averaged over the roster period) and 98% compliance with the maximum 24 hour shift agreed with the IMO.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that COVID has created difficulties in relation to extended working hours for NCHDs and other staff from time to time and that particular individual experiences would not be reflected in the national returns circulated by the HSE to stakeholders, including the Department. However, these returns include data in respect of each NCHD cohort, Interns, SHO's, Registrars and Senior/Specialist Registrars and for each acute hospital. Particular sites that have lesser levels of compliance can be identified and corrective action taken. It is also noted that the HSE has continued to increase the NCHD workforce over the past 12 months and this supports compliance. Between end March 2020 and end March 2020 overall numbers increased significantly from 6,757 to 7,444 (wte's). Within this figure Intern numbers increased from 724 to 967 as part of the response to the pandemic. Higher Intern numbers are now to be recruited on an ongoing basis to support future workforce planning requirements. This should impact positively on the working hours of all Interns.</p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.  </p>  <p>  The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation. </p>  <p>  &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as to address waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Since January 2021, the NTPF has been working closely with public hospitals to arrange treatment for clinically suitable long-waiting patients on hospital outpatient and inpatient/day case waiting lists. Year to date at the end of March 2021, the NTPF had arranged 6,951 Outpatient appointments, of which 1,971 were Orthopaedic appointments. During the same period, 5,877 patients on the Inpatient/Day Case waiting lists had accepted offers of treatment funded by the NTPF, of which 1,221 were for Orthopaedic procedures. </p>  <p>  More specifically, the NTPF has advised that 587 Orthopaedic Inpatient /Day Case procedures have been approved at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh through NTPF insourcing initiatives. </p>  <p>  In terms of paediatric waiting times, in recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI.  </p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post-operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018. </p>  <p>  A number of clinically suitable patients from Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland currently undergo orthopaedic procedures at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland and the HSE are exploring initiatives to treat additional paediatric orthopaedic patients at Cappagh Hospital. </p>  <p>  With regard to the particular query raised in relation to additional capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The scheme provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and their gross pay.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has also been available to self-employed aquaculture farmers whose trading income has ceased or reduced to &euro;960 over a rolling 8-week period, or aquaculture employees laid off because of the Pandemic. These measures continue to be available to all sectors of our economy at very considerable cost.</p>  <p>  My Department implemented a Covid-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme in the second half of 2020 under its European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme. This scheme was designed to address the needs for support identified by the IFA, specifically for the shellfish farming sector. The Scheme was open to rope mussel and oyster producers and provided a fixed payment based on enterprise size (in terms of historic production levels).</p>  <p>  Payments were calculated to compensate for lost sales arising from the Pandemic over the period February to June 2020 and ranged from &euro;1,300 for the smallest rope mussel producers to &euro;9,000 for the largest, while for oyster producers who have higher costs of production, payments ranged from &euro;6,800 for the smallest producers to &euro;16,300 for the largest. Some 152 aquaculture enterprises benefitted from the scheme at a cost of &euro;1.2 million, with a further 4 applications under consideration within BIM. The Scheme was well received by the IFA and the aquaculture sector.</p></reply>

For example, in May 2020, the Mexican market was opened for raw frozen pigmeat; which was the successful culmination of engagement with internal and external stakeholders over several years. Priority markets are agreed with Industry each year and quarterly meeting are held to update against these priorities.</p><p>The success of our pigmeat market access is reflected in the CSO trade statistics which show that Ireland exports pigmeat to some 60 countries with the top five destinations of the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Denmark and Germany. Cumulatively, these five destinations accounted for some 80% of pigmeat exports in volume terms in 2020. The value of pigmeat exports have also increased by almost 12% since 2017 with volumes remaining largely stable and averaging 278.000 tonnes annually over the same period.</p><p>My Department continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders. My colleague Minister of State Martin Heydon T.D. chaired the newly established pig roundtable which held its inaugural meeting on 28 April. The aim of the roundtable is to facilitate and encourage constructive stakeholder engagement in progressing the development of the sector.

The specialist company involved in the research had originally intended to bring in two veterinarians from South America, both highly experienced in performing procedures around harvesting oocytes (&lsquo;eggs&rsquo;) from live donor female cattle and embryo transfers. One of the two veterinarians who came to Ireland, the other was unable to travel.  </p>  <p>  All experimental procedures were approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is the competent authority in Ireland responsible for the implementation of European Union legislation (Directive 2010/63/EU) for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Scientific Animal Protection ). The  veterinarian currently in Ireland was authorised to work on the research project by HPRA. </p>  <p>  The embryo transfer work that the second Veterinarian was scheduled to undertake is now being carried out by individuals approved to carry out such duties on a commercial basis here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Regarding the veterinarian currently in Ireland , his travel was subject to Department of Justice working visa requirements and Department of Health COVID-19 guidelines.</p></reply>
