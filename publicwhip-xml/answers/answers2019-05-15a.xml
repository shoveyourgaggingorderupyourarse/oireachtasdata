Across the country, 40 additional OTs will be recruited by the end of the year, and there will be a focus on addressing those cases where people have been waiting over 52 weeks.  In total, HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan estimates that over 350,000 primary care occupational therapy patients will be seen in 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, local HSE management continue to endeavour to provide the highest quality service and to prioritise referrals based on clinical need. In 2018 and early 2019, management in CHO 8 developed waiting list initiatives that were targeted at those waiting longest for OT services. As a result of this, there was decrease of 400 in the number of the longest waiting clients in Laois and Offaly, a reduction of 35%. </p>  <p>  Further efforts to tackle access times and implement service improvement plans will be considered as resources permit.  Notwithstanding the HSE's current interim financial and recruitment control measures, I believe that it is essential that we continue to invest in  and develop  our primary care services and infrastructure in order to reform and modernise our health system to ensure better access to care and deliver sustainability and best value for population health.  </p></reply>

There are 10 Supported Care Homes in Community Healthcare Organisation Area 5 providing accommodation and support services to older people with low to medium dependency levels.  The residents cannot be maintained independently at home, but do not yet require nursing home care.  The HSE acknowledges the role played by these Homes in reducing possible admission to nursing homes.  The HSE will provide about &euro;2.5 million in Section 39 funding this year towards the operational costs of the Homes. I have been assured by the HSE that it is committed to ensuring Supported Care Homes are supported while recognising that there are also strengths to services for older people in other parts of the country which also assist in  reducing unnecessary admissions to nursing homes. </p>  <p>  As people get older, their housing needs may change.  The Government recently launched a Policy Statement &ldquo;Housing Options for our Ageing Population&rdquo; which provides a policy framework to support our ageing population through increasing the accommodation options available to them and give them meaningful choice in how and where they choose to live. It also sets out a package of key actions that will assist the development of models of supported housing that promote integration between housing and health and social care services.    </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental and Inter-Agency Implementation Group, with an independent Chair is being established to progress the programme of actions contained in the policy statement. This will assist in developing a menu of solutions which are available nationally to provide enhanced housing and support options for older people.</p></reply>

The reason for this revised schedule was that the project had to be re-tendered as there was no successful outcome from the initial tender process which was undertaken early in 2018. In addition, the scope of the report has been revisited to incorporate interim priority infrastructural requirements.</p></reply>

Planning for Winter 2019/20 has already commenced, with a review of performance over the Winter Period currently underway to ensure that the lessons learned from this year inform future plans. </p>  <p>  With regard to Mayo University Hospital, for the first quarter of 2019, in comparison to 2018, the number of patients attending the Emergency Department increased by 2.3% and the number of patients admitted decreased by 2.9%. The number of patients recorded on trolleys at 8am reduced by 4.2%. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the improved trolley performance did not continue into April and provisional TrolleyGAR data highlights that the number of patients waiting on trolleys in Mayo University Hospital increased from 145 in 2018 to 359 in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Data in relation to attendance and admissions for April is not available at this time. However, the HSE has advised that hospitals are reporting very high levels of demand, high patient acuity and high bed occupancy, especially in the over 75-year old cohort of patients. In addition, delayed discharges are above the expected activity threshold set out in the National Service Plan and Hospitals and Community Health Organisations are reporting constrained options for supported discharges, particularly in relation to home support and long-term care. </p>  <p>  Building upon the actions in the Winter Plan, and to meet the ongoing operational challenges, robust planning arrangements were put in place for the Easter and May bank holiday weekends by Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations, and efforts are continuing to build upon the improved performance achieved nationally and in Mayo University Hospital in the first three months of the year.</p></reply>

We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.</p><p>Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. Since this Government took up office, the budget for Disability Services has increased by &euro;314 million. This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its Disability Services Programme.</p><p>My primary concern is to ensure the continuity of appropriate person-centred disability services is maintained and delivered in an equitable manner consistent with the care and support needs of individuals. I want to acknowledge the important services provided by Rehab and the commitment of the staff of Rehab to people with a disability and their families.</p><p>I am informed by the HSE that the total revenue allocation provided by the HSE to Rehab for social services has increased by &euro;8.1 million to &euro;56.1 million in 2019 when compared with the allocation in 2016.</p><p>Rehab provides a range of services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism, or acquired brain injury.

The model is fully aligned with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare and proposes a hub and spoke model, with services provided as close to home as possible but with access to specialist services where required.</p>  <p>  The roles performed by Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Nurse Specialists include identifying the patient&rsquo;s needs and coordinating their care; monitoring symptoms; helping with drug management; and providing emotional and lifestyle support.   </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that there are currently 2 Advanced Nurse Practitioners in Neurology and 5 Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Nurse Specialists employed by the public health service.</p>  <p>  Investment in treatment for Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease is ongoing. In 2018, funding was allocated to the Mater Hospital to commence the service to care for Deep Brain Stimulation which is a surgical procedure aimed at providing relief of motor function symptoms that are no longer controlled by drug therapy. The funded posts include two Clinical Nurse Specialists. </p>  <p>   The HSE has further advised that, under the model of care for neurology, it is intended that multidisciplinary services will be provided to Parkinson's Disease patients using an outreach model.  Specialist nurses will be centrally involved in integrating these services.</p></reply>

In 2013 Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan was included in the list of designated Model 2 Hospitals under the Smaller Hospitals Framework. Every hospital in the Group, large and small, has a vital role to play within the Group, with smaller hospitals, such as Navan Hospital, managing routine, urgent or planned care locally and more complex care managed in the larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of re-design work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan Hospital within the Group and to ensure that it will provide more services safely and appropriately with better linkages to primary, continuing and social care. </p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans to change Emergency Department services at Navan. Ireland East Hospital Group has been developing an Implementation Plan for future service configuration at Navan Hospital.  Proposed changes to any Emergency Department service will only take place in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group and will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the Hospital Group will continue to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed. </p></reply>

Improving timely access for patients to scheduled and unscheduled care is at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Building upon the process made in recent years in this area, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 published by my Department, includes a specific workstream on Access and Waiting Lists. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in the Action Plan and in Sl&aacute;intecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Progress has already been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan Waiting List and Access actions this year. </p>  <p>  In March, I published the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019. The plan includes a target to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list for hospital operations and procedures to 60,000 by year end.  It is worth recalling that the number of patients waiting was 86,000 in July 2017 and significant progress has been made over the past two years.</p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) who, following an increase in funding in Budget 2019 to &euro;75 million, will supply additionality to HSE activity in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  </p>  <p>  With regard to unscheduled care, the Winter Plan 2018/19 was designed to ensure that the Health system was well prepared, within existing financial and capacity requirements, to meet the increased demand for services over the Winter period. In Q1 2019 the overall number of patients attending Emergency Departments increased by 8%, admissions increased by 5%, however, trolleys reduced by 12%. The 8am trolley count, while still too high at just under 29,000 in Q1 2019, was the lowest level recorded in five years.  Work has commenced on preparations for Winter 2019/20.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review published last year, highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity in both hospital and community.  Progress has also been on the increasing capacity and the average number of open inpatient beds has increased by 3% between 2017 and Q1 2019 to 10,969 and further investment is scheduled in 2019 and 2020. </p></reply>

This can lead to a protracted deliberation process, where suppliers commence the negotiation process with a pricing proposal that does not reflect affordability or the evaluation of clinical effectiveness. </p>  <p>  In the case of Spinraza, following detailed consideration of an application for reimbursement and lengthy engagement with the company, the HSE decided that it was unable to reimburse Nusinersen (Spinraza). The HSE concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness was still quite limited and that the price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  On 21 February 2019, the HSE wrote to the manufacturer involved and informed them of the proposal to refuse reimbursement at the current price offering. Under the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 the company had 28 days to respond or make representations to the HSE&rsquo;s proposed decision. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the manufacturer submitted additional information and that the matter remains under consideration by the HSE. </p></reply>

Resources are now utilised across a region, so that if demand increases in one area, other resources from outside the immediate area can provide cover as required.  In line with this practice, and using the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System to triage calls, the National Ambulance Service stations in Wicklow Town, Arklow and Baltinglass, together with the Rapid Response Vehicle based in Newcastle, are supported by other ambulance bases from outside the county, including from Loughlinstown, Gorey, Naas and Athy. </p>  <p>  The Capacity Review, published in 2016, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  The Review identified particular difficulties serving rural areas such as County Wicklow.  The Capacity Review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary Community First Responder schemes.  The National Ambulance Service continues to work with local Community First Responder groups across the county to enhance services, with 23 Community First Responder groups currently operating in County Wicklow. </p>  <p>  Investment in ambulance services is guided by the Capacity Review.  This year the National Ambulance Service budget has increased to an unprecedented &euro;168.6m.  This will support the National Ambulance Service to continue to deliver a high-quality service across Ireland, including County Wicklow.  </p></reply>

The Report identified around 4000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.

However, the HSE has advised that hospitals are reporting very high levels of demand, high patient acuity and high bed occupancy, especially in the over 75-year-old cohort of patients. In addition, delayed discharges are above the expected activity threshold set out in the National Service Plan and Hospitals and Community Health Organisations are reporting constrained options for supported discharges, particularly in relation to home support and long-term care.</p>  <p>  Building upon the actions in the Winter Plan, and to meet the ongoing operational challenges, robust planning arrangements were put in place for the Easter and May bank holiday weekends by Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations, and efforts are continuing to build upon the improved performance achieved nationally and in Galway University Hospital in the first three months of the year.</p></reply>

However, as part of the National Contract for Consultants negotiated in 2008, some consultants holding specific contracts are entitled to engage in private outpatient practice outside of their public commitment and this commitment must be conducted on site, that is, in the hospital they are contracted with. As a result, private outpatient clinics may be held on the public hospital campus but these clinics must be held outside contracted hours.  The new children's hospital is obliged to provide such facilities for consultants holding such contracts.  The proposal is for consultants to pay a fee for use of the rooms and other operational costs.  </p><p>Within the plan for the hospital, an area has been planned which carries the designation of &quot;private clinic&quot;. Within the &lsquo;private clinic&rsquo; area the following has been drawn:</p><p>- 1 x reception desk area x 7m2</p><p>- 1 x feeding room x 4m2</p><p>- 1 x wait area x 16m2</p><p>- 1 x play area x 8m</p><p>- 8 x consult/examination rooms x 16m2</p><p>- 1 x WC x 3m2</p><p>- 1 x clean utility x 9m2</p><p>- 1 x dirty utility x 7m2</p><p>Total area: 180m2 </p><p>This work is planned to proceed at the building commissioning stage in the year before the building opens. </p></reply>

The Psychiatric Nurses Association state that their industrial action is in connection with two substantive issues. The first is the automated deduction of union subscriptions. The second is the refusal by the HSE to engage in negotiations with the PNA or to recognise the PNA as representing ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  To be clear, NASRA, which is affiliated with the PNA, is a group which is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights. The PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of a number of unions. These are SIPTU, FORSA and UNITE. The deduction of subscriptions is not a legal right but rather a concession granted to recognised unions. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken this industrial action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  Officials from the Department have met with representatives of the HSE and the management of National Ambulance Service to explore possible options. However, this is a complex, challenging situation. </p>  <p>  Industrial relations policy has had a long standing objective of avoiding fragmentation in worker representation in public sector employments, and the trade union movement generally, so as to facilitate the orderly conduct of bargaining and other aspects of industrial relations.</p></reply>

The Health budget was increased by &euro;848 million on 2018, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the HSE, which considers both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with agencies across Government. All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il. </p><p>The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally. Despite welcome increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and ageing populations are major challenges to health funding internationally. The additional funding secured over recent years provides a<b></b>substantial basis for the Health Service to maximise the level and quality of service delivery while also implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p><p>The costs associated with these service pressures and strategic change will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base in 2019 and beyond.  The HSE has my full support in achieving these improvements as part of our shared reform agenda.</p><p>The services to be provided in 2019 are as set out in the National Service Plan, and levels are typically equal to or higher than planned or delivered in 2018. The additional funding provided in Budget 2019 for new developments will support new or expanded levels of services across priority service areas.</p></reply>

Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year. </p><p>This year the HSE intends to provide 17.9 million home support hours<b></b>to 53,000 people and intensive home care packages to 235 people.  </p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.  Preliminary data indicates that at the end of March there were 52,360 people in receipt of home support.  During the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.  </p><p>I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like. However, the HSE has assured my Department that those people who are on a waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate.</p><p>While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  We are developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services.  This will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the new scheme in 2021.</p><p>In the meantime, the Department and the HSE are continuing to improve existing services, including in 2018 the introduction of a single funding stream for home support services.  This is providing significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p></reply>

Planning for Winter 2019/20 has already commenced, with a review of performance over the Winter Period currently underway to ensure that the lessons learned from this year inform future plans.</p>  <p>  With regard to Naas General Hospital, for the first quarter of 2019, in comparison to 2018, the number of patients attending the Emergency Department increased by 4.7% and the number of patients admitted increased by 19.2%. However, the number of patients recorded on trolleys at 8am reduced by 26.2%.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the improved trolley performance did not continue into April and provisional TrolleyGAR data highlights that the number of patients waiting on trolleys in Naas General Hospital increased from 439 in April 2018 to 478 in April 2019.</p>  <p>  Data in relation to attendance and admissions for April is not available at this time. However, the HSE has advised that hospitals are reporting very high levels of demand, high patient acuity and high bed occupancy, especially in the over 75-year old cohort of patients. In addition, delayed discharges are above the expected activity threshold set out in the National Service Plan and Hospitals and Community Health Organisations are reporting constrained options for supported discharges, particularly in relation to home support and long-term care.</p>  <p>  Building upon the actions in the Winter Plan, and to meet the ongoing operational challenges, robust planning arrangements were put in place for the Easter and May bank holiday weekends by Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations, and efforts are continuing to build upon the improved performance achieved nationally and in Naas General Hospital in the first three months of the year.</p></reply>

Realising the vision articulated in the Strategy requires a fundamental restructuring of maternity service delivery, as well as significant investment over the lifetime of the Strategy. This work is ongoing and considerable progress has been made to date to implement the Strategy&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  The significant funding provided to the NWIHP has helped in this regard by increasing capacity through the recruitment of additional midwives, consultants, theatre staff, ultrasonographers and Quality and Safety managers across the service. In 2016, the year the Strategy was launched, development funding of &euro;3m was provided for maternity services.  This was followed by increased funding of &euro;6.8m in 2017.  In 2018, &euro;4.15m development funding was allocated to the NWIHP to progress the Strategy.  Funding of &euro;3.1m is being made available to the NWIHP in 2019 to continue services introduced in 2018, along with an additional &euro;1m funding to further progress the Strategy. </p>  <p>  As a result of the investment in maternity services made since the launch of the Strategy, more women and their families are being offered midwifery led care, with many of our maternity hospitals and units now providing home-away-from-home suites and community-based midwifery services. Bereavement teams have been established in all maternity hospitals and units and are providing compassionate care to women and families, in line with the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. In addition, the expansion of anomaly scanning services is continuing, and 15 hospitals now offer routine scans to women, up from 7 in 2016. Other significant progress includes the design and roll out of safety frameworks, including the establishment of Serious Incident Management Teams at hospital group level, the design and trial of a Maternity Event Review Tool and the completion of Phase 1 of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System. My Department will continue to work with the NWIHP in 2019 to support the ongoing implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. </p></reply>

Improving timely access to care for patients is at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Building upon the progress made in recent years in this area, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 published by my Department, includes a specific work stream on Access and Waiting Lists. </p>  <p>  Progress has already been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan Waiting List and Access actions this year. </p>  <p>  With regard to unscheduled care, the Winter Plan 2018/19 was designed to ensure that the Health system was well prepared, within existing financial and capacity requirements, to meet the increased demand for services over the Winter period. </p>  <p>  University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country and the hospital and CHO Mid West  were identified as one of the 9  focus sites requiring additional investment, focus and support this Winter. This support included additional home support packages and transitional care beds, additional bed capacity and access to diagnostics. At local level the Hospital Group have also taken a range of additional actions and I have referred this question to the HSE for direct reply to you on these actions. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review published last year, highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity.  Progress has also been made on increasing capacity in UHL and the average number of open inpatient beds has increased by 4% between 2017 and March 2019 to 438.  Significant further investment is planned with a capital budget of &euro;19.5 million approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at UHL, with &euro;10 million of this funding allocated in 2019. Enabling works commenced in March 2019, and the HSE advise that the main works are expected to start at the end of May 2019. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in UHL and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of this project. </p>  <p>  With regard to the correspondence referenced by the Deputy, the HSE is currently undertaking a review of performance across all Hospital Groups and CHO's over the winter period. The HSE advise that this process will include an independent expert review of clinical, analytical and management capability in University Hospital Limerick and CHO Mid West and the other focus sites and CHO's. In addition, this correspondence, and related correspondence from the INMO,  raises INMO concerns regarding patient safety and other matters at University Hospital Limerick and my Department has requested the HSE to consider the  issues raised and revert as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

The HSE concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness was still quite limited and that the price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  On 21 February 2019, the HSE wrote to the manufacturer involved and informed them of the proposal to refuse reimbursement at the current price offering.

The responses to that consultation and other possible policy levers are being considered by my Department with a view to developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy statement which will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  At an operational level, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017 which is making considerable progress using a collaborative approach with hospital pharmacists and clinical teams to bring about changes in prescribing practice. In that respect, hospitals are working towards a targeted minimum prescribing rate for biosimilars of 50%.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also working on identifying barriers to the prescribing of biosimilars with a specific focus on education and support.  It is seeking to increase understanding of biosimilars through targeted presentations to clinicians and hospitals. </p>  <p>  The culmination of these initiatives is a greater uptake in the usage of biosimilars and this is evident by hospital dispensing data.  For example, the prescribing rate for the biosimilar drug Infliximab has increased from 5% in 2017 to 40% in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department proposes to build on these positive developments and to bring forward a policy statement that would support and complement the many initiatives which are already underway.</p></reply>

The term respiratory disease includes lung cancer, COPD, asthma, pneumonia, influenza, TB, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnoea amongst others.</p>  <p>  Inevitably this wide range of acute and chronic respiratory conditions impacts significantly on Ireland&rsquo;s health care system. It is one of the major health challenges of the 21st century the EU 28. A number of policies and strategies are addressing this. </p>  <p>  Healthy Ireland is a government-led initiative aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of everyone living in Ireland. Greater public awareness of signs and symptoms of respiratory disease and the importance of presenting earlier to a primary care physician are crucial for improving quality of life and outcomes and reducing impact on health services. Prevention is a key element of tackling the burden of respiratory diseases and Healthy Ireland encompasses policies that address the many lifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of respiratory disease including smoking cessation, tackling obesity and promoting exercise. </p>  <p>  Most people with respiratory disease are cared for in the community by their GP and primary care team. The recent agreement on GP contractual reforms involving my Department, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO)  is an important step towards improving care for these patients. Over 400,000 Medical Card and GP Visit Card patients with chronic illnesses, including respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD will stand to benefit from new and improved chronic disease management programmes</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in tackling acute and chronic respiratory diseases through the HSE National Clinical Programmes including the development of models of care, adapting national guidelines, improving integrated care and supporting patient self-care.  A recent review of the HSE National Clinical Programmes completed by the Office of Chief Clinical Officer in the HSE has recommended the amalgamation of a number of respiratory disease clinical programmes under one Respiratory National Clinical Programme. </p>  <p>  Successive National Cancer Control Strategies over the last 20 years have supported health service providers to prevent cancer, treat cancer, and increase survival and quality of life for those who develop cancer, by converting the knowledge gained through research, surveillance and outcome evaluation into strategies and actions. Specifically the National Cancer Control Programme has published a NCEC endorsed clinical guideline on lung cancer. There are also eight rapid access lung cancer clinics located in each of the Cancer Centres in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The reform of our health services, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare is the foundation upon which we will meet the challenges of management of the major chronic diseases including the burden of respiratory disease. This will include continuing to raise awareness and supporting the prevention, early detection and the development of integrated and new models of care across the full spectrum of self-management, primary care and acute hospital services. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan (2019) has specifically referenced COPD as one of its priorities.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that burden of respiratory diseases on individuals and our population as a whole is a challenge that our health service and indeed all health services across the EU will have to face but I am confident that the policies that we are pursuing will lead to significant population health improvements.  </p></reply>

Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital appointments and procedures is a key priority for Government and the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 which was published by my Department, includes a specific workstream on Access and Waiting Lists.</p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the need to invest in increased capacity while also shifting the balance of care from hospitals to community services for better health outcomes and a more sustainable health service. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in Sl&aacute;intecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  I published the joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 in March. The plan sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing wait times for hospital operations and procedures and outpatient appointments. A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. Under the plan the NTPF will use &euro;6 million to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The plan includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialties, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE, the  NTPF and my department, under the Access Plan, to work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  </p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:</p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.</p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.</p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.</p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  Concerning the documents you refer to, Officials in my Department have examined all documents that have been submitted to date for consideration and have discussed them with Defence Forces management. Having consulted with the Defence Forces, it has been determined that those papers did not produce any new material or evidence that was not already considered. If additional documentation is made available which could throw new light on the circumstances on the issue of medals, this would be greatly welcomed.  My Department stands ready to give full and careful consideration to any documents provided to it on the matter of Jadotville.</p></reply>

The Government has analysed the detail of the UK proposals and their potential impact, together with our EU partners. </p>  <p>  Any tariff regime would be extremely serious for Irish exporters, particularly for agri-food exports. That is why we have worked so hard to secure the Withdrawal Agreement that would enable both sides to negotiate a future relationship agreement with the aim of avoiding tariffs and quotas. We remain firmly of the view that ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement will enable both sides to negotiate a future relationship agreement avoiding tariffs and quotas.</p>  <p>  We welcome the decision of the April European Council to grant an extension, at the UK's request, to the Article 50 process.  </p>  <p>  However, given the ongoing political uncertainty in London, the risk of no deal has not been entirely averted.  Responsibility for avoiding a no deal scenario now lies firmly with the UK and Westminster. We hope that the ongoing cross-party talks between the UK Government and the Official Opposition will lead to a positive outcome.</p>  <p>  Our core objective continues to be to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protecting the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and safeguarding the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union. Those objectives remain constant, including in a no deal scenario. In all scenarios, as co-guarantors, the Irish and UK Governments will continue to have obligations under the Good Friday agreement to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

It reaffirms the existing CTA arrangements between Ireland and the UK and recognises the shared commitment of both to protect the associated reciprocal rights and privileges as a legitimate and fundamental public policy. The MOU further reaffirms the status that Irish and British citizens enjoy in each other&rsquo;s State, including the associated reciprocal rights and privileges. It confirms our shared intention to provide further certainty and clarity to Irish and British citizens, and to those responsible for delivering relevant services, about the associated reciprocal rights and privileges. It commits to ensuring that any necessary legislative steps are taken to give effect to the associated reciprocal rights and privileges. Oversight will be provided by a group of senior officials from each jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  As well as the East-West dimension, the CTA arrangements also underpin the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, as well as the cross-border freedoms central to the lives and livelihoods of the people of Northern Ireland and the border region.</p>  <p>  At a time when there has been uncertainty caused by the potential outcomes of Brexit, the MOU provides clarity and assurance for citizens of both countries. They do not need to take any action to protect their status and associated rights under the CTA.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that all options, including an international treaty, were carefully considered at the outset of the negotiations. In view of how the CTA has developed incrementally over the decades and of how it has proven itself robust and adaptable to evolving circumstances, Ireland and the UK both agreed that an MOU was the most appropriate vehicle to express our shared commitment to the CTA.  We arrived at the shared view that the very flexibility and durability of the arrangements would be best served by an MOU.  As well as codifying the CTA for the first time and setting out what it covers, the MOU is a very clear and solemn expression of the two Governments&rsquo; firm commitment to the maintenance of the arrangements and is a key example of continued positive British-Irish engagement and cooperation. </p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base. However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, including the State pension.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service individuals who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.</p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefitting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.</p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with public service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. It is estimated that over 750,000 income earners will not be liable to USC in 2019.</p>  <p>  In the last number of Budgets, the Government has been introducing targeted changes to the income tax system within available resources to make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, focusing on low and middle income earners.  This has been done by making targeted changes to the USC and also by increasing the entry point to the higher rate of income tax. </p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of income tax at too low a level and we are committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. It is expected that continued progress in this area will also be made in the context of limited resources available in Budget 2020, balanced against all of the competing demands.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-15a.238.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051500062#WRE00400"><p>I recognise that there has been a substantial increase in corporation tax receipts in recent years and, while in many ways this is a positive reflection of our economic recovery and improved trading conditions, I am also aware that there are risks associated with this increase.  In particular it is important to ensure that longer-term spending commitments are not entered into on the basis of a potentially short term upswing in corporate tax revenues.</p>  <p>  The recently published Revenue data in respect of Corporation Tax (CT) payments for the year 2018 show that the share of CT receipts from the top 10 companies increased to 45% in 2018.  However the report also notes that this increase was partially driven by a one-off change in accounting standards (IFRS 15) leading to additional tax receipts in 2018.  If these were excluded, the share of net receipts from the top 10 companies would have been 43%.  </p>  <p>  Revenue data show that the proportion of receipts contributed by the top ten taxpayers in any given year has been relatively stable over time &ndash; for example it has ranged between 36% and 41% over the preceding five years 2013 to 2017.  Revenue data also indicates that there is a level of &lsquo;churn&rsquo; in the top-10 payers, i.e. the composition of the top 10 taxpayer companies changes from year to year.  As Ireland has been consistently successful in attracting leading multi-nationals to base here, and given our level of integration with the global economy, this concentration is not altogether surprising. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department has, together with Revenue, highlighted this as a risk in Budget and Stability Programme Update risk statements and in the Annual Taxation Report 2018. I am also aware of the risks associated with developing a reliance on potentially cyclical upturns in receipts, and the Government has taken a number of actions to address these risks, including:</p>  <p>  - Establishing the Rainy Day Fund;</p>  <p>  - Using the 2018 revenue over-performance to run an Exchequer surplus and prioritising the reduction of debt;</p>  <p>  - Continuing to broaden the tax base; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that receipts arising from identified one-off factors are not carried forward into the tax base for future years &ndash; for this reason &euro;0.7 billion  of the 2018 over-performance was not carried forward into the 2019 tax base on foot of the advice of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal for an assessment of the sustainability of corporation tax receipts, forecasts are inherently subjective and often rely on reference to long-term averages as a component factor.  In the case of corporation tax, this subjectivity would be further compounded by the ongoing process of international tax reform.  Implementation of the agreed BEPS Actions is under way and further work has commenced at the OECD to agree further changes at a global level that address the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation of the economy.  This work is at a relatively early stage and will continue over the next two years with a view to reaching consensus by the end of 2020.  </p>  <p>  I would however note that my officials are currently conducting an examination of potential policy options to mitigate against the risk of over-reliance on CT receipts and a fiscal framework to reduce reliance on CT will be published by this Department at the time of the publication of the Summer Economic Statement, 2019.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it should also be noted that a tax forecasting methodology group has been established and is currently undertaking work to review the existing tax forecasting methodology with a focus on the four largest tax heads (excise duties, income tax, corporation tax and VAT). Where appropriate, this work will make recommendations for changes to the tax forecast methodology.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the work already under way within my Department, and the other considerations referred to in this answer, I do not intend to establish a separate review of the nature suggested by the Deputy. </p></reply>

As of March 2019 there were &euro;175 million of mortgages outstanding across the sector.</p><p>The amount of mortgage lending Credit Unions can engage in, however, is limited by the Central Bank&rsquo;s lending regulations for Credit Unions which allow only a certain proportion of a Credit Union&rsquo;s loans to be long term loans due to lending maturity limits. </p><p>These lending regulations have been under review since October 2018 when the Central Bank commenced a public consultation.</p><p>Reviewing these Lending Regulations is a very important matter and one for which I have previously outlined my strong support &ndash; including in a letter I wrote to Governor Lane in late 2017.</p><p>The proposed revisions to the Lending Regulations from the Central Bank contain many positive elements. The proposals change the basis of calculation for the limits from a percentage of loans to a percentage of assets, which is something that the sector has been calling for. The proposals would also allow larger and capable credit unions to do significantly more mortgage lending than is currently the case.</p><p>Based on the data supplied in the Consultation Paper, the proposals would allow in the first instance a sectoral capacity of &euro;861 million for mortgages, which should be seen in the context of the &euro;175 million of mortgages outstanding across the sector as of March 2019.</p><p>This capacity would increase if applicable Credit Unions are approved for the higher limits. In the case where all Credit Unions with assets greater than &euro;100 million were approved for the higher limit, sectoral capacity could increase to a maximum of around &euro;1.8 billion.</p><p>As I mentioned the Consultation Paper containing these proposals was published in October 2018, with the consultation period open until the 9<sup>th</sup>January of this year. This gave credit unions, their representative bodies, and other stakeholders the opportunity to analyse the proposals put forward in the Consultation Paper and engage in the consultation by submitting their views to the Central Bank.  One of the matters being consulted on is the definition of a mortgage, which the Central Bank would propose to exclude commercial or Buy-to-Let mortgages, as is the current practice.</p><p>The Central Bank is currently in the process of reviewing the submissions received and expects to publish a feedback statement and draft regulations in the second half of 2019. </p><p>Officials from my Department have liaised with the Central Bank regarding the proposals in the Consultation Paper and I will input into the statutory consultation process when it arises. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-15a.244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051500062#WRE01000"><p>Both I and the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., are very conscious of the difficulties that the cost and availability of insurance are having on many businesses and community groups in this country.  The Deputy should note that there is no policy or legislative &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; to decrease the cost of insurance.  This was also recognised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Reform, who reported on the issue in late 2016.  This is a complex issue because for constitutional reasons the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  Having said this, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase of the Group's work culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Much work has been done to date through the implementation of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries;</p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p>  <p>  - increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers;</p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, collections of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud; and,</p>  <p>  - the Courts Service has confirmed that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.</p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

The scheme will support the needs of the business, increase career development opportunities and facilitate relocation for staff members. The establishment of the scheme fulfils one of the requirements of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan; and Action 14 of the People Strategy for the Civil Service, which calls for the further expansion of a coherent mobility policy to facilitate staff development and strategic alignment with other HR policies, builds upon this.</p>  <p>  The scheme is being introduced on a phased basis as follows:</p>  <p>Phase 1A of the scheme is for the general Civil Service grades of Clerical Officer (CO) and Executive Officer (EO) to apply for mobility between and within 46 zones - excluding mobility within Zone 46 (Dublin) which will be included in Phase 1B. The application stage of this phase launched in November 2017 with c. 3,500 staff members (1 in 5 of the 17,000 participating staff members - 60% CO : 40% EO) applying for mobility and making an average of 8 organisational choices  .</p>  <p>  The location choices in the scheme are divided into mobility zones rather than county or province.  An applicant may express a preference for mobility for a maximum of 3 zones from the list of 46 zones with a choice of any or all organisations in each zone (a full list of zones and organisations per zone can be viewed at www.hr.per.gov.ie). Staff members can apply for mobility within their current zone (excluding Phase 1B, Zone 46 Dublin) as well as other zones. A number of mobility zones also have an option to include or exclude a choice of satellite towns.   </p>  <p>  The offer stage of this phase launched in September 2018.  To date over 200 moves have been accepted, and are either complete or in progress (129 COs and 76 EOs).  </p>  <p>Phase 1B (CO's and EO's - Dublin) is on track to launch in the coming months.</p>  <p>Phase 2 of the scheme will include the general Civil Service grades of Higher Executive Officer, and Assistant Principal.  Officials from my Department have commenced discussions with stakeholders on the development of this phase and it is anticipated that Phase 2 will be introduced in 2020.</p>  <p>  Principal Officer (PO) Mobility - this scheme was introduced in September 2015 as part of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan. It is designed &ldquo;to expand career and mobility opportunities for staff across geographic, organisational and sectoral boundaries.&rdquo; To date 46 PO positions have been filled through mobility and a number are currently ongoing. </p></reply>

As such, they do not reflect any transfers of functions or technical adjustments which have occurred within the period. As a result, ceilings may not be directly comparable for all Vote groups across the period. Attachment 2 sets out all of the transfers of functions that have taken place between 2014 and 2019. </p><p>A number of technical adjustments also impact on analysis of the 2014 to 2019 period. Significant among these are changes made in 2017 to funding for Irish Water. Following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, all Motor Tax receipts are paid into the Exchequer, rather than the Local Government Fund, and all State funding for domestic water services is provided through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This resulted in an increase in gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government of &euro;792 million.  This increase had no impact on overall General Government expenditure. Conversely, REV 2015 reflected the disestablishment of the HSE Vote with expenditure of the HSE now met by way of a grant from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence, certain income previously recognised as appropriations-in-aid on the HSE Vote is now retained by the HSE and is no longer reflected in gross expenditure ceilings or outturns from 2015 on. On the Defence Vote, from 2015 onwards, the purchase of military equipment was reclassified as capital expenditure rather than current expenditure. This accounts for the apparent rise in Defence capital expenditure that occurs between Budget 2015 and Budget 2016.</p></reply>

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.</p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. </p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. My Department is also aware that parents of children with complex special educational needs have difficulty in sourcing a tutor for their child.</p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes Meakstown, Charlestown and Lanesborough are located in the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next 4 years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there may be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future which can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools. </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new school for the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  </p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in Kinnegad (which is located in the Killucan school planning area), I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  As outlined, where a decision is made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  </p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken. </p><p>Accordingly, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process and thus an average wait time for applications is not a meaningful measure.  However, I can say that in general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application. Details are available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Applicants who are refused international protection have their passports returned to them at the time of refusal and persons who are granted subsidiary protection have their passports returned at the time they are granted subsidiary protection. </p>  <p>  Passports are not returned to those who have been given a refugee status declaration. It should be noted that persons granted refugee status under section 55 of the International Protection Act 2015 are entitled to a 1951 UN Convention travel document, sometimes referred to as a refugee travel document, which is used in lieu of a passport to travel from and into the State. </p>  <p>  Use by a refugee of a passport issued by her or his country of origin can be construed as continuing to avail of the protection of that country, thereby undermining the grounds on which asylum was granted, and potentially provide a basis for revocation of refugee status. It would be neither correct nor logical to create the conditions for revocation of a status and so the passport is retained. As indicated, refugees are entitled to a travel document for travel to or from the State. </p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances, a person to whom a refugee declaration, can have their passport returned on a temporary basis if there is a demonstrable and well-founded reason for such return, for example, if it is required by a State or other organisation for the purpose of identity verification as a condition of service. Persons must undertake to use them only for the purpose declared and to return them when the business for which they were required has been transacted. They are not permitted to travel on them as they are entitled to a refugee travel document for that purpose. </p>  <p>  If a person's protection declaration ceases to be in force there is no barrier to such a person from holding a passport.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-15a.342.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051500065#WRH02200"><p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that the supports provided to women in custody in the D&oacute;chas Centre who are experiencing issues with substance abuse are in accordance with the Irish Prison Service Clinical Addiction Policy.  The policy prescribes strategies which are based on best practice, and contemporary evidenced based approaches to supporting persons in custody.</p>  <p>  Women in custody in the D&oacute;chas Centre have access to a range of addiction supports, including detoxification, stabilisation, and the initiation or maintenance of Opiate Substitution Therapy (OST).  In turn, the addiction supports provided are enhanced by access to ongoing specialist addiction counsellors as part of a co-ordinated multi-disciplinary team approach.  Addiction services are co-ordinated and aligned with the individuals&rsquo; previous care in the community and post release planning in conjunction with community services is put in place prior to a persons release from custody.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service acknowledges that the provision of appropriate mental health services to those in custody is one of the major challenges to effective healthcare in prisons.  In turn, there is some evidence of an increase in the numbers of persons committed to prison who are presenting with severe and enduring mental illness.  However the level of mental health issues amongst female prisoners in Ireland is comparable to available international evidence.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that all prisoners are medically assessed on committal to prison; this includes a mental health assessment which can be employed to develop an individual care plan.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has confirmed that in-reach mental health services are made available to persons in custody through its collaboration with the Health Service Executive, and the National Forensic Mental Health Service [NFMHS].  The mental health supports provided to female prisoners in the D&oacute;chas Centre are managed by way of a multi-disciplinary approach in collaboration with the NFMHS.  Prison staff, including General Practitioners, Nurses, Psychologists, and Counsellors are supported in the delivery of those supports to prisoners by a Consultant Psychiatrist, Senior Registrar, Community Psychiatric Nurse and a Mental Health Social Worker.  Direct supports include psychosocial interventions, Dialectic Behavioural Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, medication therapies and supportive counselling. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of beds in the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) for prisoners suffering from a severe mental illness who require residential mental health treatment.  A waiting list for the admission of prisoners to the CMH is operated by the NFMHS and is reviewed on a weekly basis.  I understand that all prisoners on the waiting list have been clinically assessed by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrists from the NFMHS as requiring admission to the CMH which is a tertiary care facility.</p>  <p>  The Healthcare Team in the D&oacute;chas Centre collaborates with the Irish Prison Psychology Service to provide appropriate care for those in custody in the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Psychology Service in the D&oacute;chas Centre provides therapeutic interventions, both in a group and on an individual basis, to support women in custody in relation to their mental health.  This Service is provided as part of a multidisciplinary team which includes Addiction Counsellors, Psychiatry, the Probation Service and Primary Care clinicians.  </p>  <p>  Women in custody who engage with the Psychology Service present with a high level of complexity and service need.  However, the needs of the person are identified through individual assessment, and appropriate interventions can then be provided.</p>  <p>  The Psychology Service in D&oacute;chas Centre has regular contact with community mental health agencies where appropriate, as well as the families and carers of those in custody.  Where clinically appropriate, Irish Prison Service Psychologists may provide time-limited community intervention(s) to support the transition of clients from custody to community.</p></reply>

This approach is aligned with the divisional-focused Garda model. It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) specifically called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation. An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard.</p>  <p>  While the Commissioner has indicated that he does not support industry funding of Garda units, he is open to considering other industry-funded proposals to combat insurance fraud, for example, IT projects and/or the appointment of analysts. My Department is currently engaging with AGS to this end, exploring these options and any other potential avenues for cooperation with the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  On a wider level, much constructive engagement has taken place, including the commitment by AGS and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  In relation to the scale of insurance claim fraud reported to AGS, the most recent figures available to the Department show that, in the period 1 October 2018 to 28 February 2019, 22 incidents of &lsquo;insurance claim fraud&rsquo; were recorded on PULSE. Please note that this data is correct as at 4 March 2019, however it is operational and therefore subject to change.</p>  <p>  I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to AGS&rsquo;s Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality. Last month, the GNECB, supported by Lucan Garda Station, CAB and the Armed Support Units, carried out searches in the west Dublin area with a view to submitting files to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Operation Coatee was successful in making a number of important seizures including documentation and financial records.</p></reply>

These include student and employment type permissions and various schemes facilitating family settlement including non-EEA national family members of Irish nationals and EU nationals.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, requests for changes in conditions of residence relate to a broad range of permission categories and modes of application.  In light of this, the information requested by the Deputy in relation to average processing times is not readily available and would involve a disproportionate use of resources to compile.  </p>  <p>  I am however advised that, in general, the average processing time varies depending on the application type.  For example, it is open to certain applicants to attend at their local Immigration Office for the appropriate permission to reside or to request a change in the type of immigration permission held.  I understand that the majority of such cases are processed on the day of application or within in a very short timeframe depending on the availability of appointments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that INIS also deals with complex cases involving detailed assessment of the individual circumstances and compliance with relevant scheme criteria and various legal requirements. While every effort is made to process such written or on-line applications efficiently, processing times may vary having regard to the overall volume of applications and their complexity.  I am advised that some cases may take in excess of 12 months to complete.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the key priorities for INIS include making the application process as streamlined as possible and delivering sound decisions to applicants under each scheme. The resources available for these activities, which includes the provision of overtime where appropriate, and the accompanying operational and organisational structures, are kept under ongoing review to ensure that applications are processed as efficiently as possible.</p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  </p>  <p>  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil. </p>  <p>  As such, the Regulations make specific provision for particular categories of applicants who may be on a reduced level of income and there is no information available to either myself or Departmental officials that in general, the level of fees is discouraging people from applying for naturalisation.  In that regard, it should be noted that once a grant of naturalisation is made in respect of non-EEA nationals, they are no longer required to register their immigration permission or pay the registration fee of &euro;300 each time. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities, or based on length of residency.  </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  </p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p><p>In relation to the Garda estate, the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by significant Exchequer funding across the Garda and OPW Votes.  In addition to that programme, other major works to the Garda estate which are ongoing include the pilot Garda station reopening project, the development of a new facility at Military Road and the major refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street station. </p><p>I would emphasise that the clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff, as well as the public interacting with them.  And there has been some good progress in relation to the Garda estate in recent times, including in particular the completion and entry into operational use in 2018 of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters in Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street (Dublin), which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of Garda stations in Cork are included in these planned or ongoing works.</p><p>First, the development of a new station in Glanmire, which will be located in Glanmire Industrial Estate, is included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme. The construction of this station is ongoing and the Garda authorities and the OPW advise that completion is expected in Q3, 2019. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in order to facilitate the Divisional Policing Model in Cork City, the Cork City Divisional Roads Policing Unit is relocating from Anglesea Street to Ballincollig Garda Station, and that works to accommodate the Divisional Roads Policing Unit in Ballincollig Garda Station are scheduled for this year.</p><p>A new station in Macroom is also included in the programme, with delivery of that station along with new stations in Clonmel and Sligo, as well as a new custody suite at the station on Anglesea Street Cork, to be achieved as part of a Public Private Partnership (PPP)<b></b>arrangement.

However I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p><p>A station in Cork is also included in the pilot station reopening project.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Ballinspittle Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Donard, Co. Wicklow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.</p><p>The OPW and Garda authorities are cooperating closely on delivery of these stations. In relation to Ballinspittle, I am informed the OPW has undertaken technical surveys to determine the works required to enable the Garda Station at Ballinspittle to reopen and is currently preparing tender documents to procure the required works. It is envisaged that works will be completed and this year.</p><p>Finally and more generally, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to address minor maintenance issues and refurbishment works across all Divisions as they arise, liaising closely with the OPW and having regard to overall Garda accommodation priorities.</p></reply>

PwC conducted this review. </p>  <p>  The review Report, "New Children's Hospital Independent Review of escalation in costs", was published on 9 April 2019.  The Report found that the Definitive Business Case which was completed by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board did not adhere to the requirements defined in the Public Spending Code. The Report did not find that the guidelines were ignored but instead identified specific issues including the Business Case treatment of tendered costs, residual risk relating to quantities and optimism bias.  </p>  <p>  The PwC Report breaks down the cost escalation as between underestimation (by far the largest contributory factor), execution issues including delays in concluding the GMP process, consequential costs (e.g. VAT) and uncontrollable costs. </p>  <p>  The Report also recommends more generally that the rules governing public sector spending on major capital projects should be strengthened.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has already advised the Oireachtas of the work underway in his Department to revise the Public Spending Code.  Finalisation of this Code will be informed by the PwC Report including the incorporation of further guidance as to how costs should be estimated, risk assessed and quantified and account taken of potential optimism bias. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are to revert to Government with a plan for implementing the PwC recommendations, and I expect that we will do so shortly.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society. The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.  </p><p>The inaugural Positive Ageing stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. The second annual stakeholder forum took place in the Department of Health in October 2018. Again, stakeholder identified clear priorities and collaborative work in this area is ongoing.</p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) was established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies. HaPAI provides an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on positive ageing and implement the research objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS).  It was jointly funded by the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme, and the Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>The initiative aims to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the NPAS. This is done primarily through the development of national positive ageing indicators which will be published at suitable intervals. The indicators report will allow all Departments to identify areas of improvement in relation to older persons' health and well-being, as well as areas requiring improvement and potential for evidence-based policy intervention.  </p><p>Home support is an important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals. Improving access to home support is a priority for Government.  Over the past four years the Government has overseen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year. This year the HSE intend to provide over 18 million home support hours<b></b>to be delivered this year to over 53,000 people.  </p><p>The Department of Health is also currently engaged in the development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-support services. In preparation for the development of the statutory scheme, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out a review of the home-care systems in four European countries. In addition, the Department conducted a public consultation on home-care services, on which a report was published in 2018. These reports are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and will help to ensure that the new scheme is informed both by international experience and by the views of stakeholders, including service-users.</p><p>Work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. The Department&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the statutory scheme in 2021. In 2019 work will focus on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation and a review of existing services. Further consultation will also be undertaken in 2019 (with key stakeholders and service-users) and will continue throughout the process of developing the new scheme.</p><p>The development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-support services is a complex process. Accordingly, it will be early 2020 before it is possible to set out in principle the parameters of the scheme and to seek Government approval to proceed to draft the heads of a bill. </p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is the policy responsibility of the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality. The 2015 Act provides for the establishment of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission to support decision-making by and for adults with capacity difficulties and to regulate individuals who are providing support to people with capacity difficulties.  A Steering Group chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality meets monthly to progress the establishment of the DSS.  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  </p><p>The Department of Health has policy responsibility for Part 8 of the 2015 Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives (AHDs). An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. </p><p>Section 91 of the Act relates to the development of a code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions. On 17 October 2016 the Minister for Health established a multidisciplinary working group to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS), in relation to the code of practice under section 91(2) of the Act. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 in December 2018 [S.I. No. 527 of 2018]. This will enable the Director of the DSS to progress the preparation of the code of practice on the AHD provisions, based on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, and in accordance with the specific process outlined in the Act. The multidisciplinary working group submitted its recommendations on the code of practice to the Director of the DSS on in December 2018. </p><p>Once completed the final code of practice can be published by the Director with the Minister's consent. The development of the code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions is a key piece of work in facilitating the subsequent commencement of Part 8 in its entirety. </p><p>Elder abuse (in a health sector context) is among the topics which will be covered in a new national policy on adult safeguarding in the health sector, currently being developed by the Department of Health following a Government decision in December 2017. It is intended that the policy will apply across the full spectrum of the Irish health and social care sector i.e. all public, voluntary and private health and social care services. A draft policy (which the Department aims to finalise around the end of 2019) will be the subject of a public consultation exercise. As the policy development process progresses, legislative requirements will also be identified. It is intended that following completion of the Adult Safeguarding policy for the health sector, any underpinning legislation required to give full effect to the policy will be pursued as appropriate. </p><p>Other recommendations included in the Report of the Assembly including those relating to taxation, retirement age and pensions do not fall within the remit of the Department of Health.</p></reply>

The Health budget was increased by &euro;848 million on 2018, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the HSE, which considers both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with agencies across Government. All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il.  </p>  <p>  In that context, the HSE needs to ensure that affordable and appropriate recruitment decisions are made. Where individual Hospital Groups or CHOs have not demonstrated their ability to do this, the HSE has introduced certain interim measures and controls across these locations. </p>  <p>  The intention is for these measures to be in place for a short period of time. The over-riding requirement for the HSE is to prioritise the delivery of safe services within the available resources. However, I have been very clear that those locations which provide credible, balanced plans will be supported. Similarly, locations which do not submit such plans need to be scrutinised.</p>  <p>  The services to be provided in 2019 are as set out in the National Service Plan, and levels are typically equal to or higher than planned or delivered in 2018. The additional funding provided in Budget 2019 for new developments will support new or expanded levels of services across priority service areas.</p></reply>

Preliminary data indicates that at the end of March there were 52,360 people in receipt of home support.  During the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.  </p><p>I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like. However, the HSE has assured my Department that those people who are on a waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate. </p><p>While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  We are developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services.  This will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the new scheme in 2021.</p><p>In the meantime, the Department and the HSE are continuing to improve existing services, including in 2018 the introduction of a single funding stream for home support services.  This is providing significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p></reply>

The Medical Council reviews the doctor&rsquo;s qualifications to ascertain which division on the register the doctor may be registered on as set out in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure a doctor they are hiring is registered on the correct division of the Medical Council Register for the role they are applying for. The Medical Council has no role in employing doctors. </p><p>When applying for registration a doctor must make a number of declarations, including whether or not they have been subject to disciplinary procedures such as Fitness to Practise or have a criminal conviction in another jurisdiction. The Medical Council is also part of the IMI (Internal Market Information)<b></b>system which means that when a practitioner is sanctioned (including erasure/cancellation) in other EU jurisdictions the Medical Council will receive an alert. If a practitioner is the subject of a notice from an IMI alert is also on the Medical Council's register the Council may decide to take its own disciplinary action. If the Council has strong concerns about a practitioner the Council may use Section 60 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to apply to the High Court to seek an emergency suspension of a practitioner&rsquo;s registration in order to protect the public, pending the outcome of the disciplinary process as per the Act.</p><p>The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 provides a statutory basis for the vetting of persons carrying out &ldquo;relevant work with children or vulnerable persons&rdquo;.  </p><p>Garda vetting is an integral part of the HSE recruitment and selection process for positions which constitute &ldquo;relevant work&rdquo; and the onus is on the management of a service to determine if a vetting disclosure is required.</p><p>General practitioners are not employees of the HSE they are private contractors providing services under contract on behalf of the HSE.

Once that report is received in the Department, I will give further consideration to the requests made by the forum that the Deputy refers to.</p>  <p>  I have been aware of the issues surrounding sodium valproate use in pregnancy since early 2017, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated its most recent review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. The risk reduction measures recommended by the EMA on foot of its previous review in 2014 were fully implemented in Ireland; prior to this, there were no specific restrictions over and above those listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet for healthcare professionals and the patient information leaflet. As with any medicine, these documents were regularly updated as new data emerged about the medicine and its potential side effects. The study referred to by the Deputy suggests that the association between valproate use in pregnancy and congenital malformations in children was firmly established by 2005. The SmPC and patient leaflets used in 2005 reflect this association, and the patient leaflet includes specific information for women who become pregnant, or could become pregnant, while taking this medicine, based on the increased risk of having a child with an abnormality.</p>  <p>  An assessment conducted by the HSE estimates that between 153 and 341 children will have experienced a major congenital malformation and up to 1,250 children will have experienced some form of neurodevelopmental delay following exposure to sodium valproate in utero between 1975 and 2015. It should be noted that this assessment was subject to a number of assumptions and limitations, and relied heavily on international data when developing estimates of the numbers of children who may be affected.</p></reply>

The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the highest standards in terms of waiting list data quality, and to promote optimal practice for the management and scheduling of patients on IDPP hospital waiting lists in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The National IDPP Waiting List Management Protocol 2017 (published on the NTPF website), was developed to provide guidance to ensure that there is a consistent and standardised approach to the management and scheduling of patients on Inpatient, Day Case and Planned Procedure waiting lists within each hospital and across hospital groups. The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the safe, timely and effective access and treatment of patients in a fair and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  The IDPP Protocol refers to reasonable notice of a scheduled To Come In (TCI) date of two weeks. In the event that a TCI date becomes available at short notice, the available slot should be offered to the next suitable patient in strict chronological order. Patients who decline this offer will not have their waiting list clock reset (or be removed from the waiting list), unless they are in receipt of a reasonable offer (two weeks&rsquo; notice).</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular issue raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  </p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p>  - Bed and board;</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.   </p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.   </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.   </p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has just published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers. </p>  <p>  This is an important development which will be of invaluable help to those entering nursing homes, nursing home providers and relatives, particularly at a time that can be stressful and difficult for families. The guidelines developed by the CCPC are an important step in improving transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers, particularly in situations where the consumer may be at increased risk of vulnerability. The Guidelines also set out requirements in relation to transparency regarding additional charges and the variation of charges. </p>  <p>  It is noted that all providers will receive a formal communication from the CCPC shortly in relation to the new guidelines. The CCPC has stated that nursing homes will be afforded a period to review their contracts and ensure that they meet the requirements of the new guidelines. </p></reply>

The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. </p>  <p>  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:</p>  <p>  - detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 outpatient first appointments.</p>  <p>  - Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;</p>  <p>  - Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000 by year end.</p>  <p>  It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including cataracts, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, a key element of the 2019 Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List which remains a significant challenge. The Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000.</p>  <p>  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments and the NTPF will deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of appointments approved relate to 4 high-volume specialties, including Ophthalmology. </p>  <p>  The Scheduled Care Access Plan is a key pillar of the project plan to deliver on the Ministerial and Department&rsquo;s 2019 Priority to improve Acute Hospital Waiting Times. The governance and oversight structures to oversee NTPF and HSE performance in the delivery against the targets set out in the Plan has been expanded to include a Working Group whose remit is to develop initiatives aimed at improving access for patients to scheduled care in a number of high volume specialties including Ophthalmology.</p>  <p>  At the end of July 2017, there were 10,024 people waiting for a cataract procedure.  Cataracts were one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF under the Inpatient Day Case Access Plan 2018 and by the end December 2018, the numbers waiting had fallen to 6,440, a reduction of 36%. There were 6151 patients waiting for a Cataract procedure at the end of April 2019, with 582 of those waiting over 9 months. This represents a reduction of 3,789 or 87% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract operation.</p></reply>

In light of this, the HSE decided to introduce interim control measures for a consolidation period of three months to the end of June, until they received clarity on plans and financial performance for Q1 2019 from Hospital Groups and CHOs. </p>  <p>  I have been very clear that those locations which provide credible, balanced plans will be supported.

There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department and all are now in their late 50s. </p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 01 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments. The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump sum and the monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations, and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services. There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive to act as a liaison with regard to the ongoing health and personal social service needs of Irish survivors.   </p>  <p>  The Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013, it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide, will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors, outlined above.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide on a statutory basis for health and personal social services for the Irish survivors of thalidomide. </p></reply>

A patient's Irish based consultant is responsible for referring the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS, after having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within Ireland. The HSE provides information for patients on the TAS on its website. </p>  <p>  An alternative where the treatment is available in Ireland is the Cross Border Directive (CBD), which the HSE operates in Ireland. Under the terms of the CBD patients in Ireland can be reimbursed for medical treatment, that is available in the public health service in Ireland, but received in another EU\EEA Member State. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the other Member State they choose to receive the service in. The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser. </p>  <p>  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. The HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the operation of the CBD. </p>  <p>  The patient should contact the HSE TAS/CBD office for advice on making an application for treatment abroad under the most appropriate scheme. They can be contacted in writing at HSE TAS/CBD Office, St Canices, Laken, Dublin Road, Kilkenny, R95 P231 or by phone on 056 778 4551.  Information is also available on the HSE's TAS and CBD websites. </p></reply>

The review acknowledged the demographic challenge facing the Irish health service in the near future due to our growing population, with our over 65 population set to increase by nearly 60% and the over 85 population set to double. These latter two groups are high users of health servicers and it is important that we invest in order to provide safe and timely care to the whole population.</p>  <p>  It is also clear we should not plan investments in the health service as it is currently configured. Investment and reform should go hand in hand with each driving the other. The Capacity Review acknowledged the need for reform of the health service and provided projections based on reform scenarios that align with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and reform programme.</p>  <p>  Arising from the findings of the Capacity Review, the Government committed to investing in an extra 2,600 beds in our hospitals and 4,500 more community beds in the National Development Plan over the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  These increases have already started. Since 2017, an additional 241 beds have been opened. The Capacity Programme for 2019 provides for the following increases to capacity, as set out in the National Service Plan 2019:</p>  <p>  - 78 additional beds, including a 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital, and a 30-bed ward in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda;</p>  <p>  - 75 acute beds and 70 community beds as part of the Winter Plan, of which 60 acute beds and 19 community beds have already opened;</p>  <p>  - preparation of 202 beds by quarter 4 2019 with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020;</p>  <p>  - preparation of the proposed opening of a 60-bed modular build in University Hospital Limerick.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.</p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures, including angiograms and hip and knee replacements. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p><p>The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Figures (April 2019), show that there were 10,099 patients on the orthopaedic inpatient and daycase waiting list. This represents a decrease of 12% on the same period last year when there were 11,483 patients waiting. Of the total number of patients waiting, 76% (7,702) are waiting 9 months or less, equating to an 8.5% (-722) decrease when compared to the same period last year. Those waiting over 9 months for an orthopaedic procedure has fallen from 3,059 to 2,397, a reduction of over 21%.</p><p>As of the end of April 2019, there were 3,788 patients on the Cardiology IPDC waiting list. This represents a decrease of nearly 6% on the same period last year when there were 4,023 patients waiting. Of the total number of patients waiting, 85% (3,221) are waiting 9 months or less, equating to a 4% (-123) decrease when compared to the same period last year. Those waiting over 9 months for a Cardiology procedure has fallen from 679 to 567, a reduction of over 16%.</p><p>More broadly, my Department has placed a particular priority on performance improvement in scheduled and unscheduled care in order to improve access for patients.

Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on the sector, given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% (&euro;5.2 billion) of agri-food exports last year.    </p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties which would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.   </p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector.  I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agri-food and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.     </p>  <p>  Obviously, as Minister, I have no role when it comes to prices paid to producers but it is important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a period of depressed prices since last autumn with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.  I also note that prices have started to increase week-on-week recently mainly due to tightening supply of cattle and the outlook is that this will continue.  Market intelligence also points towards other factors such as the presence of African Swine Fever in China affecting their pork output, thereby strengthening the demand for beef in a market to which Ireland already has access.   </p>  <p>  In light of the on-going market disturbance, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.   </p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.   </p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019.   </p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.

With regard to posters, the primary purpose of the Acts is to reduce litter by prescribing periods for which public meeting and election posters may be displayed. Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering, including oversight of the removal of posters and cable ties within the statutory timeframe, falls under the remit of Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  A public consultation process on the control of postering for elections and referenda was engaged in by this Department in September 2008, to balance the need to provide information to the public with the management of the erection of posters. As a result of this public consultation Section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009, to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election, referendum or public meeting taking place, during which posters can be displayed. Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election, but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed. Posters erected to advertise public meetings are permissible until the advertisement has been in position for 7 days or longer after the day specified in the advertisement for the meeting. Failure to comply with this legislation is an offence.</p>  <p>I am satisfied that the above measures, as outlined above, mitigate against the potential creation of litter and I currently have no proposals to alter this position.  </p></reply>

Airlines are required to monitor, report and verify their emissions, and to surrender allowances against those emissions. Airlines receive tradeable allowances covering a certain level of emissions from their flights per year and must purchase allowances to cover any shortfall between their allocated sum of free emissions allowances and their actual emissions, as reported annually. The ETS is administered in Ireland by the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>  <p>  Reforms to the ETS, adopted at EU level in 2018, are designed to strengthen the ETS for the 2021-2030 period. These reforms are intended to provide a much stronger price signal to encourage deeper emissions reductions in sectors covered by the ETS, including aviation. </p>  <p>  To support the planned development of a global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the EU agreed in 2014 to limit the scope of aviation in the EU ETS to flights within the EEA. CORSIA will come into effect in 2021 and aims to stabilise global aviation emissions at 2020 levels by requiring airlines to offset any emissions growth after 2020 by purchasing eligible emission units generated by projects that reduce emissions in other sectors. CORSIA is the first global market-based measure for any industrial sector and is one component of ICAO&rsquo;s suite of measures in support of improving the environmental performance of international aviation. Responsibility for the implementation of CORSIA in Ireland is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Within the budget available to the Department, grant funding is allocated on as fair and equitable basis as possible. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility, with account taken where appropriate of the local authority's own resources in terms of rates and other income. It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.  In this context I continue to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads when allocating their own resources. </p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the financial crisis there were major cutbacks in funding for the national, regional and local road network. This resulted in the severe curtailment in funding for road improvement grant programmes, including the Strategic Grant Scheme, in order to focus available funding on maintenance and renewal work.  </p>  <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016-2021 and the Capital Plan Review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.  For now funding will largely continue to support the maintenance of the regional and local road network. While a limited number of improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead over the next few years, funding is not available to commit to additional schemes at this point.

My Department will be liaising with local authorities in relation to possible future projects for development in the post 2021 period and the appraisal requirements in relation to such projects. </p>  <p>  While there were major cuts in grant funding for the road network during the recession, there have been significant increases in grants in recent years.  In this context Cork County has been allocated regional and local road grant funding of &euro;50,465,240 in 2019. To date my Department has not received an application for works at Lakeview roundabout.</p>  <p>  In so far as the matter relates to a national road as well as a regional road, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, budget management and construction of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply.

In that context, my Department is currently working on a Road Traffic Bill to provide, in the main, for graduated penalties for speeding offences. </p>  <p>  The Government is still considering proposals which I have put forward for the introduction of graduated speeding penalties.  Speeding is one of the most dangerous behaviours on our roads and it is clear that further measures are needed to tackle it.  I believe that a graduated system of penalties, which would reflect the level of speeding in the level of consequence &ndash; much as we already do for levels of alcohol - is the right approach to take. </p>  <p>  While not a priority at this time, the consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts must not simply be a matter of re-enacting all current road traffic legislation into one instrument.  The benefits of consolidation are too often misunderstood and over-stated. If the project is to be of value, it will be necessary to examine each aspect of the legislation and see where it might be improved upon.  Such a project, done properly, could take up to three years to complete.</p>  <p>  There is no indication of any failure of prosecutions due to a lack of consolidation, never mind the significant problem which would need to exist to justify diverting resources from more urgent tasks to consolidation at this time.  Any decision to undertake such a project in the future will have to be balanced against the value added and the risks associated with undermining the extensive legal precedents established to date. Indeed, I understand that recent significant precedents in court decisions would suggest that consolidation should not be undertaken at this time.</p></reply>

It also includes a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical, or partly electrical and partly mechanical.  Whether or not a vehicle requires a push-start is legally irrelevant.  </p>  <p>  Escooters and powered skateboards fall into this category, and are therefore considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles.  Any users of such vehicles in a public place (as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961) must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, with penalties under road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.  </p>  <p>  As it is currently not possible to tax or insure escooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place. There is no anomaly within the law.</p>  <p>  I have requested that the Road Safety Authority research how escooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly other Member States.  The goal is to understand the road safety implications of the use of such vehicles on public roads, especially when interacting with other vehicles.</p>  <p>  I will make a decision on whether or not to amend existing legislation when I have received and considered the outcome of the Authority&rsquo;s research. I would need to be satisfied that permitting such vehicles on our roads will not give rise to safety concerns, whether for the users of such machines or for other road users including cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.</p></reply>

Tusla-funded services in County Donegal have demonstrated this approach in providing an outreach service to service users in different areas of the county, including Inishowen.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Tusla provided &euro;3,200 in funding to Lifeline Inishowen for the delivery of counselling to both adults and children.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to the development of domestic violence services.

Therefore the appropriate maximum rate of aid for the proposed project, if approved, would be 50%.</p>  <p>  The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the LAG which administers the programme in each LEADER area and my Department has no role in this matter.

Following a review of the shared ownership scheme undertaken in 2013, my Department together with the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency and local authorities, considered the affordability issues facing some borrowers, who purchased properties under the shared ownership schemes and devised a more affordable long-term path towards full home ownership.  Indeed, a range of measures have already been undertaken to reduce the monthly payments of shared ownership borrowers.</p><p>The index linked shared ownership scheme, which operated from 1999 until 2002, has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  In addition, the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers was reduced to 2.3% with effect from 1 July 2016, which has helped many shared ownership borrowers.</p><p>An innovative shared ownership restructuring option has been available to shared ownership borrowers since 2016, and involves rolling-up all outstanding debt under a share ownership arrangement into a single annuity loan.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each shared ownership borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution, which is more easily understood.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those shared ownership borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each shared ownership  borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current shared ownership arrangement may be the best option for both the shared ownership borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution. </p><p>There is no obligation on any shared ownership borrower to restructure their loan arrangement and local authorities in implementing the restructuring option will direct shared ownership borrowers to seek financial and legal advice prior to accepting any offer of a restructuring option.  The new Abhaile Service, accessed via MABS, can assist shared ownership borrowers who are in arrears to access free independent expert financial and legal advice. Full details of the supports offered by the Abhaile Service are available from <i></i>. Under the restructuring option, where shared ownership borrowers require financial and legal advice outside of that provided via MABS, local authorities will arrange to pay the cost of these fees to a maximum of &euro;1,000, excluding VAT.  Detailed guidance, training and direction have been provided by my Department and the Housing Agency to local authorities regarding the implementation of the measure and my Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the new measure for borrowers. </p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with shared ownership arrangements are available from their local authority.  Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulties making the repayments on their shared ownership arrangement.  Information in relation to the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

Given the scale and importance of the Eastern and Midlands Water Supply Project, and recognising the statutory role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as independent economic regulator of Irish Water, including its role of reviewing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans, I have requested the CRU to undertake the review to support my decision as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in relation to the capital consent that will be required in the event that planning approval is obtained for the project. The request to the CRU is consistent with the CRU&rsquo;s role under Section 40 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to advise the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the development and delivery of water services.  The review has commenced and I expect to receive a report by the end of 2019.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are available on the CRU website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

Prior to its launch, an initial tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities.</p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the amount of a second tranche, which I anticipate, will be finalised soon. When these discussions are concluded I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter. However, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans. An announcement on the amount of additional funding to be provided is not inhibiting the running of the scheme in any way.</p></reply>

Archaeological assessments are a normal part of the pre-planning phases of new development proposals. The objective of such assessments is to verify that an appropriate approach is taken in relation to any archaeological material that may be present.</p>  <p>  The assessment in this case, comprising of a geophysical survey and archaeological test excavations, identified the presence of a subsurface archaeological enclosure in one area of the development site. In light of these findings, my Department subsequently approved a licensed excavation of the enclosure site in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Acts. </p>  <p>  The excavation licence provided for the archaeological excavation and recording of the archaeological enclosure. While my Department received an interim progress report during the course of the excavation work, a standard condition of all such licences requires a formal report to be submitted to both the Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service and the National Museum of Ireland setting out the results of the excavations and subsequent scientific analysis. The licensee is also required to publish a concise account of the excavation on the excavations.ie website. </p>  <p>  The National Monuments Service and the National Museum of Ireland will receive the preliminary report of the excavation findings in the coming weeks and a final report will be submitted in due course. I will be happy to share these reports with the Deputy when they are received in my Department.  </p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Acts, planning authorities also refer development proposals that may impact on archaeological heritage to my Department for comment so that recommendations may be made, as appropriate, to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.  My Department has recently responded to such a referral in relation in this case and has asked for further information to be obtained from the applicant with regard to the results of the archaeological assessment carried out to date and of such further assessment as may be appropriate in relation to the work to which the planning application relates.  The Department has also recommended that the applicant be asked to undertake an Ecological Impact Assessment and Bat Survey of the site. My Department will respond as appropriate on receipt of further information from the planning authority.</p>  <p>  Any submission made by a prescribed body to a planning authority may be taken into consideration by the authority when making its determination on a planning application. The final decision is, however, a matter for the planning authority itself.</p></reply>
