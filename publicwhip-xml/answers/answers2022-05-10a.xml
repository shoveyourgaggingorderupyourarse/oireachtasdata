Minister Coveney discussed Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Moldova on several occasions, including at the Support Conference for Moldova on 5 April and in his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Popescu in the margins of FAC on 11 April. </p>  <p>  Ireland is supporting Moldova through the Irish Aid programme. One quarter of the &euro;20 million humanitarian package has been allocated to the UNHCR Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for neighbouring countries hosting Ukrainian refugees,  22% of which is earmarked for Moldova.  The total RRP to date is over &euro;1.7 billion.</p>  <p>  In addition, a dedicated &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding supports UNHCR&rsquo;s work specifically in Moldova. Irish Aid has also provided &euro;1.5 million to UNFPA, whose work in Moldova focuses on the protection of women and girls.</p>  <p>  Many of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian partners are expanding their activities to support the Moldovan government&rsquo;s response to the crisis. Last week, I announced that &euro;500,000 will be awarded to Plan International as part of Irish Aid&rsquo;s Civil Society Fund for Ukraine, which includes support to Moldova. Irish Aid has also granted &euro;1 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross, which works through the Moldovan Red Cross.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides humanitarian assistance through trusted humanitarian agencies to deliver aid quickly. This is done in coordination with central and local governments. We encourage our long-standing UN partners to also use prepositioned funding from Ireland to respond to the situation in Ukraine and neighbouring countries like Moldova.</p>  <p>  Together the EU and its Member States have provided nearly a combined &euro;1 billion in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. The European Commission&rsquo;s revised Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) includes support to the RRP and additional funding of &euro;13 million to Moldova. </p>  <p>  Ireland has committed to receive up to 500 Ukrainian refugees from Moldova and my Department is working with the Departments of Justice and of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for the transfer of the first group in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000062#WRB01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 89, 102, 119 and 135 together.</p>  <p>I am aware of a broadcast on a Russian television station which contained an animation depicting a wave hitting Ireland and Britain, caused by a Russian nuclear weapon.</p>  <p>  We should not allow ourselves be distracted by such rhetoric from the real atrocities being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine,  I condemned Russia&rsquo;s move to raise the alert levels of its strategic forces.  There can be no justification for threatening use of nuclear weapons. In particular, I recall the statement of the heads of the five Nuclear Weapon States, including Russia, in January 2022, that &lsquo;a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to urge maximum restraint, de-escalation and the avoidance of any nuclear rhetoric, which will only worsen an already dangerous and unpredictable situation.</p>  <p>  The judgement that the government has made is that despite our strong disagreement with the actions taken by Russia, it is better to keep diplomatic channels open, for a number of reasons. The first, fundamental, reason is that open lines of communication facilitate diplomacy - which is more important than ever in a conflict situation. Communication with the Ambassador also allows us to directly convey our disagreement with the Russian Government as it continues to fall short of its obligations. On 29 March, the Ambassador was informed that four senior officials from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Dublin were being expelled. </p>  <p>  Secondly, diplomatic engagement helps us to better protect Irish interests, and to protect our citizens - in Russia and the five central Asian republics for which Ireland is represented by our Embassy in Moscow.</p>  <p>  Finally, we need to consider our actions within the context of the wider EU response. Like all of our other responses during this crisis, we are coordinating closely with EU Member States and like minded partners.</p></reply>

I underscored the need for strong international cooperation in support of the international rules based order, now more than ever. </p>  <p>  My engagements with senior officials from President Biden&rsquo;s administration, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, as well as my meetings on Capitol Hill, were valuable opportunities to discuss priority issues, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, Brexit, immigration, and foreign policy issues such as Ukraine, the JCPOA, and Syria. </p>  <p>  On Northern Ireland, it was clear to me in my discussions that this remains a priority on a bipartisan basis across the political system in the US. The role of the US Special Envoy to NI has been greatly valued by the Irish government over many years, and the appointment of a new Envoy was something I emphasized in my exchanges.  </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to visit Boston, a city with a large and historic Irish-American population. I participated in a number of engagements including at the JFK Presidential Library, Harvard University, and Boston College, where I discussed developments in NI, Ukraine, and the EU-US relationship, and met with the local Irish community.</p>  <p>  My meetings with Governor Baker and members of the Massachusetts State House were a great opportunity to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s strong historic, political and economic links with Massachusetts and to explore how we might strengthen them further.</p></reply>

It is now for the parties to work together to form an Executive to serve all of the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>It is important, in the first instance, to acknowledge everyone that contested the election and congratulate those who have been elected.</p><p>It will take time to assess the full implications of the election results. However, two things are immediately striking. Firstly, the fact that, for the first time, a nationalist party, Sinn F&eacute;in, are entitled to nominate the First Minister.  Secondly, there is the growth in the number of MLAs elected representing the Alliance Party, who designate as neither nationalist nor unionist.  </p><p>In the period immediately following the election, it is for the political parties to come together to negotiate a Programme for Government and form an Executive, as the elected representatives of their constituencies. The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Act, enacted by the UK Government in 2022<b>, </b>gives effect to the stability provisions of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. The Act provides for a period of six weeks following the first meeting of the Assembly for the Northern Irish parties to form an Executive, followed by a further eighteen week period. However, the results of the election show a clear desire for a functioning and effective Assembly and Executive, and it is to be hoped that the parties will form an Executive as swiftly as possible.</p><p>I would like to see the early establishment of an Executive.</p><p>While there are challenges around the Protocol, discussions on the application of the Protocol proceeded previously in parallel with the work of the Assembly and the Executive.  They can do so again.  Those discussions should not be an impediment to the formation of the Executive.</p><p>I and my officials have remained and continue to remain in regular contact with the parties in Northern Ireland. I am also in frequent contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p><p>We will continue to engage with the parties and the British Government, to support the full functioning of the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope that we will see the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement up and running as soon as possible. I will continue to remain in contact with the Secretary of State, as both Governments work in partnership as co-guarantors of the Agreement, in support of power-sharing and a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

I was the first Foreign Minister to visit Kyiv since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. While in Ukraine, I met with  Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov.</p>  <p>  I expressed solidarity with and extended condolences to Minister Kuleba and the people of Ukraine. I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to humanitarian assistance and EU sanctions decisions. I also made clear that Ireland's role on the UN Security Council, the upcoming seat on the Executive Board of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and upcoming Chairmanship of the Council of Europe can be useful in highlighting the conflict in Ukraine and tackling disinformation by Russia as it occurs. I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s clear support for the fast tracking of Ukraine&rsquo;s EU membership ambitions, and indicated that Ireland would continue to take a leadership role on this issue.</p>  <p>  Defence Minister Reznikov briefed me on the situation on the ground in Ukraine, and we also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance, as well as our active roles in settings such as the EU, the UN Security Council, the Council of Europe and the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  I visited Bucha, a town 25 kilometres outside Kyiv, and met with its mayor, Mr Anatoliy Fedoruk. I saw mass graves in Bucha, where 503 civilians had been identified. I expressed the condolences of the Irish Government and people, and said that I would bear witness to the terrible atrocities in Bucha and raise this internationally, I briefed the UN Security Council the next week on what I had seen in Bucha. Those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.</p>  <p>  During the visit, I also announced additional funding of &euro;3m to the International Criminal Court, with an initial &euro;1m being given to the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and the further &euro;2m to the International Criminal Court at a later stage. This will assist with regard to all situations before the court.</p></reply>

The Court was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute.  By its very existence the Court not only promotes and upholds the rule of law but also provides a means of bringing to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. In this way it contributes in a fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been, and continues to be, a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC. We will continue to publicly support and promote the Court in all relevant international fora, including throughout the remainder of our term on the United Nations Security Council.  </p>  <p>  In addition to political support for the Court, Ireland strongly believes that the ICC should have sufficient resources to deliver upon its unique and important mandate. The ICC is funded mainly by means of annual assessed contributions made by the States Parties to the Rome Statute, determined every year at the Assembly of States Parties.  The total annual budget of the Court for 2022 is just under &euro;155 million, of which Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contribution is approximately &euro;1.2 million.  Ireland has consistently promoted a budget for the Court that is sufficient to meet the many demands placed upon it, and the recently commenced investigation into the situation in Ukraine will considerably increase those demands over coming years.</p>  <p>  Some of the Court&rsquo;s work is also supported by voluntary trust funds established for specific purposes.  These include the Trust Fund for Least Developed Countries, the Trust Fund for Victims and the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Advanced Technology and Specialized Capacity.</p>  <p>  On 14 April, during my trip to Kyiv and Bucha in Ukraine, I announced that Ireland will make a voluntary contribution of &euro;3 million to the ICC, with &euro;1 million to be distributed immediately to the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund. This funding will benefit the Prosecutor&rsquo;s work in all situation countries, not just Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland further believes that supporting victims is a critical part of implementing the Rome Statute and ensuring accountability. The ICC&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Victims was established to respond to the harm resulting from the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. Ireland will provide a voluntary contribution of &euro;200,000 to the Trust Fund for Victims in 2022, to be split equally between its reparations and assistance mandates. This brings the total contribution of Ireland to the Trust Fund for Victims to over &euro;1.7 million since 2004.</p>  <p>  Finally, mindful that the ICC is the world&rsquo;s first permanent international criminal court, participation by all States is necessary to achieve the universality of the Rome Statute. Ireland has provided a voluntary contribution of &euro;10,000 to the Trust Fund for Least Developed Countries for 2022. This trust fund provides financial assistance to enable delegates from the least developed countries and other developing states to attend the annual session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute.</p></reply>

This 25% reduction in processing times is as a direct result of the unprecedented level of investment that my Department has made in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. </p>  <p>  Over 400,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to a total of 634,000 passports issued in 2021. 117,000 passports were issued in April alone with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days. </p>  <p>  First time passport applications do take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications are currently taking 30 working days to process.</p>  <p>  In terms of staffing, the Department has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive over the past several months. Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.</p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times in 2022, particularly for first time applicants. The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service including working targeted overtime to focus on key areas such as first time applications, intensive training of staff and enhanced public information resources. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to further reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p>  <p>  With regard to the online Passport Tracker, this tool provides applicants with an indication of how their application is progressing through the system and gives an estimated issue date based on the current average application processing time.   </p>  <p>  The date displayed on the tracker is an estimate, and is based on the current average processing time for that type of application. For a small number of applications currently in the Passport Service system, the issue by date displayed on the tracker differs from the issue by date on the Passport Service internal processing system by one to three days. The Passport Service regrets any inconvenience caused to applicants who have been affected. The cause of this issue has been identified by the Passport Service and they are working to rectify it.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service Customer Service Hub officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as with enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. The Customer Service Hub handled over 175,000 enquiries in 2021 and is currently handling over 5,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green. I am confident that the recruitment of additional staff, along with significant training initiatives, will have a positive impact on our response to customer service demand.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Gannon's question in relation to refund of fees for passports that are not issued within the usual turnaround times, the vast majority of fully complete and correct applications are issued within turnaround times.  A delay may, for example, be incurred for reasons such as the Passport Service attempting to contact a witness on multiple occasions rather than requesting the applicant to complete a new identity and consent form.   Therefore such a measure would be very challenging to implement when the complexities with some applications is taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

The EU-UK Joint Committee met on 21 February and the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on 8 March. </p>  <p>  The EU has listened carefully to the genuine concerns expressed by citizens and business in Northern Ireland about the Protocol, including in the run up to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections. </p>  <p>  The clear message I have heard first hand from people and businesses in Northern Ireland is that they want the Protocol to work well.  They see the very real opportunities, including for jobs, trade and investment, which are presented by the Protocol for Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU also want these to be fully realised. This was why last October the Commission made proposals to address directly the concerns raised by people in Northern Ireland. These include proposals to reduce significantly checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and giving people in Northern Ireland a greater say in how the Protocol works. In April, the EU adopted legislation to ensure the continuity of medicines supply to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Member States support for minimising disruption in Northern Ireland remains strong.  The flexibility shown by the EU now needs to be reciprocated by the UK Government. </p>  <p>  I remain in regular contact with counterparts in the EU, UK and the US and I have spoken in recent days to Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis and US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan.  </p>  <p>  Our message is clear.  We continue to urge the UK government to engage constructively with the EU. Only joint solutions can provide long-term legal certainty and predictability to Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The protection of civilians is an obligation on all parties to conflicts, and Ireland has called on all parties to the fighting in Syria to take the necessary steps to ensure that civilians are not harmed. </p>  <p>  In September 2020 I spoke at an event in the UN General Assembly on accountability for human rights violations by the Syrian regime, where I set out Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for efforts to ensure accountability for all crimes committed in Syria. As a member of the United Nations Security Council since January 2021, Ireland has consistently called for justice and accountability for all violations and abuses of human rights law and international humanitarian law in Syria, and will continue to do so. </p>  <p>  In addition to EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, Ireland provides political and financial support to a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIM), the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission. Ireland also supports and directly funds the Syria office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which works to promote and protect human rights, the rule of law and accountability in Syria.</p></reply>

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant.</p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Lesotho, Colombia, Panama, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in "Passport Express" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed 4,774 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour and the system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. </p>  <p>  The Cork office can facilitate the issuance on the spot of an emergency passport where there is an urgent need to travel for medical reasons or due to a bereavement abroad.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options and the printing capacity of production equipment meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

The ICRC has distributed over 2,000 tonnes of medical supplies, food and relief items.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Aid rapid response register has been activated and a number of Irish rapid responders have been deployed to work with our UN stand-by partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  This Irish Aid support is additional to the efforts at home, which have seen over 27,000 Ukrainian refugees welcomed in Ireland so far.</p></reply>

Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace, in line with international humanitarian law as well as international human rights norms and standards, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.</p>  <p>  I witnessed with my own eyes the shocking aftermath of the devastation in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. I expressed to the Mayor of Bucha the sincere condolences of the Irish Government and people. I committed to bearing witness to these terrible atrocities and to raising the situation internationally. Those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.</p>  <p>  On 19 April, as I promised to the mayor of Bucha and Foreign Minister Kuleba, I briefed the UN Security Council on my visit to Ukraine. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers. At the UN Security Council, I was clear that these facts speak to an utter disregard by Russian forces for their clear and unambiguous obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians. Ireland will continue to use our membership on the UN Security Council to hold Russia accountable for its actions.</p>  <p>  Ireland is one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is providing a further &euro;3 million to the ICC. Investigation teams from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC are already actively collecting evidence from Ukraine. </p>  <p>  On 4 May, the European Commission presented proposals for a sixth package of sanctions aimed at depriving Russia and Belarus of the ability to wage war on Ukraine.  The package will include additional listings of individuals and entities, including high-ranking military officers and other individuals deemed to have been involved in committing atrocities in Bucha and in the siege of the city of Mariupol. </p>  <p>  The package also targets additional Russian and Belarussian banks, including Sberbank, Russia's largest bank. Three big Russian state-owned broadcasters responsible for Russian state propaganda will be sanctioned, and will be unable to distribute their content in any form in the EU or attract advertising.  The package also targets services, including accountancy, public relations and consultancy services to Russian companies.  </p>  <p>  A complete import ban on all Russian oil is also proposed, to be introduced in an orderly fashion, it is hoped agreement can be reached soon to ensure that EU Member States can secure alternative supplies. Crude oil will be phased out within six months, and refined products such as petrol and diesel by the end of the year. There are also provisions to prevent Russia from diversifying its client base for oil products, including a ban on the provision of insurance and financing for the shipping of Russian oil.</p>  <p>  Ireland has allocated &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, via the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN agencies. Additionally, at EU level, Ireland has contributed &euro;11.5m to an EU humanitarian assistance package of &euro;550m.</p>  <p>  The EU is providing a &euro;1.5 billion package of European Peace Facility (EPF) support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Ireland is contributing its full share (&euro;33 million), which will go towards non-lethal elements only.</p>  <p>  As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU Membership. We have come together with a group of other Member States, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.</p>  <p>  In February, the EU Council agreed a &euro;1.2 billion emergency macro-financial assistance package for Ukraine.

Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Council will also consider the EU's relations with the Western Balkans against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, and possible supports the EU can provide. We have invited the Foreign Ministers of the Western Balkans countries to join the Foreign Affairs Council for a discussion on these issues. This will be a fresh opportunity to bolster EU-Western Balkans engagement, to discuss the European ambitions of each country and to set out the expectations of the EU. </p>  <p>  EU High Representative Josep Borrell will also brief the Council on his recent visit to Chile and Panama.  Ireland has requested that the situation in Ethiopia be discussed again by Ministers, as the humanitarian situation in the conflict-affected regions of Ethiopia remains dire.</p></reply>

It is to be hoped that the report being conducted by Chief Constable Boutcher will contribute to the long process of justice, truth and acknowledgement of what happened in these awful cases, where collusion is a feature.</p>  <p>  The Government will be as supportive as possible in facilitating this, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland, in relation to the attacks conducted by the Glenanne Gang and of course other cases from the Troubles.</p>  <p>  Every family deserves access to truth and justice for their loved one.  It is vital that we make progress in addressing the painful legacy of the past, in a way that meets the legitimate needs of victims and survivors. We will continue to engage with the British Government, as we have done at every opportunity on both a political and official level, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on these issues and until a satisfactory resolution is found.   </p></reply>

Accordingly, we remain very concerned about ongoing challenges relating to adherence to rule of law standards in Hungary. The EU has engaged a multifaceted response to challenges to the rule of law within the EU and its Member States. This includes the Article 7 Treaty on European Union (TEU) procedure, the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Rule of Law Report and related peer review process at the General Affairs Council, the Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget or the so-called conditionality mechanism, and the use of infringement procedures. Ireland supports this multifaceted approach and actions taken under these procedures and mechanisms by the Commission in exercising its role as guardian of the treaties and ensuring all Member States uphold the EU&rsquo;s values and standards as well as their obligations under the Treaties.</p>  <p>  The Article 7 TEU procedure, whereby the European Council can determine whether there is a clear risk or existence of a breach of EU values by a Member State, was launched in relation to Hungary in 2018. Since this procedure&rsquo;s initiation, Ireland has participated actively in the hearings held to date at the General Affairs Council where we have urged Hungary to address its rule of law difficulties. Ireland will continue this participation, including at the next hearing on Hungary at the General Affairs Council on 23 May 2022, and values the opportunity for peer dialogue this procedure provides. </p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget is fair and serves an important purpose. Rule of law challenges risk endangering the appropriate use of EU financial resources. We hoped Hungary would have engaged constructively with the rule of law issues which the Commission identified in its informal correspondence with the Hungary government in late 2021 under the conditionality mechanism. We support the Commission&rsquo;s subsequent activation of the regulation in respect of Hungary in April 2022 given Hungary&rsquo;s lack of sufficient clarification and commitment to action. Ireland urges Hungary to engage productively with this conditionality regulation procedure and to undertake the necessary reforms to address rule of law problems. Ireland will engage fully in any Council discussions that will ultimately determine any withdrawal of EU funding to Hungary pursuant to this mechanism.</p></reply>

The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement, bringing together the British and Irish Governments under Strand Three of the Good Friday Agreement to promote bilateral co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  The Agreement provides for meetings of the Conference concerned with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters on which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals.  It also provides that the Conference may consider all-island cross-border co-operation on non-devolved issues.  </p>  <p>  At the most recent meetings of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (held in Dublin on 23 March 2022 and in London on 2 December 2021 which Minister McEntee also attended), there was a discussion on the current security situation in Northern Ireland with the Secretary of State. At these meetings both the Irish and British Governments noted the importance of the ongoing high level of co-operation in tackling terrorism, paramilitarism and associated criminality. Meetings of the Conference are in addition to the frequent engagements that I have with the Secretary of State on a range of issues concerning Northern Ireland. In addition, Irish officials based in Belfast at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat meet on an ongoing basis with their British counterparts to discuss security matters in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

As we have set out in the Programme for Government, we will work to ensure that the New Decade, New Approach agreement is implemented in full. </p>  <p>  For our part, the Government published a series of commitments, at the time of NDNA, focused on working with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. Although Covid 19 has been the understandable focus for much of the time since the NDNA agreement was reached, nevertheless progress has been made to implement those important commitments.</p>  <p>  The package of language and identity legislation agreed in New Decade New Approach was detailed and balanced and should be implemented without delay &ndash; as should all the commitments in NDNA. This would have been better done in the Assembly as intended but there is no reason for further delay or deadlock over the positive measures agreed in support of linguistic diversity and cultural expression in Northern Ireland. It should be advanced on the basis of the legislative provisions negotiated, agreed and published at the time of NDNA.  I look forward to seeing progress on this legislation in Westminster as soon as possible, as committed to by the Secretary of State.</p>  <p>  As part of the NDNA, it was also agreed that there would be regular review meetings involving the two Governments at Ministerial level and the parties to monitor progress on its implementation, and the delivery of commitments by each Government.  On 11 January 2021, I participated in the first Implementation Review Meeting alongside the First Minister, deputy First Minister, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and party leaders in Northern Ireland. It is regrettable that a second review meeting has not been able to take place to date; however, it is hoped that a second review meeting can take place in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Of course, Assembly Elections have just taken place and the formation of an Executive is now the important focus for the parties, and we will continue to work in full support of the institutions. The full implementation of the NDNA is a key priority for the Government in the period ahead, and we will work with a new Executive and the British Government to this end. We will also work to ensure a resumption of full and regular meetings of the North South Ministerial Council as part of these efforts.</p></reply>

This 25% reduction in processing times is as a direct result of the unprecedented level of investment that my Department has made in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. </p><p>Over 400,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to a total of 634,000 passports issued in 2021. 117,000 passports were issued in April alone with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days. </p><p>There are currently 183,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p><p>Passport Service figures show that of the total number of passport applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. Applications that are incomplete cannot be processed within the average turnaround times.</p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service </p><p>In relation to applications from county Cork, as with applications from all citizens, these are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork, on the basis of the type of application rather than county of residence of the applicant. Passport application turnaround times are the same for all citizens regardless of county of residence. </p><p>The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:</p><p>- The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.</p><p>- A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.</p><p>- The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021. </p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.</p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.</p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London. </p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. </p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.</p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.</p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.</p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly. </p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p><p>The numbers of passport applications currently in the Passport Service system from counties Cork, Kerry, Kildare and Wicklow are outlined below in tabular form.</p><p>The table outlines the total number of applications in the system by county as well as the number that are currently being processed by the Passport Service and the number of applications that require further action from the applicant, such as the submission of additional documentation. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Total Applications in System</th>       <th>Passport Service Processing</th>       <th>Further action required by applicant</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>9,053</td>       <td>5,360</td>       <td>3,693</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>2,128</td>       <td>1,284</td>       <td>844</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>4,343</td>       <td>2,603</td>       <td>1,740</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>2,680</td>       <td>1,556</td>       <td>1,124</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.  Staffing levels will be maintained right throughout the year with priority given to FBR processing once the current high demand for passports reduces. </p>  <p>  There are currently 36,000 applications awaiting processing. In 2021, over 7,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications were processed and a further 4,454 have been processed so far this year.  Foreign Birth Registration staff have continually provided an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the allocation of additional resources to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. I am confident that the additional staff being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times for Foreign Birth Registration this year.</p></reply>

Together, these are the most extensive sanctions in the history of the EU. The aim of these sanctions is to deprive the Russian government, and the supporters and enablers of this war, of the means to continue their illegal aggression against Ukraine. </p><p>The sanctions are composed of both sectoral measures, which target specific economic sectors, industries or broad areas (such as the media), and of individual measures, which apply to named people and entities.</p><p>The sectoral sanctions  target the Russian financial, energy, technology and defence, and transport sectors. Similar sanctions have also been introduced on Belarus, in view of the support that it has given to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Restrictive measures on trade with the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Ukraine have been introduced. Restrictions have also been put in place on the broadcasting of certain Russia state-owned media platforms in the EU, to limit the spread of disinformation.</p><p>The financial sanctions on Russia are particularly wide-ranging, affecting most of the Russian banking system, as well as key State-owned companies. Among other things, they ban transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, restrict Russian access to the EU&rsquo;s capital and financial markets, and exclude key Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system.</p><p>The sixth sanctions package is expected to include additional listings of individuals, such as high-ranking Russian military officers responsible for atrocities in Bucha and the siege of Mariupol. Additional entities in the Russian defence sector are also expected to be sanctioned, bringing the total number of entities sanctioned to close to 100. On the financial side, three more Russian banks, including Sberbank, are to be removed from the SWIFT financial messaging system. The sale and transfer of EU property to residents of Russia it to be prohibited, as will the provision of audit and accountancy services, tax and other consultancy services and public relations services to Russian companies. Export controls are to be further strengthened. An additional three major Russian State-owned broadcasters will also be sanctioned. </p><p>Significantly, it is planned to ban the import of Russian oil to the EU, with a phasing-out period to ensure that Member States can secure alternative supplies. This follows the ban on imports of Russian coal to the EU, as introduced in the fifth sanctions package, which will be effective from August. </p><p>General principles guiding the adoption of EU sanctions are that they must be sustainable for Member States to implement, and that they should cause more damage to the sanctioned parties than to the EU. All proposals for new EU sanctions concerning Russia and Belarus are prepared in close coordination with partner countries, such as the US and the UK, to ensure that they will have maximal impact.</p><p>To date, Ireland has supported the widest possible sanctions, and has expressed openness to additional tough measures, including a possible future ban on the import of Russian gas. EU Member States will continue to consider further sanctions until a ceasefire in Ukraine can be agreed and the Russian invasion is deemed to have ended.</p></reply>

Over 9 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, I welcome the Government of Ethiopia's recent announcement of an indefinite humanitarian truce, and the statement on cessation of hostilities by the Tigrayan authorities.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this progress, the situation continues to be unpredictable and access challenges an obstacle to the delivery of the needed quantities of essential humanitarian assistance persist.  The possibility of a return to active hostilities remains. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the ongoing mediation work of African Union Special Envoy Olusegun Obasanjo and encourage engagement by all sides in his efforts to secure a lasting negotiated settlement and cessation of hostilities. A truly inclusive national dialogue and reconciliation process would help attain a sustainable peace. </p>  <p>  Ireland has played a leading role in the international response to the crisis, through our bilateral engagements, at the UN Security Council and within the European Union. Ethiopia was discussed at the Security Council most recently on 14 April, when the focus was on the humanitarian situation.  At that meeting Ireland called for immediate implementation of the humanitarian truce and delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need. A discussion on Ethiopia will take place at the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 May, a move supported by Ireland to ensure the situation in Ethiopia remains high on the EU&rsquo;s agenda.  </p>  <p>  In addition to our work  to ensure a continued international focus on resolving this crisis, we have also been taking action directly to alleviate the humanitarian toll of the conflict. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, contributed almost &euro;25 million to the humanitarian response in Ethiopia last year and this year is providing further support to tackle ongoing humanitarian need.</p></reply>

Our current term on the UN Security Council for 2021-2022 actively reflects that commitment while mainstreaming human rights across all areas of the Security Council agenda.</p><p>Since the illegal, unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces on 24 February, Ireland has stood in unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Ukraine. We continue to work at the UN, EU, International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe, the OSCE to bring an end to this war and to ensure accountability for violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.</p><p>At the UN, Ireland has been at the forefront of efforts to hold Russia accountable for its actions. At the Security Council and the General Assembly, we have urged others to join us in condemning the Russian invasion and calling for an immediate withdrawal from the entire territory of Ukraine. </p><p>Likewise, in my remarks to the high level segment of the 49<sup>th</sup>Human Rights Council (HRC), I focused exclusively on the situation in Ukraine, calling for an immediate ceasefire, unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces, full respect for human rights and the holding to account of all perpetrators of violations and abuses of human rights. In March, Ireland supported the establishment of an independent international commission of inquiry, comprising three human rights experts who have already been appointed. This will complement the existing UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine deployed in 2014. </p><p>The HRC, based in Geneva, is the primary international forum responsible for advancing respect for human rights. Our previous membership of the Council (2013-15) enabled us to contribute substantively to the promotion and protection of human rights. In order to continue this work, Ireland intends to seek our next term on the HRC for the period 2027 &ndash; 2029.</p><p>The EU has also responded swiftly to impose unprecedented sanctions against Russia together with a commitment to provide over a billion euros in support to Ukraine.</p><p>Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of a strong international criminal justice system and we remain consistent in our support for the Court. Ireland is one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court and we are providing a further &euro;3 million which will assist with regard to all situations before the court.</p></reply>

The Embassy has maintained regular contact with all relevant stakeholders in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances and issues around the Cerrejon mine, and has also engaged with stakeholders through the EU Delegation in Colombia. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that officials in my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the region of La Guajira and across Colombia, and engage on these issues.  </p><p>We recognise that addressing social, land-related and environmental issues is an essential component of Colombia&rsquo;s peace process and we remain committed to supporting Colombia in the comprehensive implementation of the 2016 Peace Agreement and its transition to a stable, peaceful, post-conflict society, including by means of funding channelled through the EU, the UN and various NGOs operating in-country. </p><p>More broadly, in the area of business and human rights, my Department works closely with the multi-stakeholder Implementation Group for the National Plan on Business and Human Rights.  This Group regularly engages with experts and considers best practice.  Most recently, at the Group&rsquo;s request, my Department&rsquo;s Civil Society Forum, which took place on 27 April, included a session on the EU draft Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence.</p></reply>

The Amnesty International report shines a clear spotlight on the illegal and unacceptable treatment of the Palestinians by the Israeli state.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on these matters is &ndash; and will continue to be &ndash; based on international law including international human rights law, Israel&rsquo;s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. Ireland has been consistently forthright in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people, as outlined in the Amnesty and other reports, on a regular basis directly with the Israeli authorities, including during visits to the region, as well as at EU and UN level. Ireland has been proactive in consistently highlighting these issues at the UN Security Council. At the most recent meeting of the Council on the Middle East on 25 April, Ireland expressed our particular concern at the recent escalation in tensions in East Jerusalem. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, Ireland&rsquo;s priority is to try to find a way to change the reality on the ground. Ireland will use the recommendations and conclusions of the Amnesty International report to influence the approach that we take towards trying to protect and encourage a peace process that can deliver a two-state solution, which is the Government's priority.</p></reply>

Ireland was part of a core group of States, led by Liechtenstein, which brought this &lsquo;veto initiative&rsquo; to the General Assembly on 26 April, where it was supported by the wider UN membership and adopted.  </p><p>This now means that, whenever a veto is used, the General Assembly will automatically hold a debate, require the Council to submit a report and invite the Member State which used its veto to make a statement.  Ireland has long called for increased accountability and transparency in Security Council decisions and this is an important new element and we are pleased that we were able to work together with other States to bring about change.</p><p>Ireland is actively engaged in seeking reforms and making a positive impact across the work of the entire United Nations. We have particular influence when we serve on decision-making bodies such as the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. Ireland intends to seek membership of the Human Rights Council for the period 2027 &ndash; 2029, where we will continue to use our voice to push for accountability, compliance with international law and the promotion of human rights. </p></reply>

These Regulations do not apply in certain circumstances such as buying from another consumer, buying from a business outside the EU or when certain goods or services are purchased.</p>  <p>  The information requirements facilitate the consumer making an informed decision before a purchase is made or a contract is entered into and removes any surprises such as hidden charges.  It is in the interests of the consumer that they read this information before agreeing to make a purchase.  The information requirements should be in clear and simple language and include:</p>  <p>  - the main characteristics of the purchase</p>  <p>  - the contract duration (if applicable)</p>  <p>  - the total cost and any additional charges that are to be paid</p>  <p>  The Regulations provide protections after goods are purchased or a service signed up to online, such as a statutory right to cancel (called a cooling-off period), timeframes for delivery if none have been agreed and timeframes for refunds from a business when the right to cancel has been exercised.</p>  <p>  The Regulations provide 14 days for a consumer to change their mind about a purchase (with some exceptions).  For goods bought, the 14 days begins on the day they are received and for a service, it begins on the day the contract is concluded.  If the business does not inform the consumer of their right to cancel, the cooling-off period can be extended to a maximum of 12 months.  After the business is notified of a cancellation, the consumer has a further 14 days to return the goods to them. </p>  <p>  Delivery times depend on what was agreed at time of purchase, e.g., if a website says delivery will be within 3-5 days, then that is what has been agreed. However, if no delivery timeframe is agreed, then the Regulations state that delivery must be within 30 days. If delivery does not happen within the timeframe agreed, the consumer can either agree a different date or can cancel the contract and get a refund.</p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that a business must refund the consumer without undue delay and not later than 14 days after the order is cancelled, where it is cancelled within the cooling-off period.  A business can hold on to the refund until it has proof that the consumer has sent the goods back.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of these Regulations falls within the remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). </p>  <p>   Users of the Internet can sometimes fall victim to or encounter an online scam in which attackers attempt to obtain personal information such as logon profiles or banking details or where they are tricked into paying for something that the person has no right to sell or provide. In addition, users may receive emails offering them the chance to obtain a windfall through some means and they need to be aware of the possibility of being scammed.</p>  <p>  Where a consumer believes they have been the victim of an online scam or fraud they should report it to their local Garda Station in the first instance, as this is a criminal matter and will be dealt with as a criminal offence.  They may also use the online reporting service of the website or forum on which they were scammed.  </p>  <p>  The Consumer Rights Bill 2022, which will be brought before the Oireachtas this week, will consolidate and update existing legislation on the sale of goods and supply of services to ensure that it is fit for the modern digital age and it will also enhance the enforcement powers of the CCPC.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will modernise Irish law by including new protections for consumers in relation to digital content (audio and video files, computer games etc.) and digital services streaming services, cloud computing, social media etc.). The Bill will also introduce protections against unfair, misleading and aggressive commercial practices and terms. For instance &ndash; there will be new protections against unfair commercial practices relating to fake product reviews, online search queries, the resale of event tickets acquired by using bot software and other matters.</p></reply>

This, in combination with the improved access to remote working, will lead to improved potential for sustainable employment in the regions.</p><p>Digital Infrastructure is one of four key dimensions of the Government's National Digital Strategy, Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework. A robust broadband infrastructure will be vital in enabling businesses to take advantage of digital technologies and to increase sustainable employment. </p><p>Good connectivity will be essential in achieving  our goal of driving a step change in the digitalisation of businesses. The National Digital Strategy also sets out specific targets in this regard including: 75% enterprise take-up of cloud, big data, and AI by 2030; and 90% of SMEs at a basic level of digital intensity by 2030.</p><p>The National AI Strategy, AI &ndash; Here for Good, sets out how Ireland can be an international leader in using AI to benefit our economy and society, through a people-centred, ethical approach to its development, adoption and use. The National AI Strategy outlines a roadmap for ensuring that Ireland has a future-oriented workforce with the skills to drive the development, deployment and use of AI.</p><p>The adoption of digital technologies by all businesses,  in particular SMEs, is vital to sustain Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for leading digital  enterprises; and maximise the benefits of the digital transition for the wider  ecosystem, across productivity, innovation and competitiveness.</p><p>In addition to facilitating the uptake of digital technologies, broadband connectivity facilitates remote working for employees. Last year, my Department launched the National Remote Work Strategy, Making Remote Work, whose objective is to ensure that remote working is a permanent feature of the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. Widespread, high-speed connectivity is key to achieving that objective.</p><p>Our overall digital connectivity  target, as outlined in the National Digital Strategy, is to ensure that all Irish households  and businesses will be covered by a  Gigabit network service no later than  2028, with all populated areas covered  by 5G by no later than 2030.</p></reply>

As there is currently only one offshore wind farm operating in Ireland, the contribution of offshore wind is currently relatively small and is reported together with the onshore wind figures. The Energy in Ireland report is published one year in arrears, therefore official figures for 2021 will be available in the report to be published in December of this year.    Provisional estimates provided to my Department by EirGrid indicate that approximately 31GWh of electricity was generated in Ireland in 2021, of which approximately 35% was generated from renewable sources. The majority of renewable electricity was generated from onshore and offshore wind, which provided approximately 31% of total electricity generated.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to the achievement of 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030. A number of steps were completed last year to progress this target including the publication of a Government policy framework for the development of Ireland's Offshore Electricity Transmission System, the publication of a Government policy framework for Ireland's commercial ports to develop infrastructure to support offshore renewable energy, and the prioritisation of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act, which was enacted in December 2021. This Act underpins an entirely new, streamlined and Aarhus-compliant marine planning system for offshore renewable energy development. This year, my Department opened the application window for the first Maritime Area Consents (MACs) to be issued under this new legislation and by the end of this year, the first in a series of offshore wind specific auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) will be launched, providing a dedicated route to market for offshore wind projects. </p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway within my Department to develop a new Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II), which together with the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), will provide a framework for the sustainable development of Ireland's offshore renewable energy resources in the longer term, with due consideration of key economic, environmental and social factors.</p></reply>

In their recent communication 'REPower EU', the European Commission have stated that an additional 15 million tonnes (mt) of renewable hydrogen, on top of the 5.6 mt foreseen under the Fit for 55, can replace 25-50 bcm per year of imported Russian gas by 2030.The communication includes a number of measures proposed by the Commission to help Europe achieve this ambition.   </p>  <p>  Green hydrogen can play a role in &ldquo;difficult-to-decarbonise&rdquo; sectors where energy efficiency, electrification and direct use of renewables are not feasible solutions, in particular those identified in the Climate Action Plan 2021 such as heavy transport (heavy-duty vehicles, maritime and aviation), as a source for high-temperature heat in industry and flexible generation in electricity.   </p>  <p>  A hydrogen strategy for Ireland is a key priority in the April 2022 Energy Security Framework, with a target date of Q3 2022 for its delivery. The hydrogen strategy will outline the pathways towards the production of green hydrogen and its use in Ireland&rsquo;s energy mix. My Department is finalising preparations for a public consultation to gather the views of stakeholders and interested parties which will inform the development of this strategy.Nuclear powered electricity generation plants are prohibited in Ireland and the Government has no plans to revisit the prohibition on, or explore the development of, nuclear powered electricity generation in Ireland.</p></reply>

In line with commitments in the National Retrofit Plan, the Government recently announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. Included in these measures was the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with heat pump. All households built and occupied before 2021 are eligible to apply for a grant of up to &euro;1,200 to install a solar thermal system.</p>  <p>  The grant rates were set following a comprehensive evaluation and consultative process led by SEAI and the Department, including leveraging learning and experience in SEAI, industry consultation, customer research and analysis of cost data. SEAI will monitor cost data on an ongoing basis to track and monitor changes in the market. The grant rates will be kept under review taking account of: the overarching need to build a much bigger home upgrade sector; evolving science; innovation; evolving technology and other relevant factors.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emissions reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

Since its relaunch it has attracted significant interest, and a strong pipeline of projects has developed.    The total carbon reduction as a result of the EXEED scheme is 4,597.69tCO2. This figure reflects commitments made through stage 2 letters of offer in 2021. </p>  <p>The SEAI assesses value for money in a number of ways, including the cost to SEAI i.e. grant amount offered, per kWh of primary energy saved annually and per lifetime tCO2 saved (over 15 years). This represents very good value for money and within the business case parameters of the programme. The SEAI estimates the cost per lifetime tCO2 saved (over 15 years) is &euro;27.56.  </p></reply>

Renewable energy projects compete under the RESS in auctions for support for a period up to 16.5 years under a two-way floating feed in premium. This means that they receive the price they bid in at which for RESS-1 projects was an average of &euro;74.08/MWh, which is significantly below the current average wholesale electricity price.    The two-way mechanism means that projects receive support from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy up to the price they bid in at.

The Government has set out how it intends to provide the required infrastructure investments through policies such as the National Development Plan, the National Planning Framework and Housing for All.    </p>  <p>  The 2021 Climate Action Plan (CAP 2021) recognises the contribution of construction activity to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and commits to working with stakeholders to increase the use of low carbon materials and technologies in the construction and renovation of buildings in Ireland, informed by evolving EU standards and by best practice in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  CAP 2021 includes actions to support the decarbonisation of Ireland's construction activity and promote the introduction of alternative, low carbon methods of construction. Recent experience with defective materials in new home construction underlines the need to take a robust performance-based approach to the adoption of low-carbon materials. Alternative materials must meet the requirements of all parts of the building regulations, including requirements relating to durability, fire safety, structure, and resistance to moisture. CAP 2021, therefore, proposes an approach based on environmental certification, and a framework for calculating the embodied carbon of a building.</p>  <p>  The proposed revision to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, as part of the EU 'Fit for 55' legislative package, will introduce new requirements in relation to zero-emissions buildings, minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings, and declarations of global warming potential for new buildings. New product requirements will ensure that the design and manufacture of construction products is based on state-of-the-art technology to make these more durable, repairable, recyclable, and easier to re-purpose.  These proposals align with the commitments in CAP 2021. </p>  <p>  EPA data indicates that greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment accounted for 13.9% of total national greenhouse emissions in 2020. However, this only represents the direct emissions associated with heating and cooling of residential and commercial buildings. Analysis published by the Irish Green Building Council on 6 May, in its draft 'Net Zero Whole Life Carbon Roadmap for the Built Environment in Ireland,' indicates that the total lifecycle emissions, including emissions associated with the construction, operation and demolition of Ireland&rsquo;s construction and built environment sectors, may account for up to 37% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions, equalling the agriculture sector in terms of its overall contribution.</p></reply>

These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.   Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%).</p>  <p>  The new grant rates available for relevant measures under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will also be available under the Better Energy Homes Scheme. This will help to ensure that homeowners are clear about which grant scheme is most appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  An air tightness test helps identify air leakage areas which need to be addressed and would be an important measure for homeowners considering the installation of a ventilation system. </p>  <p>  As schemes administrator, SEAI advise that where a heat pump grant is being sought, an airtightness test may be necessary in order to achieve the required Heat Loss Indicator, particularly if fabric measures are likely to improve airtightness. However, the SEAI also note that an air tightness test is not mandatory. </p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Homes scheme, for homeowners seeking to install a heat pump, a technical assessment will be required to assess the homes suitability for the heat pump. It would be expected that this assessment should include an assessment of the ventilation heat losses in the dwelling based on certain characteristics, e.g. number of chimneys, wall vents etc.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the SEAI advise that a post-works air tightness test may be a useful measure to carry out as it can help ensure that the work has been done correctly and encourages quality during installation. A post works Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment is a mandatory requirement under the Better Energy Homes Scheme. </p>  <p>Under the Better Energy Homes scheme, grants are available for the heat pump technical assessment (&euro;200) and the post works BER   (&euro;50).</p></reply>

An Post has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. In addition, Irish post offices are typically independent businesses that are run by postmasters. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company. The Government is committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland. The company fully understands the Government position and a sustainable, viable and customer-focused post office network is a key strategic priority for the company. </p>  <p>  The transformation programme that was agreed with the Irish Postmasters Union in 2018, was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. An Post introduced the pandemic recovery fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period. This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year. The Government recognises the importance of the high value and high quality post office network to our citizens right across the country, as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities. An Post, including through the post office network provides important services to its customers and it is contracted to provide key Government services to citizens. </p>  <p>  The work of the interdepartmental group, which was established to consider the feasibility of the new Government services, is being considered at present and the report of the Group will be brought to Government when all options have been considered. While decisions relating to the network are matters for the board and the management of the company, they continue to engage with the IPU on operational matters. The Government is committed to ensuring that An Post continues to play a vital role. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have ongoing engagement with the company, with other Departments and with key stakeholders to explore all options, in line with this commitment.</p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that as of 29 April 2022, almost 323,000 premises have now been surveyed and over 175,000 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. I am further advised that over 65,500 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 22 counties, with over 47,100 premises passed across 21 counties and available for immediate connection. NBI has further advised that over 10,500 premises have been connected, as of 29 April, and that this is increasing on a daily basis. To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and some areas are exceeding expectations.</p>  <p>In County Cork surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow, Kanturk, Fermoy and Clonakilty, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline. To date over 39,100 premises in County Cork have been surveyed, with over 17,600 premises under construction or complete and over 8,900 premises now available to order or pre-order. With regard to the area referred to in the Question, I am advised by NBI that it is anticipated that surveying will commence in the Bantry Deployment Area   in H1 2023.</p>  <p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie  .  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 29 April, 574 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 23 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.  The site at Mealagh Valley Community Centre, which is now connected, is located approximately 10km from Bantry. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/  .  </p>  <p>In County Cork 45 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/  . </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,620.</p><p>Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total. Furthermore, access to properties during restricted periods, in line with Government guidelines, was often challenging. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in Quarter 1 2022, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 27 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works.</p><p>There are currently just under 8,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.  It is important to note that the SEAI received 2,388 applications for the scheme this year, to the end of April, compared with 2,874 for the whole of 2022.  The increased publicity around the launch of the new SEAI scheme and revisions to the Warmer Homes scheme, together with increased energy costs are driving demand.</p><p>Delivering free energy upgrades to low income households and reducing the waiting times on the Warmer Homes scheme waiting list is a top priority for my Department and SEAI. In order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken:</p><p>-The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;&middot; </p><p>-SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;&middot; </p><p>-SEAI is working to Increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Any necessary further measures identified as required by SEAI to increase output under this key Scheme will also be taken and progress is kept under ongoing review.  </p><p>I understand the number of completions under the scheme in April 2022 rose to 376 which represents real progress. </p></reply>

NORA has operational responsibility for the day to day management of the State's strategic oil reserve. These reserves are available to be placed in the domestic market in the event of a shortage of petroleum products arising in the commercial supply chains or released to the international markets as part of an IEA collective action.  Member countries of the IEA, including Ireland, agreed on 1 March and 1 April to coordinated releases of strategic oil stocks to help ensure stable international energy markets.

There also continues good cooperation between Irish and UK system operators.    Gas supply from the UK is considered one of the most secure in Europe with diverse supplies of natural gas from indigenous production, pipeline connections to Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, and substantial capacity for liquified natural gas imports. However, it should be noted that the UK&rsquo;s indigenous production is decreasing, resulting in increased imports of liquified natural gas.</p>  <p>  Gas Networks Ireland and the National Grid, which operates the gas transmission system in Great Britain, have a Joint Protocol for Load Shedding at the Moffat Interconnection Point in Gas Supply Emergencies. This protocol sets out that, in the event of a shortage of natural gas supply in the UK that could affect supplies in Ireland, the overriding principal that will be applied is one of proportionality. This seeks to ensure that, in the event of a disruption to gas supplies, any reductions would be on a proportional basis across the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  The UK is no longer bound by EU law on obligations related to energy security. The UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) provides a legal framework for cooperation on security of gas and electricity supply between the EU and the UK. The TCA commits both parties to develop appropriate frameworks for cooperation with respect to the security of supply of electricity and natural gas.</p></reply>

Rural areas will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for both existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis. The NTA are working closely with IPAS (International Protection Accommodation Services) to determine likely locations and the number of individuals housed at each location.</p>  <p>  Additional bus services will also be deployed to cater for those housed away from the existing public transport network. Such measures will provide better access to a range of amenities, employment opportunities, and onward public transport connections to larger centres.</p>  <p>  A Community Transport Fund is also being established to support occasional social travel requests. This will be operated by the TFI Local Link offices and will enable our Ukrainian guests to join in the many activities available in our towns, particularly activities focused on youth, integration, culture, and education.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities for the procurement and operation of public transport services in rural areas, including in County Roscommon, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you.

This scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point.</p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points. </p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport in Summer 2022. ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure. ZEVI will therefore provide co-funding to support Local Authorities in developing local area network plans for EV infrastructure. I anticipate that the Residential Charging Scheme will be open to applications for funding  later this year. </p></reply>

The rate applicable to the half-yearly option is 55.5% of the annual rate, and, for the quarterly option, 28.25% of the annual rate. These ratios have remained generally consistent since the 1960's. The loss of income that would arise from equalising rates for these options would have a negative impact on motor tax revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or in the taxation system generally. The potential loss to the Exchequer has been estimated at just over &euro;37m, based on the volume of transactions in 2021. Given the sum involved, any proposed change is a matter for consideration in the context of Budget preparations.</p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. </p>  <p>In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th   of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the YAC will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.  To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented</p>  <p>As the Deputies will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.  This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and it is intended to roll-out the next stage of the reductions on GDA services from the 9th  of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year. The Government decision did not include broadening this initiative to include commercial bus operators.</p>  <p>  In relation to the increased patronage on public service obligation bus and train services since the price reduction of 20% in fares was introduced, this would also be a matter for the NTA who are responsible for the collection and publication of statistics relating to public transport.</p>  <p>  In view of the above,  I have forwarded the Deputies specific questions to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Licence categories were then changed, with separate categories covering Category B (cars and light vehicles) and Category BE (car or light vehicle and trailer). People licensed to drive with a trailer before 1989 were allowed to keep this entitlement by indicating this on the application form when renewing their licences. The entitlement could be restored up to ten years after last holding it. If the entitlement to drive with a trailer has lapsed for longer, drivers must apply as learners for the purposes of driving with a trailer.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the then Minister for Transport received representations from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, suggesting that many farmers who had a pre-1989 car licence had unintentionally lost their trailer entitlement when renewing their licences. The Minister agreed, on a once-off basis, to allow people in this position - whether farmers or not - to reclaim the trailer entitlement where they could prove that they had previously held it. The Road Safety Authority made arrangements to accommodate drivers in this position for a limited period (up to November 2013).</p>  <p>  It remains the case that where a person has held the BE category on their driving licence at any time in the last ten years, they can have the category added to their licence without the need to sit a driving test. </p></reply>

As is the case with all VAT exempt activities, this means that they are not required to charge VAT on their supply of the relevant services, nor are they entitled to reclaim VAT on their purchases used for the services.  This is a fundamental feature of the VAT regime at EU and national level.</p>  <p>  However, alongside the VAT system, there is a grants scheme under which bodies (including schools) which are qualifying charities may qualify for a grant in recognition of the VAT they have incurred.  The VAT Compensation Scheme was introduced in recent years to reduce the tax burden on Charities by partially compensating them for the VAT incurred in delivering on their charitable purpose. Under the scheme, charities may apply for a grant related to a proportion of their VAT costs, based on their level of funding other than from public and certain other sources. In order to be a qualifying charity for the scheme, a school would need to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners and hold a charitable tax exemption under section 207 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and be registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority. It&rsquo;s qualifying income would exclude income from public sources and educational fees. A total annual capped fund of &euro;5m is available under the Scheme.

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax.</p>  <p>  In considering the case for such a tax it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.</p>  <p>  Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. I will consider the issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns in due course.</p>  <p>  Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government, as evidenced in the Housing for All strategy where one of the four pathways in the plan is specifically dedicated to this area.</p></reply>

Decisions in relation to commercial matters such as the application of interest rate charges are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.</p>  <p>  Monetary policy for the euro area, including the setting of interest rates, is formulated by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) and implemented by the Eurosystem. Negative policy rates have been part of a comprehensive monetary policy strategy adopted by the ECB since June 2014. The policy was introduced to counteract disinflationary pressures and to stimulate spending and investment in the wake of the global financial and sovereign debt crises. The Deposit Facility Rate (DFR) has been -0.5% since September 2019. The DFR is the rate that applies to funds that banks deposit with the Central Bank and with the current levels of excess liquidity, it controls market interest rates and prompts a general repricing of interest rates across different asset classes.</p>  <p>  The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. Banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs, banks have decided that they cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason, banks have chosen to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to comment on the potential impact on clients of solicitors. However, I understand that some legal practices have already taken steps to work closely with their clients to ensure that clients' monies spends the least amount of time possible in the solicitor's client account.</p></reply>

These services, which include an online communications channel through the MyEnquiries system, are available 24/7, are easy to use and are fully secure. Revenue also provides a PAYE Helpline telephone service operating from 9.30am to 1.30pm each day.</p>  <p>To date in 2022, the PAYE service has processed over 990,000 tax returns, answered more than 247,000 telephone calls, and dealt with over 311,000 items of correspondence received through the online services and the post. Demand for the online contact channel has steadily increased in the past few years.  For the four months to 1st   May this year Revenue has received 311,000 PAYE related online contacts, the equivalent figure in 2019 was 147,000.  This represents a 111% increase.</p>  <p>  To ensure optimum support to PAYE taxpayers throughout the year, Revenue continuously reviews its service channels and deploys its resources on an agile basis to meet demand. The PAYE service is currently answering between 4,000 and 5,000 calls per day while also responding to between 4,500 and 6,000 correspondence items per day.</p>  <p>  Revenue have confirmed that the purpose of operating the PAYE Helpline until 1.30pm is to free resources to process the tax returns, the more complicated items that arise through the Helpline (that cannot be dealt with during the call), and correspondence received through the online service and post. Revenue advise that when they do not concentrate resources on processing returns and correspondence in a timely matter that this results in a spike in calls from taxpayers wondering when their correspondence and refunds will be dealt with. The deployment of resources and the model of both the PAYE phone service and online service is carefully monitored and re-calibrated as required and reflects both demand levels from PAYE taxpayers and the need to provide an efficient and cost-effective service.</p></reply>

Social media videos were not posted on this account.</p>  <p>  I am advised by those bodies under the aegis of my Department with social media accounts as follows:</p>  <p>  None of the Central Bank&rsquo;s social media posts were exclusively in a language other than English or Irish, or featured a language other than English or Irish. 3.1% of its posts were exclusively in Irish, with 0.3% featuring bi-lingual translations. All of the videos posted to social media by the Bank included subtitles and/or closed captioning </p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office (CRO) is a very small organisation with limited resources, and is not active on social media. The CRO conducted a pilot with 4 posts, all of which were in English. 3 were text and no voiceover and closed captioning. As such, none of the social media posts were exclusively in Irish or a language other than Irish or English. They did not feature a language other than English or Irish, nor any bi-lingual translation. 75% of the videos posted to social media during the specified timeframe featured closed captioning.</p>  <p>  The social media posts of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) were not exclusively in Irish or a language other than Irish or English. They did not feature a language other than English or Irish or any bi-lingual translation. All of the videos posted to social media by the FSPO during the timeframe in question included subtitles and/or closed captioning. The FSPO is currently developing a Communications and Engagement Strategy and Implementation Plan which will see further work and initiatives in relation to social media over the coming strategic period. The FSPO&rsquo;s Communications and Engagement Strategy recognises that all communications must be available in accessible formats to service users, in accordance with the Web Accessibility Directive and the Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information provided by Public Bodies. In addition, the FSPO notes the relevant provisions of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 in relation to advertising by public bodies.</p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland confirmed that while none of its social media posts were exclusively in languages other than English and Irish, 1.39% of their posts did feature languages other than English or Irish. None of the posts were exclusively in Irish or featured bi-lingual translations. 41.66% of its videos posted to social media included subtitles and/or closed captioning.</p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recognises the importance of ensuring that its ICT infrastructure is accessible. It already ensures that its videos are subtitled, that images have alt text and that content on the website is machine readable so that it is compatible with immersive readers. It is committed to ensuring that its website continues to meet the basic four POUR principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. None of the Council&rsquo;s social media posts were exclusively in Irish or a language other than Irish or English. They did not feature a language other than English or Irish, or any bi-lingual translation. The Council notes that all posts can be translated providing a web browser translator tool is enabled and that the user has translation services enabled within social media platforms.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency is active on Twitter and LinkedIn. None of its social media posts were exclusively in a language other than English or Irish, or exclusively in Irish. They did not feature any bi-lingual translations. It did feature languages other than English or Irish in 0.61% of its posts, and 79.31% of the videos posted to its social media included subtitles and/or closed captioning.</p>  <p>  The only social media platform on which the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General operates is LinkedIn and none of the posts in the timeframe specified meet the criteria stipulated.</p>  <p>  For the most part, posts from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners Twitter account link to www.revenue.ie for further information. This further information can be accessed in both English and Irish. Certain information recently added by way of advice to Ukrainians who have recently arrived in Ireland can be accessed in English, Ukrainian and Russian. In light of this, 0.26% of its social media posts were exclusively in languages other than English or Irish, and all of its videos posted to social media included subtitles and/or closed captioning. None of its other social media posts met any of the other criteria outlined.</p>  <p>  All of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland&rsquo;s social media posts were exclusively in English with all videos including subtitles and/or closed captioning.</p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission uses Twitter as a means to issue notifications to tax practitioners and accountants that a new determination has just been published on its website. All notifications are made in the English language, however if a member of the public requested the post be translated in another language, this could be accommodated. To date, the Commission has not received any requests and does not use any other form of social media.</p></reply>

With these publications we try to strike a balance between ensuring sufficient technical detail on one hand, and making the material accessible to the general public on the other. In this regard we are constantly trying to improve the documents and material in question.</p>  <p>  In particular, the production of the Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to the Budget plays an important role in helping to communicate the overall Budgetary process and key measures introduced in any one year. The Guide provides a high-level overview of the Budget. It aims to explain how money will be raised and spent in the relevant year. It has an easy-to-use format so it can be used by a wide cross-section of society. This enables citizens to take part in informed debate about the choices made by Government.</p>  <p>  Another document, the Tax Policy Changes publication sets out all of the tax measures announced in the Budget and includes the estimated yield or cost from each measure. This report also provides a detailed description of each measure, and in the event that a measure was announced in advance of the Budget, this would be referred to in this report.</p>  <p>  Budget announcements in relation to expenditure measures are a matter for the Minister for PER, and are set out in detail in the Expenditure Report. The Expenditure Report contains information regarding overall allocations for Departments, allocations at programme level, what public services will be delivered within these allocations and additional amounts for selected measures.</p></reply>

While the survey is an indicator, I would note that it appears to only survey the Alliance&rsquo;s own members and therefore cannot be said to be representative of the total market.</p>  <p>  The National Claims Information Database (NCID), managed by the Central Bank of Ireland, collects substantial amounts of verified data on employers&rsquo; and public liability insurance across all sectors and policies. According to the first NCID Report on Employers&rsquo; Liability, Public Liability and Commercial Property insurance, published last year, many businesses are accessing affordable insurance. The Report shows that in 2019, 93% of all policies had a premium of less than &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I do accept that premiums for some businesses and organisations may still be rising.  This may be due to particular issues in those sectors, which our Action Plan for Insurance Reform is addressing. The most recent Action Plan implementation report, published in March 2022, shows that some 80 per cent of actions are now being delivered, with the remainder initiated. Given the increasing priority and pace of reform under the Action Plan, it is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on benefits to customers.</p>  <p>  Both Minister of State Fleming and I have been clear on these points and have been holding the insurance sector to account on commitments made.  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has met individually with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market twice since the adoption of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. In these meetings, and in ongoing engagement with industry, Minister of State Fleming has consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums, and the need for insurers to respect the Guidelines by not settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them.</p>  <p>  These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming their commitment to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and that they are adhering to them in their direct settlements. During these meetings, Minister of State Fleming emphasised to insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is still ongoing and it may take some time for the benefits of the reforms, such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines, to feed through to reduced premiums and greater availability of insurance for businesses and other groups. Minister of State Fleming and I are continuing to work with colleagues to implement the remaining actions as a matter of priority. We will also remain proactive in engaging with industry in order to hold insurers to account, with a view to ensuring that the benefits of the reform agenda are passed on to policyholders, including businesses and other liability insurance customers.</p></reply>

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.</p>  <p>  The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his/her own individual income and personal circumstances. The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base, which ensures that it is a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State. Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC.</p>  <p>  In 2016, joint Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research found that USC represented a more stable form of revenue than income tax. The findings highlighted that USC revenues would fluctuate by less than income tax revenues whenever income is volatile, for example where the economy moves from a boom into a bust. Given the openness of the Irish economy and consequent susceptibility to economic shocks, the contribution that the USC makes to the stability of the State&rsquo;s revenue sources is considerable.</p>  <p>  The USC has played a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  USC receipts have been central to the current stability of the public finances since March 2020, despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Receipts from the USC in 2021 amounted to &euro;4.4 billion &ndash; 16.5% of total income tax receipts or 6.4% of total Exchequer receipts. The projected USC yield for 2022 is broadly similar. If USC were to be abolished, it would be necessary to raise approximately &euro;4.4 billion from other sources.</p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. In my view, a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term. As such, I have no plans to abolish the USC.</p></reply>

This is the case regardless of whether the game is a draw-based game, a scratch card game, an instant-win game, played only in Ireland, or played across the Euro Millions community.</p>  <p>  The percentage of the contribution to Good Causes funding each year that is derived from scratch cards and other instant-win games depends on the relative sales of these games compared to draw-based games in the year and the relative sales of different scratch cards and instant-win games in the year.</p>  <p>  As per the published audited accounts of the National Lottery Operator, in 2020, scratch cards and instant-win games comprised &euro;326.9m which was 36% of the &euro;918.9m total sales for that financial year. However, one cannot apply the reported percentage of total sales paid out in prizes in 2020 (which was 57.56%) and apply 65% to calculate the returns to Good Causes from sales of scratch cards and instant-win games in 2020. This is because scratch cards and instant-win games have different, higher, prize pay outs than draw-based games, such that the percentage contribution to Good Causes will have been less than 36% of the &euro;253.6m of Good Causes funding generated by 2020 sales. </p>  <p>  As an example the All Cash Tripler is a scratch card game with tickets priced at &euro;3 and a prize payout of 64%. For every &euro;1 of sales of All Cash Tripler: 64c goes into Prizes, 23.4c goes to Good Causes, 6c goes to the retailer in commission, and the remaining 6.6c goes the Operator.</p>  <p>The Operator does not publish audited figures for the precise contribution to Good Causes funding each year that   is derived from scratch cards and other instant-win games, in either monetary or percentage form. I would note that the Regulator of the National Lottery is aware of the percentage contribution through her Office&rsquo;s regular oversight of the National Lottery. Furthermore, the Operator has confirmed that it publishes all required sales information in its audited financial accounts but considers the level of detail requested to be commercially sensitive under the Licence and is not to be disclosed. It may be noted in this regard, that that the Lottery Regulator is required under Clause 20.6 of the Licence, to seek the Operator&rsquo;s consent to release such information and that consent has not been forthcoming in this instance. </p></reply>

The Steering Group has agreed an implementation plan for the delivery of this service and there has been significant progress made to date in relation to its implementation.<i></i>There are a number of subgroups reporting to the Steering Group which deal with technical, communications and legal issues.</p><p>Within Met &Eacute;ireann, the Chief Hydrometeorologist is leading the establishment and development of the Flood Forecast Centre (FFC) and is currently supported by 7 hydrometeorologists and 1 Principal Meteorological Officer. The staffing complement at the FFC is now at 9 persons.</p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann staff have developed prototype forecast models for all 36 Hydrometric Areas in Ireland using the preferred flood forecasting software. These have all been integrated into software that will automate the running of the models and the production of flood forecasts. The pre-operational version of the national scale flood forecast system was completed at the end of 2021. Testing, identification of data gaps and improvement of this system will continue to be carried out. This will also involve close liaison with end users (primarily local authorities) to provide feedback on what services they will require from the system.</p><p>When fully operational, this service will be of significant benefit to communities and individuals to prepare for and lessen the impact of flooding. The service will deal with flood forecasting from fluvial and coastal sources and when established it will involve the issuing of flood forecasts and general alerts at both national and catchment scales. Existing flood forecasting and warning systems and arrangements will continue to be maintained until the national service is fully operational.</p></reply>

The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include, the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework on 31 March.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs and employees. It is anticipated that Departments and Offices will have these policies completed as soon as possible but no later than end-Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  In developing their own policies, Civil Service Departments and Offices will have the flexibility to determine matters such as the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite and the roles that are suitable for blended working.</p>  <p>  Access to blended working by civil servants will be dependent on Departments/Offices having the ability to meet the needs of the business.  In general, remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis, as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer. Any requirements an employee may have for flexible working arrangements should be discussed directly with their employer.  </p>  <p>  The Government announced, on 10 February this year, a suite of measures to mitigate the impact of recent inflation on citizens and assist with rising costs of living.  This package builds on the measures announced as part of Budget 2022, which included a range of measures to support citizens including social protection rate increases, increases in tax bands and other affordability measures.</p></reply>

Their continued contribution has been essential to getting us through this difficult time. </p><p>After careful consideration, the Government made decisions earlier this year in relation to recognition of these efforts.  A national day of recognition and commemoration to recognise the contribution of all workers across the economy was held on the 18<sup></sup>March this year.  Furthermore, an additional permanent public holiday will be in place from next year. </p><p>The Government took many factors into consideration when coming to a decision in relation to any additional recognition measure for specific sectors and workers.  It was agreed that it would be appropriate to further acknowledge the contribution of those working in certain clinical settings in recognition of the fact that they were working in environments where Covid-19 was definitely present and the increased risk associated with that.</p><p>Overall, this is a balanced package of measures that benefits workers across the economy, while also recognising in particular the risks faced by certain healthcare workers during this pandemic. </p><p>The detailed administrative arrangements and terms and conditions associated with this measure are matters for my colleague the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process.</p>  <p>  Equality objectives and indicators are published every year in the REV and the Public Service Performance Report.  The initial focus of Equality Budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was extended to other dimensions of equality including disability and socioeconomic inequality.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the OECD published a report on Equality Budgeting in Ireland, providing 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equalities data strategy, the CSO completed a data audit in cooperation with my Department, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. A report on this audit was published in October 2020. </p>  <p>  In order to support the continuing development of performance budgeting in Ireland, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has been successful in its application to the EU&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). The project that the EU is funding under this Programme is providing Ireland with the opportunity to work with technical experts from the EU and OECD as well as other international experts in order to take stock of how effectively performance budgeting has been working and to consider future directions for ongoing reform drawing on international best practice. This project also takes cognisance of the other reform initiatives (e.g., equality budgeting, green budgeting, and well-being budgeting).</p>  <p>  An inter-departmental group has also been established for Equality Budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments. This group plays a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting.  </p>  <p>  In Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, the Government set out a commitment to developing a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring.  In terms of setting out an overall well-being framework, in July 2021, the Government published the First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland.  The Report sets out an overarching vision of the Well-being Framework: enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Expenditure Report 2022, the next phase of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform's work in this area is to develop an approach for associating public expenditure with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework.  The intention is to develop over time a way of setting out budgetary decisions on the basis of well-being dimensions; an approach that would complement the existing Vote Group approach to presenting such decisions.  </p></reply>

This measure was the key ask from the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector on a national, regional and local basis.</p><p>Funding for the arts and culture sector also includes the following: &euro;4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force; &euro;5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public and deliver progress in their ongoing programme of investment; and &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme delivering rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022.  </p><p>Many of these investment programmes under will be delivered through the local authorities. </p><p>Earlier this year,I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision in principle to extend the Creative Ireland Programme until 2027.  Creative Ireland was launched in 2017 as an all-of-government culture and wellbeing programme committed to the vision that every person should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  Established as a legacy initiative of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, Creative Ireland collaborates across government and with arts, community and voluntary organisations to deploy creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic success.  Alongside its very successful Creative Youth initiative, the programme&rsquo;s Creative Communities partnership with the 31 local authorities, and their delivery of thousands of creative projects, has been key to enabling community-led nationwide engagement.  Last week, I announced the details of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2022, which will take place on Saturday 11 June 2022 with events in every county.  <b></b>This initiative<b></b>is being delivered through the network of Creative Ireland Coordinators and local authority Culture and Creativity Teams in each of the 31 local authorities and is supported by RT&Eacute;. </p><p>My role as Minister with responsibility for leading the co-ordination of the Decade of Centenaries Programme (2012-2023) is to help ensure that the challenging events of this important and formative period in our history and related themes, are meaningfully, proportionately and sensitively remembered.  Last December, I announced funding of &euro;2 million for local authorities in 2022, to support their leading role in developing community-led commemorative activities, for the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries Programme.</p><p>I am very cognisant of the challenges faced by the arts, culture and live entertainment industry as the sector recovers post-pandemic.  As mentioned earlier,  I have provided a &euro;50 million suite of supports for the live performance sector in 2022, to provide performance and employment opportunities for artists and crews, including &euro;5m for Local Authorities to support local artists and performances through the LLPSS (Local Live Performance Support Scheme).  This scheme in particular has provided thousands of hours of employment for local musicians, artists and crews.</p><p>In response to Covid-19,  capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021  by my Department is intended to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces that can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm.</p><p>It is worth noting that much of the nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres were initiated and funded by local authorities. These centres are also supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Projects supported included the provision of new integrated art centres, theatres and studio space and the refurbishment of existing performance spaces.  Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country.</p></reply>

This included &euro;50 million funding for Tourism Business Continuity schemes. </p><p>The Tourism Business Continuity Schemes for 2022 are managed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and will support businesses across the tourism sectors that need it most urgently.  They will take into account the Government funding that has already been received and the wider context of the horizontal supports provided by Government. The details of the Schemes are as follows:</p><p>- The Strategic Tourism Transport Business Continuity Scheme 2022 </p><p>- The Strategic Ireland-Based Inbound Agents Tourism Business Continuity Scheme 2022</p><p>- The Attractions and Activity Tourism Operators Business Continuity Scheme 2022 </p><p>- The Tourism Accommodation Providers Business Continuity Scheme 2022 </p><p>There  was a &euro;35 million increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund for 2022 to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. </p><p>The Budget also included &euro;36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.</p><p>Funding was also provided for a range of industry initiatives including a domestic marketing and festival campaign, investment in digital, skills development and staff retention. The tourism sector also benefited from a range of cross-government horizontal measures.  </p><p>The extension of the reduced 9% VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors, which was announced today by the Minister for Finance, will give the sectors time to rebuild and consolidate after a harrowing two years under Covid-19. The extension will promote business survival  and support employment in the industry.</p><p>As for the impact of Covid-19 on hotels or restaurants, no specific audit of affected tourism businesses has been carried out; however, according to the Central Statistic Office's recent publication - <b>Business signs of Life series Two: Business Survival 2020 to 2021</b>- one in ten (10.4%) enterprises trading prior to Covid-19 were at risk of closing at the end of 2021 while F&aacute;ilte Ireland advises that there are more hotels on their register in 2022 than in 2021.</p></reply>

Further detail of the plan, its background, public and stakeholder consultation and relevant agencies such as the Heritage Council can be also found at this web page. </p><p>The Office of Public Works is responsible for managing maintaining and presenting some of Ireland&rsquo;s iconic heritage properties, including two World Heritage Sites, 780 National Monuments and over 2,000 acres of gardens and parklands.  Details are available on its HeritageIreland website at this link </p><p>From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective, in 2019 and 2020, I provided funding through the all-of-government Creative Ireland Programme based in my department to the Historic Houses of Ireland (HHI) &ndash; a representative organisation for Ireland's privately owned historic houses and castles.  This support enabled HHI to survey their membership and explore/appraise the creative potential of historic houses focusing on:<ol type="1"><li>the potential for historic houses that enable public access and host events, support local economies/communities, and also contribute to a sense of wellbeing;</li><li>how to promote historic houses as &quot;creative spaces&quot; as part of a wider creative ecosystem including opportunities for local artists, enterprises and cultural groups; and</li><li>how historic houses and their associated grounds could be used as centres for learning and educational initiatives for children.</li></ol>In 2020, I was delighted to see a very comprehensive report published by HHI entitled Historic Irish Houses &ndash; A Creative Reappraisal (available at ).  I immediately supported a workshop organised by the Creative Ireland Programme and HHI which sought to foreground the opportunities for historic house owners in relation to the hosting of micro-festivals.  More recently, I am providing funding to HHI through the Creative Ireland Programme to support Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2022 which is taking place on 11<sup></sup>June.  This will see HHI deliver Big House Inside Out &ndash; a series of free, fun, creative events for children and young people at selected Irish historic houses.  I very much enjoyed launching Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2022 at Killruddery House last week where I saw first-hand the wonderful opportunities that exist for privately-owned historic houses to become focal points for cultural, creative and community activities throughout Ireland.</p><p>In addition, in 2021, my Department supported Other Voices to deliver a series of on line concerts as part of a programme entitled Courage.These included concerts at Kilkenny Castle, Kilruddery House, Swords Castle, Glenveagh National Park and Muckross House. While the primary objective of this programme was to support artists and promote wellbeing during the Covid pandemic, these concerts reached a large international audience and had the ancillary benefit of promoting Ireland's built heritage globally. </p></reply>

The media sector in Ireland, which is a vital element of our democracy and society as a whole, is undergoing fundamental change.</p>  <p>  The local media sector has faced a fall in revenue arising from COVID-19, but also faces longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue to online services.</p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including the NewsBrands Ireland, Local Ireland, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ). </p>  <p>  In relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial radio sector and met with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI).</p>  <p>  Support for the production of audiovisual and audio content for Irish audiences is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme, which is established under the Broadcasting Act 2009 and administered by the BAI. The Scheme is funded through the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts per annum.</p>  <p>  - under section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, I as Minister may allocate additional Exchequer funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme. In this regard, I recently announced &euro;10.5 million in additional funding to the Scheme, which will support programming on both radio and television. This additional funding has been allocated as follows:</p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for climate change and climate action content production;</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 million for live music broadcasting productions;</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 million for Irish language programming; and,</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million extra for general Sound and Vision scheme projects</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to putting in place a framework which will enable a sustainable future for a vibrant, diverse and independent media sector, encompassing print, audiovisual, radio and online.</p>  <p>  A key element in this was the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, which was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith. The Commission's task was a complex one, with a remit to address the many issues of concern for the entire media industry. As a result, the Commission&rsquo;s report and the wide ranging recommendations it contains have required careful and detailed thought.</p>  <p>  The detailed consideration of the Future of Media Commission&rsquo;s report by An Taoiseach, myself and other key Ministers is nearing conclusion, and it will be brought to Government for consideration in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  As regards the regulation of online services and audiovisual media, the Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill 2022, which is currently at Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will establish a multi-person Media Commission (to be known as Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n), dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), and establish frameworks for the regulation of audiovisual media services and online safety. This will include the regulation of video sharing platforms and designated online services.  Upon its establishment, An Coimisi&uacute;n will fulfil the role currently played by the BAI in licensing sound broadcasting services such as local radio stations. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.635.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000073#WRN00400"><p>With regard to the sectors covered by my Department, there is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a huge challenge to the survival and recovery of many businesses and enterprises. In the tourism, arts, culture and sports sectors, in particular, many businesses and organisations were not able to operate, or could only operate in a limited way, for large parts of the past two years.</p><p>The support environment put in place by me and my colleagues in Government has meant that the vast majority of businesses have survived the pandemic and are now in a position to recover. Horizontal supports such as the EWSS and the CRSS have been instrumental in helping businesses across the economy to retain employees and cover costs. In the sectors I oversee, dedicated supports have complemented the horizontal measures and have reflected the particular challenges faced by these sectors. </p><p>The Government's careful management of the pandemic over the past two years has meant that we were able to remove all restrictions on the economy and society earlier this year. Notwithstanding this, in recognition of the particular challenges faced by the sectors I oversee, a number of dedicated supports have been maintained or introduced this year to assist the recovery in those sectors worst affected, for example:</p><p>In <b>Tourism</b>, I secured an additional &euro;50 million for the Tourism Business Continuity Schemes for 2022. These schemes are managed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and will support businesses across the tourism sectors that need it most urgently, taking account of the Government funding that has already been received and the wider context of the horizontal supports provided by Government. To date under the 2022 Tourism Business Continuity Schemes, 367 payments have been made amounting to &euro;21.7 million with a further 429 applications being evaluated. All schemes are expected to be completed by the end of June 2022.</p><p>A number of schemes have also been made available to support the recovery in the <b>Arts and Culture</b>sector this year. </p><p>- The &euro;15m Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme (LPRGS) is a new grant for businesses engaged in staging live events in the arts and culture live performance sector. The scheme, which opened in March 2022, aims to de-risk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022 and to assist with the costs of reopening. </p><p>- The Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme 2022 (CECGS 2022) has a funding allocation of &euro;5 million to support the commercial arts sector. Grants will be paid to successful applicants as a contribution to the capital costs associated with reopening after closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>- The pilot Basic Income Scheme for the Arts has recently opened. This scheme will examine, over a 3 year period, the impact of a basic income on artists and creative arts workers. Payments of &euro;325 per week will be made to 2,000 eligible artists and creative arts workers who will be selected at random and invited to take part. </p><p>- In December 2021, I launched the Live Performance Support Scheme 3 (LPSS3) to support events planned for December and January. </p><p>- An additional &euro;5m of funding was allocated to local authorities for the 2022 Local Live Performance Support Scheme (LLPSS). The aim of the scheme is to help underpin the recovery of the live performance sector at a local level.</p><p>- As part of the &euro;50m in supports for 2022 for the Live Entertainment sector, &euro;4m was allocated to the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) in 2022. These MEBAS 2022 grants will be paid for six months, January 2022 to June 2022, similar to the supports being offered under broader Live Entertainment LPSS supports. </p><p>In December 2021, almost &euro;80m was allocated for the <b>Sport </b>sector under two separate support programmes. Of this, &euro;73.6m funding is being provided under five separate streams to help sports organisations to recover and grow post-pandemic, support our grassroots networks of clubs and local sports partnerships, and ensure that people of all ages and abilities return to sport and physical activity.  The timing of the schemes provides stability and certainty to the sports sector for 2022 as it emerges from Covid-19 restrictions. In addition, &euro;5.3m was allocated to National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) and Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) for the provision of sports equipment including the roll out of defibrillators for clubs, sport kits for school children and state of the art equipment for high performance athletes. This significant investment built on the extensive support package of &euro;88.5m provided in 2020 to address the COVID-19 challenges to the sport sector. </p><p>Insofar as <b>Gaeltacht</b>regions are concerned, my Department recently initiated three specific measures in further support of the Irish summer colleges sector, post COVID-19. Key measures include increased funding under the Departments&rsquo;s Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge -  payable to qualifying Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to students attending accredited Gaeltacht summer colleges, in addition to an increased allocation of 350 scholarships (over the 2019 allocation) to support students of DEIS post-primary schools in availing of Gaeltacht summer college courses. The overall additional funding of c. &euro;800,000 being provided in relation to these measures inter alia represents the largest increase in investment in support of the Irish summer colleges sector in a single year since the scheme was first introduced in 1972.  </p><p>In recognition of COVID-19 impacts on the <b>Broadcasting</b>sector, I secured additional funding for the Sound and Vision scheme which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. In order to continue to support the sector as we emerge from COVID-19, I recently announced a further, additional allocation of &euro;10.5m in Sound and Vision funding for 2022. This includes &euro;5m for climate change and climate action content production, which is being co-funded with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. This was in addition to the almost &euro;7 million extra allocated to the scheme between 2020 and 2021 and on top of the statutory allocation of 7% of net TV licence fee receipts which normally supports Sound and Vision. </p></reply>

Underlying the Plan is the conviction that creativity and culture should be at the heart of education for all our young people. The Creative Youth Plan sets out measures designed to enable the creative potential of every young person, both within the formal education system and in informal or community settings.  </p>  <p>  The Plan is implemented by my Department in partnership with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Arts Council. Progress on the delivery of its objectives to date has included the roll-out of a number of schools-based initiatives allowing culture, creativity and the arts flourish in the education system. </p>  <p>  Creative Schools, delivered by the Arts Council, has supported 652 schools develop and implement their own creative plan, while strengthening the relationships between schools and the broader cultural and community infrastructure. Creative Clusters, delivered by my colleague Minister Foley, enables groups of up to five schools to collaborate on an innovative arts and creative project to address a common issue or challenge (almost 300 schools to date). In 2021, Minister Foley announced a new initiative developed by the Department of Education, titled BLAST (Bringing Live Arts to Schools and Teachers), which enabled over 480 new Arts-in-Education residencies in schools in its first year. Creative Youth also provides funding support for Creative Engagement grants operated by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  </p>  <p>  Creative Youth has seen my department form partnerships to further enrich creative and cultural engagement in schools. Collaborating with Sing Ireland, the YouthSing Ireland programme developed high quality interactions with musicians, online performance activities and educational resources for young people. This included a specific set of songs and resources in Irish or of Irish cultural heritage designed for use in formal and informal settings. The Big Idea, in partnership with the Institute of Designers in Ireland, works with students to address problems and issues through creative problem solving and design thinking.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department provides ongoing financial support for a number of initiatives which support language learning and enrichment opportunities in Gaeltacht schools via the traditional arts and sports. This further underpins the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the policy on Gaeltacht education as key drivers of government&rsquo;s overarching 5-Year Action Plan for the Irish language (Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022). </p>  <p>  Under my Department&rsquo;s Community and Language Support Programme, funding is provided to support Gaeltacht-based organisations to deliver agreed work programmes in the domains of the traditional arts (Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta) and sports (Cl&aacute;r na gCluich&iacute; Gaelacha). Both of these programmes are largely delivered through the network of schools in Gaeltacht regions.</p>  <p>  While my Department continues to support the initiatives referenced above in a collaborative manner across Government, primary responsibility for Irish culture as part of the school curriculum rests with my colleague, Minister Foley.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,100 applications were submitted.  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. This represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.</p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were invited to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. Of the record &euro;150 million made available for capital projects, &euro;6 million has been kept in reserve for any successful appeals. The preliminary assessment of all appeals has now been complete and it is hoped to announce consequent allocations shortly.</p>  <p>  Once the appeal process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.</p></reply>

It provides funding to Paralympics Ireland to support its administration and operational costs. Sport Ireland also provides High Performance Programme funding to Paralympics Ireland to support the delivery of its para programme, which supports Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European Championships, World Championships, and the Paralympic Games. Sport Ireland has provided significant investment to disabled (para) athletes who compete in performance level sport.</p><p>The Government's long-standing commitment to para sport is evident in the amount of funding allocated for the most recent Tokyo Cycle, 2017-2020, whereby Sport Ireland invested &euro;2.7 million into Paralympics Ireland&rsquo;s High Performance Programme. The Sport Ireland High Performance Strategy 2021-2032 sets out the long-term vision for the high performance system.

The Local Authority provides a nomination, within one month of being notified by the AHB.</p>  <p>  Payments are made to the AHB for a maximum period of 3 consecutive months from date of availability in order to allow for tenanting of the dwelling. For P&amp;A-CALF properties, this period can be extended by one additional month where the housing authority has not provided a nomination within one month of being notified of the vacancy. If the dwelling remains vacant at the end of the 3-month period and has not been withdrawn from the scheme, it is deemed to be inactive and notified to my Department.

With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment. Then, intensive work continues on these issues once they are housed. Housing First has been a key element of Government homelessness policy.</p>  <p>  The Housing First approach to addressing homelessness places direct access to housing first and foremost for vulnerable individuals using homeless services consistently or intermittently over long periods of time, and those unable or resistant to accessing homeless services and who may then become habitual rough sleepers. These individuals often have complex high support needs such as mental or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnosis (the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction).</p>  <p>  Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. Housing First service providers assess rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation for suitability for Housing First and if they meet the criteria they are supported to access Housing First units. These criteria are further outlined in the Housing First Manual for Ireland, which was written by Dr Sam Tsemberis, the originator of the Housing First concept. This Manual is available at www.housingagency.ie/sites/default/files/A_HOUSING_FIRST_MANUAL_IRELAND.pdf </p>  <p>  The first National Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, which put the programme on a national footing, was designed to provide this response, by delivering permanent housing solutions and associated supports for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation. It extended the delivery of Housing First nationally and included an overall target of 663 tenancies for the period 2018-2021. By this Plan's conclusion a total of 756 Housing First tenancies had been created. </p>  <p>  Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The new Plan outlines the targets for each region and in each year. The Plan is available at assets.gov.ie/211822/f696f832-6100-4ef4-b75f-cde874caca06.pdf </p>  <p>  The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the criminal justice sector (the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service) and Local Authorities, in conjunction with NGO partners. Each partner is committing the necessary resources and supports to implement the programme.</p>  <p>  A new National Directorate for the Housing First programme has been put in place, based in The Housing Agency. It will manage programme delivery. Governance and oversight is effected through a National Implementation Group which consists of representatives from the partners to the programme.</p></reply>

The Local Authority Home Loan is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.

The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. </p>  <p>  Single applicants for properties in counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath or Wicklow must not be earning greater than &euro;65,000 annual gross income or &euro;50,000 annual gross income for properties in all other counties in the Republic of Ireland.

The applicant must be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings. It should be noted that a return to solvency should not be interpreted as a return to creditworthiness, which is a separate assessment.</p>  <p>  In recognition of such instances, an exemption to the First Time Buyer eligibility criteria can be applied under the Fresh Start Principle.</p>  <p>  The final decision regarding the Local Authority Home Loan application is made by the relevant Local Authority Credit Committee on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Further details can be found on www.localauthorityhomeloan.ie/</p></reply>

These homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and participating retail banks (the First Home shared equity scheme).  </p>  <p>  The first 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021 at least 40% below comparable open-market prices. Funding from the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) supported the delivery of 50 Cost Rental homes that were tenanted last month in Woodside, Enniskerry Road, Stepaside. Tenants have been selected by AHBs for a further 4 Cost Rental schemes due for delivery in the coming months, with further developments due later in the year.</p>  <p>  Affordable purchase homes supported by the AHF, will be made available in Boherboy, Cork City this May, with indicated prices of &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. Applications recently closed for 16 Affordable Purchase homes in Kilcarbery Grange, a South Dublin County Council supported affordable purchase development. Indicated costs for these homes are between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300. This will be followed by Dun Emer in Lusk, a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development with indicated costs of &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings. These homes are being made available at rates which are c. 20% below market norms.</p>  <p>  The First Home scheme will employ an equity stake model to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes on the private market in the years 2022 to 2025. The scheme will be jointly established and governed with participating mortgage lenders (primarily pillar retail banks). The overall anticipated spending for the scheme is &euro;400m, funded on a 50:50 basis by the State and participating mortgage lenders. The current schedule anticipates a launch of the First Home scheme website in early June, with a full scheme deployment shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  Project Tosaigh was also announced through the Housing for All strategy. Under this initiative, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency, who will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently in the process of finalising agreements with prospective proposers for the initial tranche of affordable homes delivered through this initiative.</p>  <p>  The CSO Wholesale Price Index shows the annual increase for building and construction materials to be 16.9% to the end of March 2022. Construction costs have risen considerably over recent years through a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits that the Government and relevant State agencies will advance methods to reduce residential construction costs, particularly the cost of apartment construction, by increasing the focus of existing and planned construction related initiatives on the residential construction sector, and by ensuring a coordinated, whole-of-government, approach to residential construction.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government will enhance the intended role of the new Construction Technology Centre, which is under development by Enterprise Ireland, beyond the standard remit of Technology Centres in general for its first three years of operation in order to prioritise residential construction, in particular by incorporating:</p>  <p>  - structures and funding to enable innovation in residential construction prior to the National Standards Authority of Ireland compliance processes, including demonstration, certification, standardisation and commercialisation as well as research and development;</p>  <p>  - a proactive role in strengthening the residential construction value chain;</p>  <p>  - promotion, development and support for innovation / modern methods of construction (MMCs) using digital and manufacturing technology;</p>  <p>  - support for SMEs to develop scale and to adopt MMCs and Building Information Modelling techniques for residential construction; and</p>  <p>  - support for digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction e.g. digitally controlled manufacturing equipment.</p>  <p>  This will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector. This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to temper price inflation.</p>  <p>  In addition the CSG supported by my Department are also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost (including cost of compliance) and increasing standardisation. It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government departments and industry.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Government policy, social and affordable housing construction projects (as with all publicly funded construction projects), must be procured in accordance with the Capital Works Management Framework. The Office of Government (OGP) is responsible for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly in relation to construction procurement.</p>  <p>  The OGP continues to review the situation and introduced the following interim measures last year to address the impact that price increases in construction materials is having on public works tenders:</p>  <p>  - Reduced fixed price period duration to 24 months (previously 30 months minimum).</p>  <p>  - Permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15% (previously 50%)</p>  <p>  - Introduction of a new mechanism to address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price</p>  <p>  The above measures relate to new public works contracts going forward.</p></reply>

In 2021, the number of deeds lodged with the Registry of Deeds increased by 9 per cent, and the number processed increased by 20 per cent. Some 4,518 copy memorial applications were received during 2021 and issued within 1 to 3 working days from the date of receipt. The number of official searches undertaken during 2021 was 1,400, which was 113 per cent more than in 2020. Some 99 per cent of regular searches are processed within 1 to 3 working days.</p>  <p>  Public access to pre-1970 records at the Registry of Deeds Henrietta Street building was suspended on 11 March 2020. However, public access by appointment re-opened on 10 August 2020.  In line with Government guidelines, public access was again suspended in November 2020 during 'Level 5' of the Government&rsquo;s Living with Covid-19 Plan and also between January and May 2021. However, the appointment service re-commenced on 11 May 2021, with data indicating that there is a sufficient number of appointments to meet customer demand. It should also be noted that Registry of Deeds staff continued to undertake searches and provide certified copies throughout the pandemic disruption.</p>  <p>  The public counter service for post-1970 public searches was closed on 11 March 2020. These records have been computerised and access to them is available via www.landdirect.ie. PRA staff also provide an enhanced response to queries by e-mail and phone to assist customers in navigating landdirect.ie. A postal and e-mail search service is also provided for customers not wishing to open a landdirect account. In addition, a new e-mail service for 'plain' (non-certified) copies of documents was introduced in June 2020. It is also intended to provide an in-person service for post-1970 public searches on an appointment basis in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The PRA Chancery Street Office is open to receive applications to register deeds in the Registry of Deeds, lodged by hand.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister's power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions should not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned. I am, therefore, precluded from intervening in relation to individual cases.</p>  <p>  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure consistency of treatment for all applicants.</p></reply>

The Midland Retrofit Programme was established as a pilot programme to provide learnings on the move to 'deeper retrofit', to trial the aggregation concept and provide economic stimulus to the counties most affected by the cessation of peat harvesting for electricity generation. It centred therefore on upgrading larger batches of homes in distinct, compact geographical areas. </p>  <p>  The Midlands Retrofit Programme experienced significant delays due to the effects of COVID-19 and other obstacles including tendering and supply chain issues particularly concerning Heat Pumps, Windows &amp;amp; Doors, and Insulation.  Notwithstanding these challenges, local authorities undertook a lot of the preparatory work on the Programme in 2020 and in 2021 brought their targeted units to tender and commencement stage.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 146 properties  were completed under the Midlands Retrofit Programme.  A breakdown of the funding provided and number of properties upgraded under the  Programme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link. </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/b86b3-midlands-energy-retrofit-programme-expenditure-and-units/</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the remaining units targeted under the programme will be completed this year and statistics in relation to 2022 will be available in early 2023. This will conclude the MRP Pilot Programme as the newly revised Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme is available across all 31 local authorities since 2021.</p></reply>

The full text of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 is available from the following link: www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/act/25/enacted/en/html</p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme has already seen new homes made available by Local Authorities for purchase by eligible applicants. This includes locations in Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin South County Dublin and Dun Emer in Lusk, Fingal.  Under the scheme, homes are made available at significant reductions on market prices based on an eligible buyer's purchasing ability.  The Local Authority will take a percentage equity stake in the home in recognition of the State support. The scheme is primarily targeted at First Time Buyers, though Section 10 of the Affordable Housing Act sets provisions for eligibility exceptions for the scheme, which are part of the Government's 'Fresh Start' strategy as detailed in the <i>Housing for All</i>strategy. Broadly, the provisions include an exception for those who previously purchased or constructed a home with a spouse or partner but who are now divorced or legally separated or whose relationship has ended, or who have undergone an insolvency process, and who now have no financial interest in the previous home.</p><p>The First Home Scheme will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in Local Authority Affordable Purchase. The scheme aims to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026. First Home will only support purchases of homes within regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by First Time Buyers in the area, so the scheme is targeted at the lower region of the market. Like the Local Authority scheme, First Home is primarily targeted at First Time Buyers, with certain exemptions. The intention is to mirror the 'Fresh Start' provisions of the Local Authority scheme for people who are divorced or separated or whose relationship has ended, or have undergone insolvency, and who now have no financial interest in the previous home. It is intended that full details of the First Home Scheme will be available online on a dedicated website in June in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s deployment shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and now incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The maximum income threshold for joint applications is &euro;75,000 in all counties. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property. The maximum market values are &euro;320,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country.  The Local Authority Home Loan can be used to purchase a home under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme.

It commits to an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report &quot;Safe as Houses?&quot;. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment</p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.<ol type="1"><li>Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</li><li>Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</li></ol>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>1. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>1. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>2. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>3. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. </p><p>The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation are informing the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and are supporting the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid.</p>  <p>  Following on from the successful roll out of the Covid vaccine programme and the reopening of society, the normal DMP was reinstated from 6 September 2021. </p>  <p>  Tenants that incurred arrears during the Covid-19 emergency were given additional time to engage with the HAP Debt Management Unit to clear their arrears, as well as access to payment plans as a specific Covid measure. Under the normal HAP DMP payment plans are not offered or available to tenants at this stage of the process. The HAP SSC have now resumed the standard debt management process.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund, formerly the Serviced Sites Fund. The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh. </p>  <p>  Approval in principle was confirmed for approximately 900 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme over the period 2021-2023. The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to a number of these projects are being completed by the AHBs concerned. When these arrangements are concluded, full details of the projects, including specific locations, housing typologies and cost-covering rents, will be made public. As matters stand, addition to the 65 delivered in 2021, AHBs have indicated that over 500 of these homes approved for CREL funding will be delivered in 2022 with the remainder due for completion in 2023. </p>  <p>  The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices. </p>  <p>  This year, tenants have been selected by the Tuath AHB for 44 Cost Rental homes at Parklands, Citywest. These are two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom duplexes, with starting cost rents projected to range from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300, representing a discount of approximately 30% on comparable market rents in the area.</p>  <p>  A further 74 Cost Rental units will be completed by the Tuath AHB at Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin this year and an additional 16 Cost Rental units will be tenanted by Cl&uacute;id at the Barnhall Meadows project in Leixlip, Co. Kildare. The first phases of schemes in Newcastle, Dublin and in Newbridge, Co. Kildare will see a further 57 new homes completed in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) supported affordable housing delivery, 50 Cost Rental homes were tenanted last month in Woodside, Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, with rents with approximately 40% below open-market rates for comparable homes in that area.</p>  <p>  Local Authority Affordable Purchase homes supported by the AHF will be made available shortly at Boherboy Road in Cork City this month, where 22 two and three-bed dwellings are expected to be delivered at discounts of up to 20% on market value with homes being made available from &euro;218,000 to &euro;243,000. A further 15 units are scheduled to be completed at Boherboy by year end. Cork City Council have also indicated that they will deliver 36 Affordable Purchase homes in Cluain Chaoin, Tower in two phases this year.</p>  <p>  39 Affordable Purchase homes will also be delivered at Dun Emer in Lusk, Co Dublin by Fingal County Council in two phases this year. These two and three bed dwellings are expected to be delivered at an average discount of 25% on market values, ranging in price from &euro;166,000 to &euro;258,000. </p>  <p>  In addition, South Dublin County Council recently advertised 16 Affordable Purchase homes in Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin all to be delivered this year, which will cost between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300.</p>  <p>  Waterford City and County Council also expect to deliver Affordable Purchase homes at a development in Mount Neil, Carrickphierish by the end of 2022. In addition, a further development at Summerfields, Kilbarry is expected to deliver its first phase in 2022.

Expenditure does not generally arise in an even pattern throughout the year, and is dependent on the expected drawdown based on matters such as vouched expenditure, projects reaching milestones and completions etc. Profiles are set at the start of the year based on the prevailing circumstances and variances may arise over the course of the year.</p><p>The variance of expenditure from profile at the end of April arises from lower than anticipated expenditure across a small number of specific expenditure lines in the Housing Programme as a result of a combination of factors including: fewer than expected claims from Local Authorities, an element of expenditure being offset by Local Authorities against their Local Property Tax (LPT) receipts and the expenditure of capital carryover following the earlier than anticipated signing of the Deferred Surrender Order. Capital Carryover expenditure was due to commence in April however the Deferred Surrender Order was signed earlier than anticipated on 22 February and this has impacted the expenditure-profile variance.  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Housing Programme has a Gross Capital provision of &euro;2.25 billion in 2022 &ndash; representing an increase of some &euro;419 million on the Estimate for 2021. An additional &euro;78.55m from LPT receipts will also be used by certain Local Authorities to fund housing programmes. A further &euro;247.3m capital carried over from 2021 is allocated to the Housing Programme, bringing the total Gross Capital provision in 2022 to almost &euro;2.6 billion. </p><p>My Department reports to Government on a quarterly basis on Capital expenditure. The report examines capital expenditure to date compared to profile identifying key areas where spending is either above or below profile; outlook for the year taking into account the impact of Covid-19 and other emerging challenges on programmes and projects; and measures required to mitigate any significant risks.  The report for the first Quarter 2022 will be brought to Government shortly. </p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, the regulations will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country,  with limited restriction zones around airports. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The formal SEA process commenced on 28 April 2022 with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report. Following this statutory process, the SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence in the coming weeks. A copy of the draft regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft regulation. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  While these regulations are being advanced, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed restriction zones around airports.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. </p>  <p>  Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. Social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p>  <p>  - One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p>  <p>  - Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p>  <p>  - Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have not been assigned individual acquisition targets under Housing for All. Priority acquisitions will be supported by my Department, including acquisitions of properties that support households to exit or prevent homelessness. In April, I reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions. The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy. </p></reply>

It contains the objectives, policies and supporting actions which the Government considers necessary to support the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.</p>  <p>  The NMPF includes a detailed section on fisheries (section 16) and a series of policies on fisheries, which will inform the assessment of all planning applications in the maritime area. Any proposal that may have a significant adverse impact must demonstrate how it will, in order of preference, (a) avoid, (b) minimise or (c) mitigate any such impact. These measures will have to be addressed in the planning application and will be assessed by the relevant planning authority. </p>  <p>  The NMPF will be the key consideration for assessing applications for marine authorisations and making a balanced decision, taking into account the various marine activities, including fisheries. All applications for development will be considered in terms of their consistency with the objectives of the plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Maritime Planning Act 2021 facilitates public consultation on applications for development in the maritime area. This allows those with fishing interests to make submissions on applications for development. The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended) require planning authorities to give notice of valid planning applications to certain prescribed bodies where the development would be relevant to the functions of that body. Reports prepared by prescribed bodies and submitted to the relevant planning authorities are considered as part of the assessment of the planning application. My officials are preparing secondary legislation, which will address the identification of prescribed bodies for maritime applications. </p>  <p>  In addition, the setting up of a Seafood/Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) working group is at an advanced stage. This will assist the managed introduction of the offshore renewables industry into the maritime area.  The initial stated aim of the working group will be to agree a communications protocol between these two strategically important maritime sectors.</p>  <p>  The position of chairperson to this group was recently advertised and attracted strong interest from a broad range of suitably qualified candidates. My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, conducted a shortlisting process and subsequently interviewed the shortlisted candidates. I expect a recommendation from my officials as to the nomination for chairperson in the coming days and I will then move to appoint the chairperson as a matter of priority, with the aim of holding the inception meeting of the Seafood/ORE working group at the earliest available opportunity.</p></reply>

Ireland strongly supports all efforts to restore the JCPOA, and in this context we have engaged extensively with Iran to encourage them to seize the opportunity of agreement. I have visited Tehran twice for discussions with the President and Foreign Minister, most recently in February 2022. </p>  <p>  We have also discussed regional issues which feature heavily on the agenda of the Security Council. This includes Yemen, where I have encouraged Iran to use its influence to support UN led efforts towards peace, and the crisis in Afghanistan, which has significantly impacted Iran, which hosts millions of Afghan refugees. </p>  <p>  In our discussions with Iran we have also raised concerns over human rights, including freedom of expression, the use of the death penalty, and discrimination against women and religious minorities, including the Baha&rsquo;i. </p>  <p>  Ireland intends to pursue this important dialogue.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.861.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000076#WRQ03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 407, 429 and 439 together.</p>  <p>The Passport Service is proactively managing the current demand for passports and has put in place resources and structures to address the estimated significant increase in demand for passports in 2022 in this essential citizen service.</p>  <p>  A Passport Service communications campaign was deployed at the start of the year with the objective of informing the public about the passport application process and to encourage citizens to go online for applications and renewals. This campaign ran over print, broadcast and digital mediums, as well as stadium, event and airport advertising. It included advertisements in national and local radio, as well as advertisements in national press, during a two week period in January. Further activity is planned for the second half of the year across digital, social media, print and radio. </p>  <p>  Since late January, all Passport Service sites in Dublin and Cork have been operating at full capacity following the ending of many Covid-19 public health restrictions, and all services have fully resumed as they were in place before the pandemic. The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to book a counter appointment and renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin and within 4 days in Cork. </p>  <p>  There are currently 183,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p>  <p>  Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  -  30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)</p>  <p>  -  8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  In addition, 45% of adult renewal online applications are issued within one to two working days of receipt.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has recently reduced the turnaround time for first time applications from 40 working days to 30 working days. This is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services: </p>  <p>  - The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022. </p>  <p>  - A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021. </p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.  </p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications. </p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard. </p>  <p>  - In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. </p>  <p>  - A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants. </p>  <p>  - There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application. </p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

We believe that the Security Council has an important role to play, given the impact on national and regional peace and security.  Since the conflict began in November 2020, there have been 14 meetings of the Council on Ethiopia. Ireland has played a leading role on the Council, particularly in negotiating statements that, despite difficult dynamics, have achieved unanimous support in calling for unhindered humanitarian access, a ceasefire and a national dialogue. Ireland has also repeatedly raised the need for accountability for the widespread human rights abuses and atrocities that have been committed by all sides in the conflict.  </p>  <p>  Ethiopia was most recently discussed at the Security Council on 14 April, when the focus was on the humanitarian situation.  At that meeting, Ireland called for immediate implementation of the recently agreed humanitarian truce, and delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need.  </p>  <p>  Putting Ethiopia on the formal agenda of the Council would require support around the table, and the reality is that some current members of the Council do not want this. Despite these challenges, responding to the acute humanitarian crisis in Tigray and Ethiopia more generally will remain an urgent priority for Ireland during our term on the Council and beyond. </p>  <p>  Minister Coveney continues to engage on the situation in Ethiopia with key interlocutors in the region including African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo. Minister Coveney also met with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen in February, and stressed the need for full humanitarian access and an end to hostilities; restoration of basic services; and political dialogue. We continue to advocate for an effective response to the situation through a full range of regular and ongoing contacts with Ethiopia, including in Addis Ababa, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, as well as in EU forums in Brussels.  </p>  <p>  The publication on 3 November of the findings of the joint investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in Tigray was a vital first step towards accountability. I look forward to full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and progress on investigations. Ireland also supports the decision of the Human Rights Council in December to establish an international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia and welcomes the recent appointment of the members of the Commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.899.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000076#WRQ07500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395, 396, 397 and 398 together.</p><p>The Passport Service does not maintain records of passport applications that have been expedited. </p><p>The Passport Service has a dedicated Travel Emergency team that work to expedite passport applications in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. </p><p>In these cases, if the application is fully complete and has all required supporting documentation, the Passport Service will aim to issue the passport to the applicant in a matter of days, whilst still carrying out all the necessary checks to ensure that the integrity of the Irish passport is maintained. </p><p>If the Passport Service becomes aware of an application that has passed its estimated issue by date or has experienced delays due to an error on the side of the Passport Service, the Passport Service will prioritise the application to ensure that no further delays are experienced by the applicant. </p><p>The vast majority of applications are processed within the turnaround times outlined below:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>The Passport Service has recently reduced the average turnaround time for first time applications from 40 working days to 30 working days. This reduction in processing time is as a direct result of the staffing and resources my Department has invested in the Passport Service. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this processing time even further in the coming months. </p><p>The Passport Service has received 100,000 first time applications since the beginning of this year. The Passport Service has issued 70,000 first time passports since the beginning of this year. </p><p>The average turnaround time for first time applications received prior to 7<sup></sup>March 2022 was 40 working days. First time applications received after this date had an average turnaround time of 35 working days, until 19 April when the average turnaround time for first time applications received from that date was reduced to 30 working days.  Therefore, all first time applications received prior to 19 April will have anturnaround time of greater than 30 days. </p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. Out of a total of 183,000 passport applications currently with the Passport Service, 88,000 or 48% are for first time applications. Approximately, half of all first time applications are for children.</p><p>37,700 or 43% of current first time applications are incomplete. This means that the applicant has either not sent any documentation after they apply online or additional documentation has been requested by the Passport Service. The Passport Service simply cannot process applications that are not complete.</p><p>There is a rigorous checking process in place for first time applications. The Passport Service must ensure the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and their guardians.  </p><p>Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures involved by highly trained and experienced staff, first time passport applications currently take 30 working days to process. In more complex cases, unfortunately, it can take longer.</p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p><p>Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.  In addition to this, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels to meet the expected demand in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.</p><p>It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applications in 2022. Along with increased staffing, the Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service: </p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications. </p><p>- Passport Service staff are working overtime with a focus on prioritising first time applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. </p><p>- A new document management process has been put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. </p><p>My Department is confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p></reply>

A major element of the assistance provided was the repatriation of Irish citizens from around the world. In 2020, for example, my Department assisted more than 8,000 citizens to return to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Informed by the particular circumstances of the pandemic, my Department now has in place a comprehensive approach to supporting, where appropriate, significant groups of Irish citizens requiring repatriation from overseas in crisis situations. In general, citizen repatriation is facilitated through commercial flight options while these remain available.  The second preference is to help facilitate citizen repatriation through charter flights operated by EU partners &ndash; under the EU&rsquo;s Civil Protection Mechanism &ndash; or by other international partners.  As a last resort, where no other options are available and where specified conditions are met, my Department may explore the chartering of an aircraft to facilitate stranded citizens to return to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Where citizens are carried on flights chartered by the Government or by EU or other international partners, every effort is made to ensure that fares are set at a reasonable level and that passengers are billed in advance of travel.  Citizens who it has been established do not have the means to pay in advance of travel, may be repatriated on the basis of an undertaking to repay the relevant costs at a subsequent time.  Detailed procedures to oversee the recoupment of funds are in place.</p>  <p>  On 4 December 2021, in exceptional circumstances, my Department arranged for a charter flight to assist 156 people to return to Ireland from Morocco, following the suspension by the Moroccan authorities of regular commercial flights.  In January 2022, an internal review of that operation was conducted and a number of policy recommendations were made for the operation of future repatriation charter flights arranged by the Government.  My Department will keep its approach in this area under review to ensure that the policies and protocols in place continue to provide the appropriate consular assistance to Irish citizens who find themselves stranded overseas while also ensuring robust procedures are in place to manage Government funds.</p>  <p>  My Department does not generally offer financial assistance to Irish citizens stranded overseas.  In individual cases where it has been established that a citizen cannot access funds for one reason or another, a procedure is in place for the advance of funds through our embassy network to facilitate the return of the citizen to Ireland.

The Government takes a holistic approach to this relationship; our trade relationship with China is not considered separately from our values and priorities including in relation to human rights.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights remains a core pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. In the pursuit of our bilateral relations, the Government takes the full breadth of Ireland's values and interests into account. We will remain alert to situations of concern as they arise.</p>  <p>  In this context, Ireland frequently raises issues of concern, including regarding the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, with the Chinese government directly and in appropriate multilateral fora. Ireland remains deeply concerned about the evidence-based reports of human rights abuses and violations in Xinjiang. I raised these concerns when I met my Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in China last May. We have most recently raised our concerns at the 49th United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2022, including in a national statement, and in the UN Third Committee on Human Rights in October 2021. I am pleased to hear confirmation that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet will travel to China and will visit Xinjiang. This needs to be a transparent mission, with unfettered access. </p>  <p>  Ireland has strong trade figures with China. In 2020, total bilateral trade (goods and services) was worth &euro;28.8 billion. Total trade in goods for the period January -December 2021 was worth &euro;20 billion. </p></reply>

As we have set out in the Programme for Government, we will work to ensure that the agreement is implemented in full. </p><p>I have remained in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to discuss progress with respect to the implementation of the NDNA, including most recently as part of recent British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) that took place at the end of March. The next BIIGC is scheduled to take place in June. </p><p>For our part, the Government published a series of commitments, at the time of NDNA, focused on working with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. Although Covid 19 has been the understandable focus in the time since the NDNA was reached, nevertheless progress has been made to implement those important commitments.</p><p>The package of language and identity legislation agreed in New Decade New Approach was detailed and balanced and should be implemented without delay &ndash; as should all the commitments in NDNA. This would have been better done in the Assembly as intended but there is no reason for further delay or deadlock over the positive measures agreed in support of linguistic diversity and cultural expression in Northern Ireland. It should be advanced on the basis of the legislative provisions negotiated, agreed and published at the time of NDNA.  I look forward to seeing progress on this legislation in Westminster as soon as possible, as committed to by the Secretary of State.</p><p>As part of the NDNA, it was also agreed that there would be regular review meetings involving the two Governments at Ministerial level and the parties to monitor progress on its implementation, and the delivery of commitments by each Government.  On 11 January 2021, I participated in the first Implementation Review Meeting alongside the First Minister, deputy First Minister, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and party leaders in Northern Ireland. It is regrettable that a second review meeting has not been able to take place to date; however, it is hoped that a second review meeting can take place in the period ahead.</p><p>Of course, Assembly Elections have just taken place and the formation of an Executive is now the important focus for the parties, and we will continue to work in full support of the institutions. The full implementation of the NDNA is a key priority for the Government in the period ahead, and we will work with a new Executive and the British Government to this end. The agreement reached in NDNA will also shape our approach to getting the institutions up and running.  We will also work to ensure a resumption of full and regular meetings of the North South Ministerial Council as part of these efforts.</p></reply>

Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can deliver peace, in line with international humanitarian law as well as international human rights norms and standards, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.</p><p>I witnessed with my own eyes the shocking aftermath of the devastation in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. I expressed to the Mayor of Bucha, Mr. Anatoliy Fedoruk, the sincere condolences of the Irish Government and people. I committed to bearing witness to these terrible atrocities and to raising the situation internationally. Those who perpetrated these heinous crimes must be brought to justice.</p><p>On 19 April, as I promised to the mayor of Bucha and Foreign Minister Kuleba, I briefed the UN Security Council on my visit to Ukraine. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers. At the UN Security Council, I was clear that these facts speak to an utter disregard by Russian forces for their clear and unambiguous obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians. Ireland will continue to use our membership on the UN Security Council to hold Russia accountable for its actions.</p><p>Ireland is one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is providing a further &euro;3 million to the ICC. Investigation teams from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC are already actively collecting evidence from Ukraine. </p><p>On 4 May, the European Commission presented proposals for a sixth package of sanctions aimed at depriving Russia and Belarus of the ability to wage war on Ukraine.  The package will include additional listings of individuals and entities, including high-ranking military officers and other individuals deemed to have been involved in committing atrocities in Bucha and in the siege of the city of Mariupol. The package also targets additional Russian and Belarussian banks, including Sberbank, Russia's largest bank. Three big Russian state-owned broadcasters responsible for Russian state propaganda will be sanctioned, and will be unable to distribute their content in any form in the EU or attract advertising.  The package also targets services, including accountancy, public relations and consultancy services to Russian companies.  </p><p>A complete import ban on all Russian oil is also proposed, to be introduced in an orderly fashion, it is hoped agreement can be reached soon to ensure that EU Member States can secure alternative supplies. Crude oil will be phased out within six months, and refined products such as petrol and diesel by the end of the year. There are also provisions to prevent Russia from diversifying its client base for oil products, including a ban on the provision of insurance and financing for the shipping of Russian oil.Ireland has allocated &euro;20 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, via the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN agencies. Additionally, at EU level, Ireland has contributed &euro;11.5m to an EU humanitarian assistance package of &euro;550m.</p><p>The EU is providing a &euro;1.5 billion package of European Peace Facility (EPF) support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Ireland is contributing its full share (&euro;33 million), which will go towards non-lethal elements only.</p><p>As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU Membership. We have come together with a group of other Member States, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.In February, the EU Council agreed a &euro;1.2 billion emergency macro-financial assistance package for Ukraine. Preparations for the swift disbursement of the second &euro;600 million tranche of this assistance are underway.</p><p>EU leaders agreed to develop a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund with a view to the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine, once the Russian onslaught has ceased.</p><p>Ireland has and will continue to play an active, constructive and compassionate role at EU level in meeting the challenges which arise from Russia's illegal military aggression.</p></reply>

The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in "Passport Express" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices and at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady and increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and Passport Express very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.</p>  <p>  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed almost 5,000 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p></reply>

Ukraine is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the ICC, but Article 12(3) of the Statute permits a state not party to the Statute to accept the jurisdiction of the ICC by lodging a declaration with the Registrar of the Court to that effect.  Ukraine lodged two separate declarations in April 2014 and September 2015 accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On 28 February 2022 ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to begin the process of opening a formal investigation into the situation in Ukraine. The Prosecutor had previously established that there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Crimea, and war crimes in Eastern Ukraine, since 2014. The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has, of course, drastically escalated the conflict beyond these areas.</p>  <p>  On 2 March 2022, Ireland joined a group of concerned States Parties to the Statute in referring the situation in Ukraine to the ICC.  The purpose of this referral was to remove the need for the Prosecutor to engage in a lengthy authorisation process before the Court&rsquo;s Pre-Trail Chamber which would otherwise have been required to investigate a situation in a country not a party to the Statute.</p>  <p>  The Prosecutor has now commenced investigation activities in Ukraine which are intended to lead to the prosecution at the ICC of individuals for the commission of international crimes, including war crimes. His office has deployed an investigation team to Ukraine to collect evidence and has established a dedicated portal through which any person who may hold information relevant to the Ukraine situation can contact ICC investigators.  He has also joined a Eurojust Joint Investigation Team together with the national prosecution authorities of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania to facilitate cooperation between them on their respective investigations into international crimes committed in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  By joining the referral of the situation in Ukraine to the ICC, Ireland has demonstrated its strong commitment to international justice as well as to accountability for atrocity crimes, including war crimes, arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its EU partners, has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC and will continue to support its important work. As part of our support for the Court, on 14 April I announced that Ireland will make a voluntary contribution of &euro;3 million to the ICC, with &euro;1 million to be distributed immediately to the Office of the Prosecutor.  This contribution will be used to benefit the ICC&rsquo;s work across all situation countries, not just Ukraine.</p></reply>

This report highlighted how Ireland uses its diplomatic, development and humanitarian tools, aligned with flexible funding models, to deliver results. It is this combined model that is being used to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s response to those most affected by Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The Irish Aid humanitarian response has focused on those who remain in Ukraine or in neighbouring countries, such as Moldova and Poland. In addition to a &euro;20 million Irish Aid humanitarian package which has been disbursed to organisations active on the ground in Ukraine or its immediate neighbours, prepositioned Irish Aid funds with key UN agencies, and the ICRC, meant that those organisations were able to respond on the ground in Ukraine immediately.  </p>  <p>  This funding complements the generous contributions made by so many citizens to Irish and other humanitarian organisations who are responding to the needs of those affected by the conflict, many of whom receive core funding from Irish Aid. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have activated the Rapid Response Register, with experts from the Register deploying to UN partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has called for Russia&rsquo;s immediate withdrawal of troops from the entire territory of Ukraine, demanded that the Russian Federation uphold its obligations under international law and encouraged the international community to provide all possible support to the Ukrainian people. On 5 May 2022, An Taoiseach participated in a pledging conference that raised &euro;6.15 billion in humanitarian and economic supports for Ukraine. Together the EU and its Member States have provided nearly &euro;1 billion in humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  Conscious of wider global humanitarian need, itself being affected by the invasion of Ukraine and its impact, for example, on world food prices, Irish Aid continues to respond generously to those most impacted by other crises, including Syria, Yemen and Somalia. Ireland hosted an Arria Formula meeting at the UNSC last month on Conflict and Hunger to draw international attention to the impact of the war in Ukraine on global food security and the need to continue to support other humanitarian crisis.</p></reply>

This will allow Ireland to maintain its longstanding focus on meeting the needs of people furthest behind, such as those affected by food insecurity and conflict.  Among the areas of focus this year are Ukraine, the Horn of Africa, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, as well as countries in the Sahel.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that our resources reach those in greatest need is central to our work and our ability to do so is well-recognised. In 2020, for example, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) highlighted Ireland as "an excellent humanitarian partner", with its funding models a "useful inspiration for other DAC donors", while respected international think-tank ODI found Ireland to be the most principled donor in its index.</p>  <p>  Ireland's ODA is delivered through multilateral organisations such as the UN, funding to Irish civil society organisations, as well as bilateral ODA spent through Irish Embassies abroad. Our funding is complemented by Ireland's political and diplomatic engagement, including now as a member of the UN Security Council. These complementary channels ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is directed to where it is needed most, in the most appropriate and effective way.</p></reply>

Our previous membership of the Council (2013-15) enabled us to contribute substantively to the promotion and protection of human rights. In order to continue this work, Ireland intends to seek our next term on the HRC for the period 2027 &ndash; 2029.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to ensuring that the UN is capable of continuous reform to adapt to emerging as well as to traditional global challenges, including in the field of human rights. We work closely with EU partners including the EU Special Representative on Human Rights, Mr Eamon Gilmore, to ensure that the Human Rights Council, Special Procedures, and the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies are continuously strengthened to ensure an effective response to human rights violations and abuses. </p>  <p>  The nature and scale of human rights cases under investigation by the UN varies from national Commissions of Inquiry to individual complaints to the Treaty Bodies. As such, consolidated figures on the number of cases are not available.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is a committed supporter of the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of a strong international criminal justice system. We are providing a &euro;3 million in funding which will assist with regard to all situations before the court. Currently, the Office of the Prosecutor is engaged in 17 investigations and 10 preliminary examinations across 25 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. As a result of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s investigations, there are currently 22 cases against 29 individuals active before the International Criminal Court.</p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.</p>  <p>  There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022.</p>  <p>  On 28 February, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine submitted a letter to the Presidency formally applying for membership of the European Union, in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty.  In light of the grave situation facing Ukraine, President Zelenskyy requested that the application be treated under &lsquo;a special procedure&rsquo;. Three days later Georgia and Moldova followed suit, submitting their letters of application on 03 March.</p>  <p>  Currently, EU relations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are set within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. &lsquo;Association Agreements&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements&rsquo; (DCFTAs) are in place with all three aimed at promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and ensuring respect for common values. While some progress has been made over the years towards closer integration with the EU, progress on reforms has been slow overall.</p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s application was discussed at the informal European Council meeting on 10 &amp;amp; 11 March. This resulted in the &lsquo;Versailles Declaration&rsquo;, which acknowledged the &ldquo;European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine&rdquo;. The European Council also invited the Commission to submit its opinion on all three applications in accordance with the established procedures, while noting that &ldquo;Ukraine belongs to our European family&rdquo;. The European Council meeting on 24-25 March again reaffirmed Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective and reiterated its invitation to the Commission to submit its opinion in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. It is not clear at this stage when the Commission will submit its formal Opinion on all three applications though the analysis required understandably takes time and in the past, it has taken up to three years for the Commission to revert to the Council with their opinion.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the European perspective of the Eastern Partnership&rsquo;s associated partners, Ukraine, Moldova &amp;amp; Georgia. Ukraine in particular has made impressive progress in aligning with EU standards and deserves recognition for their efforts to defend European values. We have come together with a grouping of other EU Member States who are similarly strongly supportive of Ukraine&rsquo;s application, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.  The EU should encourage and support Ukraine&rsquo;s application, though we should not minimise the steps that remain to be taken. There is no provision at present for any kind of &lsquo;associated membership&rsquo; for those countries submitting formal membership applications. </p>  <p>  In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement is Bulgaria&rsquo;s continued objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations. Discussions are continuing between the Bulgarian and North Macedonian governments to resolve the issues and both countries are to be commended for their efforts to promote closer cooperation and improved relations. </p>  <p>  The EU is continuing to encourage greater reform efforts on the part of Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in relation to Rule of Law and promotion of good governance. Serbia&rsquo;s non-alignment with the EU common position relating to Russia has also been of concern recently.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

I also raised immigration issues, including the situation of the undocumented Irish, in my meetings on Capitol Hill during my most recent visit to Washington, DC at the end of April. These engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum in the US, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p><p>Our Embassy in Washington D.C. and our network of Consulates across the US continue to raise immigration issues, seek new immigration pathways, and support US immigration reform through active engagement at all levels with the US Administration and political leaders. </p><p>An example of this is a bill passed by the Massachusetts State Senate this week which would enable undocumented immigrants to acquire a Massachusetts Driving License. Our Consulate in Boston has supported this practical initiative which will improve the lives of our undocumented citizens living in that region.  I met with Governor Charlie Baker in Boston last week and underlined the importance of immigration issues. </p><p>The Government remains committed to providing support and annual funding to the US Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers through our Emigrant Support Programme. These facilities, in turn, provide support to Irish citizens, including the undocumented Irish in the US. In 2020, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2021, over &euro;4.2 million was provided to diaspora organisations in the US for emigrant support and Covid-19 related projects.</p></reply>

Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, to bring about a political resolution to the conflict in Yemen.</p>  <p>  There have been numerous reports of acts in the course of the conflict which are contrary to international human rights law, including; damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure, gender based violence including sexual violence, torture, mistreatment of prisoners, violations against children including the recruitment of child soldiers, and violations against journalists, human rights defenders, minorities, migrants and internally displaced persons. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called on all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law including in our position as a UN Security Council member. At the UN Human Rights Council in 2017, Ireland was part of a core group of countries along with the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and Luxembourg that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution establishing a UN Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) to carry out investigations into alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. </p>  <p>  Ireland deeply regrets that a majority of countries on the Human Rights Council in Geneva voted against a further extension of the GEE mandate in October of last year and we remain committed to ensuring accountability in Yemen. An independent mechanism which can gather testimonies will be key in this context.</p></reply>

Responding to evolving circumstances over the course of 2021, Irish Aid humanitarian support to Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Mozambique and Venezuela increased over the course of the year. </p>  <p>  Ireland also responds to natural disasters, which last year included the assistance to the those affected by the volcanic eruption in St.Vincent and Grenadines, the earthquake in Haiti and Typhoon Rai in the Philippines.</p>  <p>  Our assistance is guided by regular humanitarian updates from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on evolving humanitarian needs.  These updates also help us track the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  This information helps ensure that Irish Aid reaches those most in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland is among the 64 donors which has signed up to a series of actions intended to make humanitarian assistance more effective and efficient, an initiative known as the Grand Bargain and which also includes key humanitarian actors such as UN agencies, the Red Cross Family and NGOs. In line with the Grand Bargain, donors are providing more flexible funding that allows partners to respond rapidly to needs as they arise. The Grand Bargain also promotes better data collection to more effectively target those most in need - particularly women, girls and people living with disabilities. </p></reply>

EU-UK engagement on resolving outstanding issues under the Protocol is an ongoing process. The EU-UK Joint Committee met on 21 February and the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on 8 March. </p><p>I am in regular and ongoing contact with stakeholders in Northern Ireland. We have consistently sought to listen and engage with the perspectives and concerns of everyone in relation to the Protocol, including those in the unionist community, as well as the business community and other stakeholders. Both I and the Taoiseach travelled to Northern Ireland in recent weeks to meet with political party representatives, community, civic, education, and business groups.</p><p>The clear message we have heard first hand from people and businesses in Northern Ireland is that they want the Protocol to work well. They see the very real opportunities, including for jobs, trade and investment, which are presented by the Protocol.  </p><p>I also maintain close contact with my counterparts in the UK and I have spoken in recent days to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis.</p><p>The European Commission also continues to engage closely with stakeholders in Northern Ireland. The EU has listened carefully to the genuine concerns expressed by citizens and business there with regard to the Protocol. Last October the Commission made proposals to address directly concerns raised.</p><p>Our message is clear. We continue to urge the British Government to engage constructively with the EU. Only joint solutions can provide long-term legal certainty and predictability to Northern Ireland. The flexibility shown by the EU now needs to be reciprocated by the UK Government.</p><p>It is important that we continue to work to support all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and the ongoing work of the peace process. In the period following the election, we will continue to engage with the parties in Northern Ireland in support of the functioning of all of the Good Friday Agreement institutions. </p><p>As always, the greatest stabilising dynamic is a visible partnership approach between the British and Irish Governments in support of the institutions, with the engagement and encouragement of our friends in the U.S. and the EU.</p></reply>

Through the J1, thousands of young people have the opportunity to work and travel in the US every year, building up valuable connections between the two countries. Ease of travel is essential to protect our strong transatlantic connections, be that in business, academia, tourism or maintaining family connections.</p>  <p>  The processing of US visas is solely a matter for the US authorities, and my Department has no remit over the operations of the US Embassy Visa Service. My advice to those seeking to apply for a US visa or for a visa waiver is to get information from the website of the US Embassy in Dublin and to engage with them directly on their application. </p>  <p>  In recent days, officials from my Department have discussed the matter with the US Embassy, who are working hard to minimise waiting times and have recently dedicated extra resources to the processing of J1 visa applications, which is expected to result in a significant increase in the number being processed in the coming days and weeks. </p></reply>

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds. </p>  <p>  An investment programme of &euro;210m has been delivered to schools under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 &ndash;2020.  Additionally, the first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy for schools to 2027, ICT grant funding of &euro;50m has recently issued to schools. Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. The grant funding allocation issues directly to schools and can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school.  In addition, my Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, to provide for a scheme for learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide, issued a once-off grant in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme. This funding also issued directly to schools as they are best placed to determine the needs of their own cohort. </p>  <p>  Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology Scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. </p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology Scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  Based on the professional information provided to the SENO and in line with criteria set out in Circular 10/2013, the SENO was not in a position to recommend an assistive technology grant for the school concerned on behalf of the student.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that an appeal for assistive technology for the pupil named by the deputy was received in my Department and a decision has issued to the school concerned on the 4th of May 2022.</p></reply>

Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools. </p><p>My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas (SPA's) including the school planning area of Newcastle/Rathcoole.</p><p>Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p><p>Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p><p>The projected peak enrolment year for the Newcastle/Rathcoole SPA is 2025 with 1,544 post primary school places required.  The combined current 2021 enrolment in the two post primary schools in the SPA is 1,200 pupils.  Major building projects are in train in both schools, which when completed, will provide capacity for 2,000 pupils. </p><p>The building project for Holy Family Community School, Rathcoole is currently at tender stage with a target date of Quarter 4 of 2022 to commence on site.</p><p>The building project for Col&aacute;iste Pobail Fola, Saggart is currently at Stage 2b (detailed design) of the architectural planning process.

As part of the rollout of the Framework for Junior Cycle, Geography was one of five new subject specifications that were introduced to schools in September 2018.</p><p>The Junior Cycle has been developed over several years with the final phase of new subject specifications introduced to schools in September 2019. The Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health. </p><p>The Framework for Junior Cycle focuses on active and collaborative learning. It gives greater flexibility and autonomy to schools in terms of subject selection, and short courses, to tailor a student&rsquo;s learning to achieve better outcomes for that student. Students are able to study up to 10 subjects for certification through the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.</p><p>We have a dedicated cohort of Geography teachers in our post-primary schools, who are promoting the inclusion of their subject within programmes provided to students by their schools. Through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 the curricular significance of Geography has been retained and given a new impetus across the Junior Cycle curriculum.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, as part of the reforms I announced on 29 March two new subjects &lsquo;Drama, Film and Theatre Studies&rsquo; and &lsquo;Climate Action and Sustainable Development&rsquo;, will be introduced for Leaving Certificate students, starting in September 2024 in network schools. </p><p>Both subjects were raised as suggested subjects at different stages of the review of Senior Cycle carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). I have requested the NCCA to develop these new subject areas as a matter of priority. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that my Department, together with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, are currently finalising the 2<sup>nd</sup>National Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development &ndash; ESD to 2030.  A joint public consultation has been conducted and the results have informed the direction of ESD to 2030 which will also have an accompanying implementation plan for 2022 to 2026.</p><p>Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) has three strands:  Environmental, Political and Social and is both a target in itself under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4.7), and also acknowledged as a key enabler for achievement of all 17 SDGs. </p><p>Under the first ESD strategy 2014 &ndash; 2020, significant work was done integrating ESD themes and principles into the curriculum at all levels, into the assessment and inspection processes and into Initial teacher education and continuing professional development.  ESD to 2030 will build on this work ensuring that the 2030 target is met. This work also contributes to SDG 13 - Climate Action, and to Ireland's Climate Action Plan.</p><p>ESD to 2030 will be built on the UNESCO framework for ESD for 2030 and will be built on the five key priority areas set out therein, i.e. policy alignment, transforming learning environments, capacity building, empowering and mobilising youth and community engagement.  </p><p>It will aim to extend ESD beyond the classroom into non-formal and informal education settings, it will aim to empower learners to take action individually and in their communities for sustainable development, it will map ESD related CPD, programmes and resources to identify and address any gaps in order to further support the teaching and learning of ESD, it will work with a wider range of Departments, organisations and NGOs to ensure policy alignment and to develop tools to capture, monitor and report on progress.  ESD to 2030 will also seek to increase opportunities for learners to develop skills by taking action e.g. through project work at individual and community level.</p><p>It is expected that ESD to 2030 and its accompanying implementation plan 2022 - 2025 will be published in Q2 2022</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.1094.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000080#WRU03500"><p>Earlier this month, the Government announced this year's Summer Programme to allow all primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million. The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for those who are at key transition stages, helping to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further/higher education or training. </p>  <p>  In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the government announced a expansion to the summer programme.  Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total provisional spend across the school and home-based elements for 2021 was &euro;36m.</p>  <p>  While, it is critically important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure that the children with complex special educational needs (SEN) who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  At the time when the &lsquo;July Provision&rsquo; was established, the concert of learning loss during school holidays was something which may have been considered to impact only those students in special schools and special classes. As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with education stakeholders and advocacy groups, following this, steps were taken to encourage more schools to participate including the following: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme.</p>  <p>  The complexities of organising a summer programme in special school environments is recognised and further enhanced funding for special schools is being provided this year including increase capitation and preparation to support these schools.</p>  <p>  Concerns around availability of staff have been further addressed with the provision to recruit final year student teachers and student teachers registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5. To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, principals may delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. Overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the school year in addition to their normal salary.</p>  <p>  In 2021 377 special schools and schools with special classes ran a programme, with in the region of 5,587 pupils attending. For context in 2011 there were 149 schools and 2,461 pupils attending the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; programme. The number of special schools running a programme under the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; scheme had fallen from 54 in 2011 to 34 in 2019. It is important to note that we have actually seen an increase in the number of special schools running a programme in both 2020 and 2021 with 39 special schools taking part in 2021.</p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.</p>  <p>  Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher/SNA where possible.</p></reply>

Last week the Government announced an expanded summer programme to allow primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  An information pack has issued to all schools now, and an online registration portal for schools opened on 04 May 2022.</p><p>The total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million.</p><p>The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups.</p><p>The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for those who are at key transition stages, helping to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further/higher education or training. </p><p>The programmes on offer this summer include: </p><p>- Inclusion Programme (Primary) for all primary schools (2-3 weeks programmes) for mainstream pupils with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>- Special Classes and Special School Programme in primary (2-5 weeks programmes)</p><p>- DEIS Numeracy and literacy Camps/Campa&iacute; Samhraidh in DEIS primary schools (one week per camp)</p><p>- Inclusion Programme (Post-Primary) for all post-primary schools (2 weeks) for students with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage</p><p>- Home based provision for students with complex needs where no school-based programme is available (4 weeks &ndash; 40 hours)</p><p>A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the Summer Programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p><p>To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p><p>Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools.</p><p>These include</p><p>- A Centralised Application Process to reduce admin burden on schools.</p><p>- Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.</p><p>- Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.</p><p>- Guidance, Information and support will be provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.</p><p>- Capitation Grant Funding will be provided to cover the running costs of the scheme including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p><p>This year for the first time there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.  The Department is also working on improving the payment timelines for the home-based programme and further information will be issued on this in due course.</p><p>Through the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education (NABMSE) the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for special schools and provided a presentation on supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme including the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p></reply>

The programme was only offered in special schools and schools with special classes. Where an eligible child&rsquo;s school was not offering a programme funding was provided for parents to engage a teacher to provide tuition in the child&rsquo;s home.</p><p>In 2020 a significantly expanded summer programme was established as a response to COVID-19 with the eligibility criteria widened to include approximately 9,000 additional children with complex needs.  </p><p>The programme aims were to ensure, in so far as possible, that these children could reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  As part of this expansion, the Department&rsquo;s existing Literacy and Numeracy camps for DEIS Primary Band 1 schools was included in the Summer Programme and extended to all DEIS Primary schools. Furthermore, DEIS post-primary schools were given the option of running an inclusion programme for the first time.</p><p>In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the government announced a further expansion to the Summer Programme.  Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. For the first time, all primary schools were given the opportunity to run a 2-3 week inclusion programme, and the inclusion programme that ran in DEIS post-primary schools in 2020 was expanded to include all post-primary schools.</p><p>The information below relates to the Special Class and Special School programme and the Home-Based Summer Programme over the years 2016-2021: <table>    <tr>       <th>Special Class and Special School Programme</th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Schools with Special Classes.  </td>       <td>177</td>       <td>200</td>       <td>201 </td>       <td>220 </td>       <td>338</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Special Schools  </td>       <td>42 </td>       <td>41 </td>       <td>31 </td>       <td>35 </td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Children with Autism </td>       <td>2,939 </td>       <td>3,063 </td>       <td>2,922 </td>       <td>* </td>       <td>*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Children with Severe &amp;amp; Profound GLD </td>       <td>483 </td>       <td>493 </td>       <td>483 </td>       <td>* </td>       <td>* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of Children who participated in   Special Class and Special School Programme</td>       <td>3,422 </td>       <td>3,556 </td>       <td>3,405 </td>       <td>3,892 </td>       <td>5,587</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Home Based Programme </td>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Children with Autism </td>       <td>5,717 </td>       <td>6,563 </td>       <td>7,068 </td>       <td>* </td>       <td>* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Severe &amp;amp; Profound </td>       <td>205 </td>       <td>109 </td>       <td>90 </td>       <td>* </td>       <td>* </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total no. of children participating in Home Based   July Provision</td>       <td>5,922 </td>       <td>6,672 </td>       <td>7,158 </td>       <td>9,716 </td>       <td>13,321</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total no. of children<br /><br />(Home Based &amp;amp; Special Class and Special School Programme </td>       <td>9,344 </td>       <td>10,228 </td>       <td>10,563 </td>       <td>13,608 </td>       <td>18,908</td>    </tr> </table> *As the scheme was expanded in 2020 to become the Summer Programme, which had broader eligibility criteria, the number of children participating with ASD or a severe/profound general learning difficulty for 2020 and 2021 are included in the overall total of eligible children.  </p><p>Information on the percentages of pupils who had or did not have disabilities is not available.</p></reply>

I set out a clear vision for Senior Cycle, building upon the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA&rsquo;s) Advisory Report. The NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including teachers.</p>  <p>  The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to:</p>  <p>  - Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century</p>  <p>  - Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system</p>  <p>  - Embed wellbeing and reduce student stress levels</p>  <p>  The reforms I announced include initiatives to spread the assessment load for students and do so in a way that enhances student wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Bearing in mind the significant assessment load at the end of sixth year, as an interim measure I have asked the SEC to immediately alter the timing of Paper One in both Irish and English so that Paper One would take place at the end of fifth year commencing for fifth years entering fifth year in September 2023.</p>  <p>  In making this announcement, I have responded to a broad consensus for spreading the assessment load. In this regard, the NCCA Advisory Report emphasised the need to reduce the focus on the final examination period and the stress experienced by students associated with this time.</p>  <p>  Since September last, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has held a number of hearings on Senior Cycle reform. Throughout these hearings, a desire to spread assessment over a greater period has been a recurring theme on which there has been broad consensus.</p>  <p>  I have also listened to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which made a number of concluding observations in its 2016 periodic report on Ireland.  The Committee expressed its concern about the pressure that the Leaving Certificate examination places on children and recommended that Ireland consider reforming the Leaving Certificate to reduce the stress caused to children.</p>  <p>  Importantly, I have also listened to students themselves who have called for the spread of assessment and striking a balance between final exams and other forms of assessment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the SEC is a statutory body established in 2003 under the Education Act, 1998. The SEC&rsquo;s role is to provide a high-quality candidate-centred state examinations and assessment system incorporating the highest standards of openness, fairness and accountability. The written examinations provided by the SEC are marked by examiners, (generally experienced teachers in the subject), who work under the overall direction and management of the Chief Examiner for the subject.  There is a particular focus on quality assurance throughout all of the SEC&rsquo;s procedures including the marking of the examinations.   The management of the State examinations, including the marking of examinations and the timing of the marking, are matters for the SEC. </p>  <p>  As I have said, altering the timing of Paper One in Irish and English is an interim measure designed to spread the assessment load and thereby reduce the stress experienced by students, pending the full development of a variety of examination components in all subjects. It should also be noted that the weighting and importance of Paper One in each of the subjects has not been changed or reduced.</p>  <p>  A Senior Cycle Programme Delivery Board will be established which will have responsibility for overseeing the redevelopment of Senior Cycle and the implementation work involved will include consultation with education partners, including teachers, students, school leaders and parents.</p></reply>

My Department ran an expanded summer education programme for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage for Summer 2021, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p><p>The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p><p>For the first time ever, all schools (<i>primary and-post primary</i>) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools. This resulted in 945 schools participating in the overall programme, a rise of 72% over 2020. 24,656 pupils participated in the 2021 school-based programme, an increase of 85% over 2020.</p><p>A home-based summer programme continued to be available for children with complex needs where their schools are not providing a school based programme. A total of 13,321 students availed of the home-based programme, an increase of 35% on 2020.</p><p>Overall, 37,977 pupils participated in the 2021 summer programme across both home and school-based elements, which represented an increase of 65% on participation in the 2020 programme.</p><p>A provisional amount of &euro;36 million was spent on the summer programme, out of the total of &euro;40 million allocated.</p></reply>

The role of the SNAs is set out in various Department circulars.  The allocation of SNAs is the responsibility of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  There are well established allocation SNA: student ratios for students with particular disabilities enrolled in both special classes and special schools. There are separate arrangements for students with special educational needs (SEN) enrolled in mainstream classes. Many students with SEN enrolled in mainstream classes do not have significant care needs and are supported through the Special Education Teacher (SET) allocation in line with their need. </p>  <p>  Working is ongoing in terms of the SNA allocation for the school year 2022/2023 and consultation with the education partners will form a key component and details will be announced in the near future. </p>  <p>  A key consideration in the allocation of SNAs is to ensure that those students with the greatest level of care needs receive the most support. This is a key principle underlying Department policy on special education. The allocation system must be objective and fair with the capacity to take account of local and individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Up to 2019/20, allocations were made by the NCSE on the basis of a diagnosis as evidenced by a report provided by a professional confirming the care needs of an individual student.</p>  <p>  A core recommendation of the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s (NCSE) Review of the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme (2018) concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools and called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of a profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of special education teachers (SETs). </p></reply>

The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people. Irish is also an official language of the European Union.  It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.</p>  <p>  In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and secondary level schools and centres for education in Ireland.  This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of Irish in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  All students in Primary and Second Level schools are required to study Irish unless they have been granted a Certificate of Exemption from the study of Irish.  </p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of the Department has been to use circulars as a means for communicating a number of matters including schemes, rules and other conditions associated with the recognition and funding of schools, and setting the terms and conditions of school staff.  Much of that practice evolved in the absence of primary legislation governing the education sector.  Following a national convention in the mid-1990s, a programme of educational reform was initiated. For the first time, this included the enactment of landmark pieces of primary legislation governing the school system. This included the Education Act 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  While such legislation does permit of the making of regulations in a number of areas, regulations are not required in all situations.  The practice of using administrative circulars which is familiar to schools, teachers and other school staff, and which allows for a necessary degree of flexibility and responsiveness has continued. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language.  Section 6 of the Act provides that every person concerned with the implementation of the Act shall have regard to objects specified therein. These objects include contributing to the realisation of national policy and objectives in relation to the extension of bilingualism in Irish society and in particular the achievement of a greater use of the Irish language at school and in the community (Section 6(i)) and contributing to the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in Gaeltacht areas (Section 6(j)).  The responsibilities of the Department  in respect of the teaching and promotion of Irish are also apparent from Sections 7(2)(d); 9(f) and (h); 13(3)(f); 31, 41(2)(g); 62(7)(h) and 62(9) thereof.</p>  <p>  Rule 70(3) of the Rules for National Schools (1965) lists Irish as an obligatory subject for pupils in National Schools and Curricula for Irish are prescribed by the minister in accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act 1998. Rule 21(1) of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools 2004/2005 provides that the approved course for a post-primary school student must include not less than five of the subjects of which one must be Irish.  Students are not required to sit an Irish examination nor is it a requirement to pass an Irish Examination in order to complete the Junior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate.  In that context, the most recent curricular changes at primary and junior cycle level have emphasised not only the importance of learning both languages but also the wider benefits of bilingualism.  The development of these new language curricula reflects my department&rsquo;s reassertion of its commitment to the Irish language and to progressing the language education related actions of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.</p></reply>

This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.</p>  <p>  In saying this, the Department of Education is aware that a number of contractors have highlighted concerns about the ability to sustain school transport services to the end of the current school year given the recent increases in the cost of fuel. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services and is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p><p>To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p><p>Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools, these include:-</p><p>- A Centralised Application Process to reduce admin burden on schools.</p><p>- Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.</p><p>- Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.</p><p>- Guidance, Information and support will be provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.</p><p>- Earlier payment of school staff will be facilitated</p><p>- Capitation Grant Funding will be provided to cover the running costs of the scheme including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p><p>However, the Department also recognises that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.</p><p>Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher/SNA where possible.</p><p>The NCSE have compiled a non-exhaustive list of private home tutor services and online platforms who may advertise for tutors for the 2022 Summer Programme and published it on their website.</p><p>Additionally the Irish Primary Principals Network has created a Summer Programme Noticeboard for teachers and SNAs to advertise their availability for the programme.  Parents can also post notices on the board to source suitable candidates.  </p><p>My Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments. It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. For those aged 66 or over,these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment from my Department.

This means that people from Ukraine arriving in the State will receive a letter confirming that they have been granted temporary protection under this Directive.</p>  <p>  The priority of my Department is to assist Ukrainian people to apply for an income support payment immediately on their arrival in the State. A fast-track approach to processing such applications has been put in place which includes simplified decision-making and swift processing of Personal Public Service Numbers to facilitate prompt access to a range of public services.</p>  <p>  A reception centre has been set up in Dublin Airport where officials from my Department and other Government Departments are available to meet Ukrainian people and to help them access a range of services including income supports. My Department has also established dedicated Ukraine Support Centres in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the services, including the employment support services, of the Intreo Centres located across the country are also available to Ukrainian people.Ukrainian citizens in Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive can work legally in the State and are entitled to the range of statutory employment rights and protections in the same manner as Irish workers.</p>  <p>  A dedicated webpage has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website to ensure people arriving from Ukraine are aware of the supports and services available to them. The webpage is entitled &lsquo;Social Welfare supports for those arriving from Ukraine under the EU Temporary Protection Directive&rsquo;. The information on the webpage is in plain English and also in the Ukrainian and Russian languages. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Social insurance schemes are paid to those covered by the Social Insurance Fund, whereas social assistance payments are designed to support those most in need and are based on a means-test.  However, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the Irish social welfare system.</p>  <p>  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, even if the person experiences more than one contingency at the same time, generally, they can receive only one of those payments to help meet the person&rsquo;s income needs.  This means that a person will not be able to claim Widow&rsquo;s Pension, Widower's Pension or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension and Illness Benefit at the same time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that people might be eligible to claim one of the supports below in addition to their Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension:</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly means-tested tax-free payment available to employees with children.  A person can receive Working Family Payment (if they meet the criteria) and get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension at the same time. Full details are available and updated regularly on the www.gov.ie website.  The Widow's, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  A person might also be eligible to receive Living Alone Increase, Fuel Allowance or Household Benefits Package depending on their living circumstances and their age.</p>  <p>  Supplementary Welfare Allowance is available to people struggling financially.  This is a means-tested payment.  It is administered by this Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service and can be accessed by customers through their local Intreo office.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.</p>  <p>  Full details of the above and further rules and guidelines are available and updated regularly on the www.gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to keep the range of supports under review.  However, changing the underlying one person, one payment principle would involve significant additional expenditure which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and which would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This information is available in Ukrainian and Russian.</p>  <p>  Employers across all sectors who wish to support people arriving from Ukraine through provision of employment opportunities are advised to register on www.jobsireland.ie to advertise vacancies. This will enable Intreo Employment Services Officers to match the skills of those seeking employment with available work opportunities. People arriving from Ukraine seeking employment can also use jobsireland to upload details of their skills and experience for matching with available employment opportunities. Ukrainians are invited to attend Intreo Jobs Fairs and other employment events arranged countrywide.</p>  <p>  Since the middle of April, Intreo Employment Services are arranging employment support events specifically for Ukrainians. These are being arranged on an outreach basis in, or close to, current accommodation hubs and by inviting Ukrainians to Intreo Centres to receive these services.</p>  <p>  At these events, details of Ukrainians proficiency in English, their qualifications, employment history and employment preference are provided to assist with job matching. Those attending are also assisted on site to find employment through the provision of information on employment opportunities &ndash; via jobsireland.ie and with &lsquo;jobs walls&rsquo; advertising local vacancies. Assistance is also provided to ensure that Ukrainians are on the correct income support payment, be it jobseeker's allowance or another payment more appropriate to their personal circumstances.</p>  <p>  To date Intreo Employment Services staff have engaged with almost 4,000 Ukrainians at these events. Of those, many have high levels of education and professional qualifications, and they have a broad range of work experience. Around 60% have indicated that English language skills may be a barrier to finding employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with education and training boards to facilitate access to relevant training supports, including English language training.</p>  <p>  Therefore at this stage, widespread employment supports are being provided to Ukrainians through a number of channels, including dedicated supports for Ukrainians. My Department through Intreo will continue this work, to assist Ukrainians find employment while they remain in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department's employment services are available to those in the International Protection system. Intreo Employment Services staff engage systematically with refugees who are in receipt of a jobseeker payment and the walk-in service is available to all on a volunteer basis. </p>  <p>  Local teams have also been engaging with Cultural Ambassadors, linked with Local Community Development Committees, to explore how to best leverage their services to support migrants, refugees and asylum seekers into employment. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The household composition rules for Fuel Allowance indicate that an applicant must live alone or only with a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren).

The report notes also that even where individuals had the same disability, different needs could be identified. Indecon concluded that costs faced by individuals will severe disabilities on average ranged from &euro;9,600-&euro;12,300 per annum and for those with limited disabilities from &euro;8,700-&euro;10,000 per annum.  The report further concludes that:  </p><p>- Measures to address the additional costs of disability should be based on a multifaceted approach involving increased cash payments, enhanced access to service provision and specific targeted grant programmes;</p><p>- A high priority should be given to facilitating an increase in employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities;</p><p>- Concentration of any additional supports should be targeted on those most in need and who face the greatest additional costs of disability.  This would be more effective in meeting policy objectives and in enhancing value for money than introducing additional small scale supports for those who face minor additional costs of disability.</p><p>- That the levels of disability payments and allowances should be changed to reflect the very different costs of disability by severity and type of disability.</p><p>In Budget 2022 a number of measures were introduced to support people with disabilities and carers. </p><p>- An increase across core social welfare payments/rates. (Increases to the weekly rates of payment for working age recipients under 66 years of age) by &euro;5 per week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates).</p><p>- Increase to the income disregard for Carer's Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.</p><p>- Increase to the Capital Disregard for Carer's Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.</p><p>- Extension to the period during which Domiciliary Care Allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months (including payment of Carer's Allowance for this period).</p><p>- Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance, by &euro;25 per week, from  &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week.</p><p>- Increase in the rate of the Wage Subsidy Scheme for private sector employers by &euro;1 per hour (equivalent to 60% of National Minimum Wage)</p><p>Three grants, currently available through Intreo centres, to also be available through EmployAbility contractors in 2022; these are: </p><p>- Job Interview Interpreter Grant </p><p>- Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant </p><p>- Personal Reader Grant</p><p>Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60 (was &euro;2.50 per week).</p><p>- Extension to the eligibility for the disregard of PhD scholarship income, in the means test, to recipients of the Blind Pension.</p><p>- Introduction of a grant of up to &euro;500 in any calendar year towards the purchase of wigs/hairpieces/hair replacement system in cases of hair loss due to illness or treatment of an illness.</p><p>- Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week - with immediate effect.  This increase was paid from early November 2021.  The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120. </p><p>Increase to the Living Alone Allowance (LAA) of &euro;3, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week.  The LAA is an additional payment made each week to:</p><p>- people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, including State pensions, and who are living alone;</p><p>- people who are less than 66 years of age, living alone and in receipt of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension.</p><p>Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion (2020-2025) and Pathways to Work (2021-2025) strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to simplify the system and take account of the concerns expressed in the Make Work Pay report&rsquo;, and a review the current long-term disability payment schemes with a view to removing inconsistencies/anomalies and ensuring that they recognise the continuum of disabilities and support employment&rsquo;.</p><p>This work is currently underway within my Department, with a public consultation process to commence in due course.</p><p>The estimated additional cost to the Exchequer of a weekly cost of disability payment of &euro;20, &euro;30 and &euro;40 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="4">Estimated additional cost to the Exchequer of a weekly cost of disability payment of &euro;20, &euro;30 and &euro;40</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960 </td>       <td>&euro;20 </td>       <td>x 52 </td>       <td>&euro;276m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960</td>       <td>&euro;30 </td>       <td>x 52 </td>       <td>&euro;413m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>264,960</td>       <td>&euro;40 </td>       <td>x 52 </td>       <td>&euro;551m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* note: the estimate is based only on persons in receipt of the following payments (at the end of 2021): Domiciliary Care Allowance, Partial Capacity Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Disablement Benefit.

A revised decision letter dated 28/03/2022 issued to the person concerned advising her of the decision and of the overpayment that had been incurred.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.1322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000083#WRX05900"><p>My Department provides a range of income supports for full-time carers including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  While the caring requirements of carees may be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.    </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that payments made by my Department are set out in legislation.  There is no provision to provide flexibility in relation to means testing thresholds for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as outlined by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  From June the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the carer means test which will take effect in June:  </p>  <p>  -  An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner,</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  My Department already provides a non means-tested payment specifically for carers of incapacitated children in the form of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  This is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  The payment is not based on the type of disability but on the resulting physical or mental impairment which means that the child requires substantially more care and attention than another child of the same age. Since 1 June 2017, all children getting DCA are eligible for a medical card without a means test.</p>  <p>  In addition, the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all family carers providing full time care and assistance regardless of means. As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Grant from its then current rate of &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850, effective from June 2021.  The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is &euro;262.4 million.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or additional payment supports - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Since their contributions fall short of the requisite 520 paid full-rate contributions, they do not qualify for State pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  If the person concerned considers they have contributions from employment that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence of the missing periods of employment to my Department along with a State Pension (contributory) application form and their pension entitlement will be examined.

This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.</p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.</p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out. </p>  <p>  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same. Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE services in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to staffing requirements implied by statutory ratios.</p>  <p>  City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees public funding for the employment of graduates in ELC more fairly distributed across the system.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than services opening fewer hours or offering fewer places. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme. </p>  <p>  Core Funding is calculated based on the hours that the service is open and available to children. However, non-contact time is factored into the base rate in two ways. Firstly, data from Sector Profile on current amount of contact and non-contact time for different grades of staff was used to build in an allowance for non-contact time into the allocation for staff costs. Secondly, there is a separate allocation for administrative staff/time.</p>  <p>  Approximately two thirds of the funding for Core Funding is intended to contribute to improved pay rates across different categories of staff. This portion of the budget cannot be made available without assurances that this funding will be channelled towards achieving the intended policy objective of improved pay and conditions. Core Funding is therefore largely contingent on the details of an ERO being agreed.</p>  <p>  However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. If an ERO is agreed, where services are already paying above the ERO rate there will not be a requirement to increase rates of pay. Improved terms and conditions, opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, I also launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. </p>  <p>  Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of part-funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for Early Years Educators working in the sector. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will shortly appoint a consultant to undertake a 12 month review of ECCE which will consider any enhancements that can be made based on international evidence and experience to date. The review will involve a wide consultation with providers, educators, parents, children and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed, such as the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, detailed information relating to Core Funding is now available at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding.    </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p>  <p>  2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500;</p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2021, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2022.</p>  <p>  Particular priority is afforded to those on the lowest incomes and social welfare dependents through the special rate of grant, which is payable at the higher non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance travelled to the college attended. </p>  <p>  As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the student grant scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  However, the Student Grant Scheme also makes provision for combining periods of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting the 391 days eligibility requirement for the special rate of grant. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances includes no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Since September 2021, students have not been eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment , in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  On Wednesday 11 May 2022 at 1pm, the Student Grant Scheme Office will provide a virtual briefing for all Oireachtas members. </p></reply>

Agreement was also reached in November 2019, in respect of access to leave schemes, paid leave and access to the appropriate public sector pension scheme. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the issue relating to aligning adult education tutors to a pay scale of an existing grade within the ETB sector remains unresolved.  As this element was viewed as cost-increasing it was therefore prohibited by the Public Service Stability Agreement and precluded under section 5 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2010. Accordingly, the claim was not conceded.  </p>  <p>  The claim was referred to the Labour Court by SIPTU and TUI. Following a Labour Court hearing on the 6th March 2020 a recommendation was made with the key points being that the Court noted the constraints of the FEMPI legislation and collective agreements and that the official side should identify the scale of cost it is prepared or able to absorb to address the claim and formulate an offer. The matter is being examined by my Department in consultation with the Departments of Education and Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to finalising the official position at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

The impact of the rising costs for students was highlighted  in the recently launched independent report, the Review of the Student Grant scheme commissioned by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides grant assistance to eligible students attending an approved full-time course in an approved further or higher educational institution who meet the prescribed eligibility criteria of the relevant scheme.  </p>  <p>  Significant additional Funding has been made available to support students under recent budgets and through the Return to Education Packages for 2020 and 2021. The principal support provided by my Department in financial terms is the Student Grant Scheme, which assists more than 70,000 students annually to access third level education. The budgetary provision for the Student Grant Scheme in 2021 is &euro;364.5m. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall funding secured for the third level sector to safely reopen in September 2021, an additional &euro;10m is available for the 2021/2022 academic year, providing a doubling of the core Student Assistance Fund bringing the total funding to &euro;17.2m. The Covid Contingency Fund for Access Services of &euro;1.9m has also being continued for a further year. </p>  <p>  The special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students is a higher rate of grant which targets "those most in need", which is defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the conditions are fulfilled.  For the 2022/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022.</p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022/23 this will mean:</p>  <p>  -  An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. </p>  <p>  -  The income thresholds to qualify for the standard rates of student grant have been increased by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  -  The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme. </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants are reviewed annually by the Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including student grants, are considered in the context of the annual Budget.   I intend to implement, in a phased way, the recommendations of the Student Grant Scheme review in the context of successive annual Estimates processes. However this will be dependent on the availability of resources to his Department and overall consideration of Budgetary and Ministerial priorities. </p>  <p>  This summer in advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p>  <p>  Students experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p></reply>

Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one<b></b>of the pathways to study medicine. Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme review comments on the issue of Graduate Entry Medicine and states that a wider issues remains as to whether greater flexibility in the criteria for student grant scheme could be considered in areas of critical skills shortage reflecting graduate entry routes. </p><p>There are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations, as well as wider implications, if the current treatment of graduate entry medicine was amended. However, we now have this review and all elements will be subject to consideration by my Department, including prioritisation and consideration of the cost of education measures through the annual estimates process. This will include any additional supports for Students of graduate entry medicine. </p><p>The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (NAP) identifies target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education who would not have considered attending higher education without such supports.The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanise established to implement the National Access Plan (NAP).There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;42m between the periods 2017 to 2022.Strand 2 provides bursaries to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. With effect from the 2021/22 academic year, a three-tier system of bursary provision has been introduced. This consists of the existing 203 bursaries arising from the original call worth &euro;5,000 per annum (Tier 1), 120 bursaries worth &euro;2,000 per annum (Tier 2) and a number of once-off bursaries worth &euro;1,500 payable for the 2021/22 academic year only (Tier 3).</p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

Funding the Future, which was approved for publication by Government, settles the question on funding Higher Education. The Government has decided that income contingent loans for fees will not form part of the future funding model. Instead, the Government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.</p>  <p>  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform. This includes planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.</p>  <p>  Given the strong need for alignment of skills outputs with needs of employers, it is proposed that the National Training Fund will continue to form part of the funding model.  Investment to date through the National Training Fund has made a significant contribution, supporting apprenticeship provision, funding innovative approaches through the Human Capital Initiative and delivering enterprise focused programmes which are responsive to skills needs.  This continued investment is strategically important to the continued agility and responsiveness of higher education to national socio and economic priorities.  </p>  <p>  The allocation for each scheme under the NTF is generally determined as part of the annual Estimates process with the NTF being included as an annex to the published Estimates of my Department. As the Deputy will appreciate the exact source of funding, either Exchequer or NTF, is subject to future budget considerations and it is not possible at this time to speculate on any changes to the NTF contributions.</p></reply>

The programme was developed to tackle issues of sexual and relationship violence, by educating and empowering students to support the development of a visible institutional pro-social culture which stands against unacceptable behaviour and abuse and fostering a culture of positivity and support. The programme highlights the danger of normalising abusive behaviour, and cultivates an understanding of someone's capacity to intervene. The programme provides students with a safe environment to better understand appropriate social interactions and to identify unacceptable behaviour, ensuring an understanding of the importance and meaning of consent, but also more broadly, personal assertiveness and social responsibility.</p>  <p>  Since the expansion of its remit in August 2020, the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion has worked with the Programme to ensure the national roll-out of this training. National reporting on the Framework for Consent in Irish HEIs in November 2021 showed that a majority of HEIs had engaged with the programme and were offering or intended to offer this training. This year the HEA will support a project that will make the online programme available to all publicly funded higher education institutions on a pilot basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, funding of &euro;11,996 was awarded by the Irish Research Council under Strand 1a for the intervention at second level - educating and empowering our young people to speak up and demand a zero tolerance approach to all forms of sexual harassment and violence. </p>  <p>  I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

The Government has decided that income contingent loans for fees will not form part of the future funding model. Instead, the Government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund and student contribution.  It is also my intention that in response to the cost of education and living, a reduced reliance on student contributions will be a feature of future reforms. </p><p>Funding the Future was created as part of a Department of Further and Higher Education, Research and Innovation response to the commissioned independent report Increasing the Sustainability of Higher and Further Education in Ireland and the separate independent review of the Student Grant Scheme, conducted in response to a Programme for Government commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports.</p><p>The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform. </p><p>The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education (2016) identified three funding options for a more sustainable future funding model and highlighted the implications (both costs and benefits) for (i) the State, (ii) students; (iii) employers, and (iv) Higher Education institutions. These options were:<ol type="1"><li>A predominantly state-funded system</li><li>Increased state funding with continuing student fees </li><li>Increased state-funding with deferred payment of fees through income contingent loans.</li></ol>As the Deputy will appreciate Higher education studies entail substantial investment and decisions must be made in the context of overall government expenditure. The 3 options considered in the economic assessment envisaged significant costs for the state and presented significant challenges in terms of future sustainability in relation to competing demands for public money.</p><p>In this regard and in consideration of a range of suitable options to recognise the financial pressures being experienced by students the consultants examined a hybrid option in consultation with my department and the EU Commission's DG reform Unit to model how a hybrid model derived from option 2 that incorporated more modest increases in maintenance support and an income contingent maintenance fund to support a more informed consideration of future funding options.</p><p>The supplementary &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; option, as presented in the published report &ldquo;Increasing the Sustainability of Higher and Further Education in Ireland&rdquo;, presents the same sectoral funding need as option 2, which has been confirmed by Government as the preferred option, with a mix of exchequer and NTF funding with continued student contributions. </p><p>In terms of student supports it considered smaller economic increase in maintenance rates, when compared to the other options and the addition of an income contingent maintenance loan to support students with the cost of education.  As the deputy is aware Government did not approve income contingent loans as a suitable and sustainable option for higher education in Ireland.  </p><p>The Funding the Future policy is available at the following location: www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/49e56-future-funding-in-higher-education/.</p></reply>

The Regulations also transpose the comprehensive data protection and data security requirements of the Directive.</p>  <p>  There is an optional measure provided for in the Directive for the extension of the passenger name record arrangements to flights arriving from other EU states. The purpose of the Criminal Justice (Passenger Name Record) Bill is to enable the State to avail of this option and extend the operation of the passenger name record regime to flights arriving from other EU states. Under Action 28 of Justice Plan 2022, which I recently published, it is intended to progress policy preparations by Q4 of 2022 on legislation for the collection of intra-EU Passenger Name Record data.

At this time, I have no plans to issue an extension beyond 31 May 2022.</p>  <p>  Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at: inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login. Since its introduction in July 2020, the online renewal process has completed approximately 125,000 applications. </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers.</p>  <p>  The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission for the first time are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. To date, the service has provided 17,405 appointments, with a further 10,459 appointments booked to early July 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department's Registration Office customer service team is also available to support customers who may have language difficulties or who may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on my Department's website www.irishimmigration.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department's Registration Office in Burgh Quay is responsible for registering immigration permissions for customers residing in the Dublin area only. First time registrations and renewals for customers outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network. The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in these matters.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the prevention and investigation of cybercrime is a priority for the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Since 2016 the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%. These funds provide for continued investment in the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB), with ongoing expansion of the Bureau.</p><p>The Bureau is the national Garda unit tasked with the forensic examination of computer media seized during the course of any criminal investigations. These include murders, cybercrime, online harassment, computer intrusions, child exploitation offences and any criminal investigation in which computers are seized or may contain evidential data. The unit also conducts investigations into cyber-dependent crimes which are significant or complex in nature, network intrusions, data interference and attacks on websites belonging to Government departments, institutions and corporate entities.</p><p>The Bureau is part of Organised and Serious Crime, and is staffed by civilian personnel and Garda members of various ranks up to Detective Superintendent. Members of the unit undergo intensive training in the area of forensic computing and cybercrime investigations, and give expert witness testimony in all types of investigations and prosecutions in court. In addition to its forensic and investigative role, GNCCB acts as a liaison with various partner agencies and law enforcement bodies.</p><p>The expansion of the GNCCB is a priority project under <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>, the implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The aim of this project is to significantly enhance the capabilities of GNCCB to tackle cybercrime in this jurisdiction, including the establishment of six GNCCB Cyber Satellite hubs strategically located throughout the country.</p><p>I am pleased to note that Cyber Satellite hubs have recently been established in Cork, Galway, Mullingar and Wexford. These hubs are engaged in cybercrime forensics, investigations and support roles.</p><p>For the Deputy's information the table below, which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out  the number of cases that the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau has dealt with in 2020, 2021, and up to and including 9 May 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Cases created on GNCCB systems</th>       <th>Cases closed by GNCCB</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>400</td>       <td>333</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>490</td>       <td>431</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To-date in 2022</td>       <td>166</td>       <td>162</td>    </tr> </table> <b>Breakdown of Case Incident Type:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Incident Type</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Armed Robbery</td>       <td></td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CCTV Requests</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Exploitation / Grooming</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Pornography Enquiry</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>212</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Criminal Damage</td>       <td>4</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cyber Crime - Cyber Attacks</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Data Retrieval</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Denial of Service</td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Disclosure of Personal Data</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drug Offenses</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fraud Enquiry</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Harassment</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Human Trafficking</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Internal Affairs</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Internet Investigation</td>       <td>2</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Interpol Request</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Missing Person</td>       <td></td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Murder - Suspect</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Murder - Victim</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mutual Assistance Request</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Phishing Incident</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ransomware</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sexual Assault / Rape</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Telecommunications</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Terrorism</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Theft and Fraud Offences</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Unauthorised Access</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Website Defacement</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>400</td>       <td>490</td>       <td>166</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As this incident type was introduced in 2019, data is not available or comparable from any prior period.</p><p><b>Incidents of Accommodation Fraud</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022*</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>231</td>       <td>228</td>       <td>276</td>       <td>115</td>       <td>850</td>    </tr> </table> *  <i>Figures up to 05/05/2022</i></p><p><b>Monetary Value Seized</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022*</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;370,524</td>       <td>&euro;380,712</td>       <td>&euro;463,934</td>       <td>&euro;190,573</td>       <td>&euro;1,405,743</td>    </tr> </table> *<i>Figures up to 05/05/2022</i></p><p>It is worth noting that figures are operational and liable to change and are based on a reported date using data obtained from PULSE. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent law officer under the provisions of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 (as amended). The Office of the DPP is under the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach and I have no role in the functions of the Director or the Office of the DPP.  However, to be of assistance, I made enquiries with the Courts Service, regarding the number of prosecutions made as a result of accommodation fraud. The Courts Service have advised that there is no offence code for &ldquo;rental fraud&rdquo; and therefore the information sought by the Deputy cannot be provided. </p><p>I would encourage anyone who has been the victim of such crime to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can assure the Deputy that any incident of this type of crime will be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Furthermore, Garda management are continuously monitoring crime trends to identify persons who are engaged in such crimes. The Deputy may wish to note that advice is available on the Garda website for those who have fallen victim to accommodation fraud at the following link: </p><p><i>www.garda.ie/en/crime/fraud/i-believe-i-am-the-victim-of-rental-fraud-what-do-i-do-.html</i></p></reply>

While this harm can never be fully undone, I am strongly committed to bringing to Government and publishing a scheme to disregard convictions for qualifying offences prior to decriminalisation in 1993.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank the members of the Working Group for the important work which they are doing in considering a range of complex issues relating to the development of such a scheme. I decided to publish the progress report in order to highlight the good progress made to date and to draw attention to the key issues identified which both the group and I believe would benefit from a final round of targeted public consultation prior to finalisation of our proposals.</p>  <p>  The Working Group consists of representatives from my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC), the Office of the Attorney General and three members of the LGBTI+ community with expertise in this area.</p>  <p>  The report identifies progress made by the group to date on a number of key issues, as well as proposed next steps. Some of these key issues include identifying appropriate records, what happens to records, criteria for a conviction to be eligible for a disregard, and offences to be included under the disregard scheme.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the proposed public consultation is to allow representative organisations and affected people to provide input, based on their lived experience, on a number of key issues identified by the Working Group as requiring further input from affected communities, which will inform the Group&rsquo;s final deliberations, and ensure more effective policy making and implementation.</p>  <p>  The public consultation will be launched in the coming weeks. As set out in Justice Plan 2022, the final report of the Working Group is scheduled for submission to me by the end of Q3 2022, subject to the conclusion and outcome of the consultation process.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>   In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  It is open to the applicants to contact the Citizenship Division of my Department at: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie at any time for an update on their application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This report set out the capacity requirements for health-funded disability services for the period up to 2032. In order to drive the process of implementing the recommendations of the Capacity Review, a Working Group was set up to develop an Action Plan for Disability Services for the period 2022-2025. This Group, whose membership consisted of senior officials from the Departments of DCEDIY, Social Protection, Housing, Further and Higher Education, Health, and the Health Service Executive, has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan is currently being finalised for approval.</p>  <p>  In recent years, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;105 million is being provided for new disability measures this year under Budget 2022.

I asked for clarity on the staffing (e.g. consultants) available over the weekend. I also sought details of the level of discharges and diagnostics over the preceding fortnight to identify if there was a change in patterns over the weekend.</p>  <p>  I asked to receive a preliminary report by the end of this week.

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. 6846 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law.</p><p>Pharmacy technicians are employed and play an important role in many pharmacies, supporting the operation of the pharmacy and the work of pharmacists, and make a valuable contribution to pharmacy service delivery. In Ireland, however, there is no definition of &ldquo;pharmacy technician&rdquo; in legislation, and technicians are not subject to a statutory professional regulatory regime, nor is the qualification standardised across the various providers of pharmacy technician education and training.</p><p>I understand that currently there are reports to the PSI of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy, and indicate that this is being driven in part by an increasing number of pharmacists choosing to work in a locum capacity. This has a knock-on impact on pharmacist vacancies, and potentially on continuity and consistency of service. The PSI has been liaising with<b></b>stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support in efforts in understanding and addressing the issue in the short term, the results of which are pending. I understand that the IPU are seeking to establish a stakeholder group to examine the issue.</p><p>The PSI is currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;.</p><p>The European commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.</p><p>This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries. However, robust data for Ireland is needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future. It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.1700.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000089#WRDD02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 689 and 690 together.</p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of all medicines taking account of a range of objective factors, clinical benefits, cost effectiveness and expert opinion as appropriate.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, any inputs provided by the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need. The overriding factor in medicines, including orphan medicines, making it through the process to reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and 19 of the 52 new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals.</p>  <p>  The pipeline of new medicines coming to market remains strong and this government wants to secure fast access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients, including those for the treatment of rare diseases. The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan new medicines this year.</p>  <p>  To date in 2022, 24 approvals for reimbursement have been progressed by the HSE. There are a further 125 applications for reimbursement of new medicines in process with the HSE. A number of the medicines undergoing assessment currently have orphan designation and the HSE anticipates that a number of medicines with orphan status may be approved throughout 2022.</p>  <p>  The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) is the European Medicine Agency&rsquo;s committee responsible for recommending orphan designation of medicines for rare diseases. The European Commission decides whether to grant an orphan designation for the medicine based on the COMP's opinion. The HSE does not maintain a register of which medicines are designated orphan drugs, as the orphan status for a drug is subject to change at European level.</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme. This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population. Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. The pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE; </p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The City of Dublin Youth Services Board (CDYSB), and the HSE (CHO Dublin North City and County) act as channels of funding for the administration of this funding to front line drug and alcohol projects. CDYSB administer in the region of &euro;394,856 to four front line drug and alcohol projects in NIC on behalf of the Department of Health. The HSE acts as a channel of funding for the distribution and oversight of &euro;2.025m in funding to services in the NIC.</p><p>The Department has asked the HSE and the CDYSB to provide reassurance to the front-line services that funding will continue in 2022. In this regard, the Department understands that HSE has recently met with each of the funded organisations as part of the annual Service Level/Grant Aid Agreement process.</p><p>In 2021, the HSE allocated &euro;244,473 for the NICDATF company for office programmes and resources. The HSE holds a Service Level Arrangement (SLA) with the company for the delivery of these activities.  The Department understands that the HSE met with the company on 13<sup>th</sup>January and again on 10<sup>th</sup>March in relation to service delivery issues, including the parameters of funding in 2022 that could be provided to the company. It was agreed that a work plan could not be developed while the task forces is not functioning. Consideration will now be given to re-allocating the funding of &euro;224,000 for the provision of drug and alcohol services in the north inner city. </p><p>The Department of Health remains committed to addressing the drug and alcohol issues affecting the north inner city in conjunction with community-based service providers and has provide significant additional resources in Budget 2022 for drug and alcohol services in the area and north Dublin region. </p><p>The Department is continuing to work with stakeholders in the north inner city to establish effective, inclusive, and transparent governance of the task force and of the funding that it allocates. It is currently engaged in a consultation process with members of the task force and other stakeholders on the next steps.</p><p>The Department has recently met with local councillors from Dublin City Council, and with front line services funded under the ambit of the CDYSB and the HSE to get their views. Further meetings with stakeholders are planned.</p><p>I look forward to getting a report on the consultation process and to identify the next steps to establish effective, inclusive, and transparent governance of the task force in the north inner city.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force meets regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The NTPF have provided the information in the attached document.

Put simply, the aim of such an instrument is to protect public health and to help save lives in the event of future pandemics.</p>  <p>  An Intergovernmental Negotiating Body has been established and met for the first time on 24 February 2022. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is due to meet again by 1 August 2022 to discuss progress on a working draft of an agreement. A progress report is expected to be delivered to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim of adopting the instrument by 2024.</p>  <p>  As provided for in the Constitution, the conclusion of an international agreement is an exercise of the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations and is therefore concluded by or on the authority of the Government. In practice this means that Government approval must be sought for the signature, ratification or approval of every international agreement.</p>  <p>  As the proposed instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is currently in the very early stages of negotiation, it is not possible at this time to determine the precise legal ramifications of the instrument, nor has it been determined what form the instrument shall take.</p>  <p>  The requirements of the Irish Constitution will, of course, be respected in Ireland&rsquo;s position towards the negotiations and my Department will engage with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to any concerns that may arise in this regard.</p></reply>

The rate of assessment for rental properties will be reduced from 80% to 40% for income from all principal residences. </p>  <p>  This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8. It is expected that legislation will be brought forward in the coming months. The change will be made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage&rsquo;s Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine how the financial consequences of property rental will impact individual cases as each situation is different. Medical card eligibility notwithstanding, people aged 70 or older are automatically eligible for a GP visit card regardless of income, while the financial burden of continuing health care can be mitigated by other schemes such as the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) and the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI). In certain circumstances a person may also retain entitlement to a discretionary medical card. Please note under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.  Nursing home residents and their representatives will need to carefully consider their personal circumstances and the potential consequences of their decisions in this regard and it is advisable to make an informed decision before making a commitment to rent their property. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that Fair Deal participants are under no obligation to make their homes available for rental if they do not wish to do so. However, if income were derived from any rental agreement, it would be necessary to notify the HSE in order to re-evaluate the relevant person's financial assessment and entitlement to a medical card.</p></reply>

At my request, officials met with the Health Committee in private session in March to collaboratively discuss options for overcoming the challenges that have been identified by the Department.  I understand that it was a positive session and that the Committee are very supportive of the work and are also keen to progress the legislation. Officials have listened carefully to the views and inputs of the Committee and will consider these views with regard to their ongoing work on this matter.</p>  <p>  With regard to the request for advice, legal advice is confidential and privileged, and therefore cannot be shared. However, at the Health Committee meeting, officials outlined the complexities involved in progressing robust legislation on this matter. I outlined these complexities in the Seanad on 10th November 2021 as outlined in the transcript of that debate (available here  www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/seanad/2021-11-10/15/).</p>  <p>  This issue is a priority me. My Department is working to address the challenges associated with legislating for safe access to termination of pregnancy services and, subject to Government approval, I plan to have proposals for safe access on the legislative programme this year.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at<i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </i></p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above front-line workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

It is vital that our health services take steps to ensure serious adverse events in maternity care are appropriately reviewed and responded to at a national level.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Incident Management Framework was launched in 2018 and updated in 2020 and is applied to the management of individual incidents. In addition to these processes, the HSE Obstetric Event Support Team (OEST) is a new initiative which was established in 2022 to establish a team within the National Women and Infant Health Programme (NWIHP) to provide objective oversight over a specified list of obstetric clinical incidents occurring within Maternity Networks. The OEST has an initial staffing requirement of 4 Whole-time Equivalents (WTEs) including a Clinical Director, Midwife and case managers. Funding of &euro;540,000 was provided to support the establishment and expansion of the OEST from Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  The aim of the OEST is to support the networks as they respond to the events in terms of overseeing and advising on appointment of the review panel, family engagement, conduct of the review, finalisation of the review report and follow up. In addition to assisting the health services in responding to severe maternity related incidents and in the provision of appropriate supports for patients and families, the OEST aims to ensure appropriate expert level support is available nationally by enabling learning from adverse maternity incidents to be actioned at a national level and by promoting engagement with relevant stakeholders across the maternity network. It is anticipated that this will lead to safer and improved high-quality of care for patients and families.</p></reply>

'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Sections 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. </p>  <p>  The improvement of Advocacy supports is a key objective of the HSE Service Plan 2022.There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>  <p>  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.  </p>  <p>  Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions. The Irish Advocacy Network provides peer advocacy supports to people with mental health difficulties which can be accessed on a self-referral basis.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 provided &euro;20 million for the establishment of a ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund to support service delivery which focuses on prevention, community care and integration of care across all health and social care settings. The SIF supported 123 HSE and NGO sector projects, to test and evaluate innovative models of care providing a 'proof of concept' with a view to mainstreaming/scaling of successful projects through the annual budget estimates process.</p>  <p>  The current status of the 123 SIF projects is as follows; 106 projects are mainstreamed (which means they will receive recurring funding annually), two projects have received once off funding to facilitate reviews by HSE in 2022, two projects were granted a funded extension to facilitate completion of review in 2022 by my Department, and 13 Projects have completed.</p>  <p>  An End of Programme Report on the operation of the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund is being finalised and is expected to be published in the near future.</p></reply>

Persons who hold a medical card or a GP visit card are not subject to any co-payments or other charges in respect of such services including GP consultations.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services (blood tests) is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. Clinical determinations as to whether a blood test should taken to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition are made by the GP concerned. There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for such blood tests. In addition, blood tests undertaken in the context of services provided under the GP Chronic Disease Management programme are covered by the fees paid to GPs by the HSE for this care. </p>  <p>  The issue has been raised previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  Where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, or has been charged for a blood test provided under the Chronic Disease Management programme, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html.</p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above front-line workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p></reply>

It is important that anyone with concerns about cancer visit their GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p><p>The number of people coming forward with cancer concerns decreased significantly during Covid Wave 1 from March to May 2020.

Funding of &euro;5m has been provided in 2022 to continue the work of supporting cancer services and increasing capacity in the context of Covid-19. This is in addition to the &euro;12m allocated in 2021. This funding is facilitating additional clinics and the extension of clinic times, as well as allowing for minor infrastructural works to be carried out and for locum and temporary staff to be recruited to support the delivery of services. </p><p>In addition, there has been significant investment over the last two years for implementation of the National Cancer Strategy, with &euro;20m provided in 2021 and a further &euro;20m in 2022. This funding is being utilised to advance the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and to provide continued support for patients living with and beyond cancer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-10a.2024.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051000096#WRLL02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 801 to 803, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Medical Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of doctors in Ireland. In order to protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practise medicine in Ireland are safe to do so and meet the requirements to practise as set out in legislation.Officials from my Department have been in regular contact with the Council to examine the ways in which support can be provided to doctors arriving from Ukraine and to ensure that practitioners can be assisted and facilitated in gaining registration where possible. The Council is working with a range of stakeholders in this regard including the HSE, Postgraduate Training Bodies and the Irish Medical Schools Council. </p>  <p>  The HSE, through the National Doctors Training &amp;amp; Planning Unit (NDTP), in partnership with the Council and the Postgraduate Training Bodies, is coordinating an information gathering process which is collating information about healthcare professionals who are coming to Ireland. This data collection process is ongoing and will assist the relevant bodies in supporting these doctors and enable them to contact the individual doctors directly. The HSE is also looking at other options which these doctors can avail of while registration is pending, such as medical translation and access to CPD resources. </p>  <p>  I recognise that practitioners seeking registration face significant fees and for refugees arriving from Ukraine it may be particularly challenging to meet these costs. This is an issue which is being actively considered by my Department, the Medical Council and the other health profession regulators all of whom recognise the need to provide support to applicants. </p>  <p>  The selection of examinations for establishing medical education standards is a matter for the Medical Council. I have been advised that when the Medical Council determined the international exams suitable for the purpose of PRES Level 2 (UK, USA, Australia and Canada), there were a number of considerations including the similarities in the nature of medical education in those countries to that of Ireland.  These are seen as the best fit in determining the suitability for registration of a candidate who has not qualified here.  The Council has advised that acceptance of the Krok exam, which would enable access to the General Division of the register, would in effect be without any overall assessment of medical education in Ukraine.  This could seriously undermine the Council&rsquo;s ability to fulfil its patient safety remit. These are challenges which other EU Member States are also attempting to address. Officials from my Department form part of a coordination group established by the European Commission to examine the registration of Ukrainian health and social care professionals arriving in EU States as a result of the conflict. This group shares knowledge and best practice and is examining methods to streamline and expedite registration for these professionals, including the use of electronic databases, the EU information centres for academic recognition and machine translation tools.</p>  <p>  Registration in the Supervised Division is granted to doctors who have been offered a post that has been approved by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which has specific supervisory arrangements. The Council cannot grant registration in the Supervised Division until the HSE has confirmed there is a publicly funded post available. The information currently available indicates that the Supervised Division is not the optimum route at this time. I fully appreciate the importance of facilitating access to employment for doctors arriving to Ireland. My Department, along with the Medical Council and the HSE will continue to ensure that all avenues are being explored with a view to enabling Ukrainian qualified doctors to apply for registration, always conscious of the need to ensure that patient safety, is to the fore of any decisions regarding registration.</p></reply>

The MDR, which became fully applicable in May 2021, has an expanded scope, and will specifically include all dermal fillers, including those without a medical purpose, within its scope once the technical requirements (known as common specifications) for these products are in place. Once the common specifications are adopted, all dermal fillers will need to be certified as medical devices under the MDR and undergo a premarket assessment by an independent conformity assessment body (a Notified Body) before they can be CE marked and placed on the market. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) monitor the safety of medical devices in Ireland after they are placed on the market.  </p>  <p>  The MDR relates to the regulation of the medical device itself including matters such as safety and performance, as well as requirements for manufacturers of medical devices. It does not include provisions for the regulation of aspects relating to the use in practice or administration of the product, location of use, specific training or the qualifications of the individual administering the product. It is anticipated that the Department of Health will look at the wider aspects of the regulation of aesthetic procedures in 2022.</p>  <p>   The HPRA monitor the safety of medical devices placed on the market and assess their compliance with the applicable legislation. A medical device that is in conformity with the applicable legislation should bear a CE mark, indicating that it meets the basic requirements for safety and effectiveness under EU law and in some cases, this will involve a separate assessment by a &ldquo;Notified Body&rdquo; before the device can be placed on the market. HPRA operate a medical devices compliance programme, the objective of which is to ensure that the provisions of the medical devices legislation are complied with, to help ensure that public health and patient safety are protected.  Furthermore, the HPRA also operates a national incident reporting system for medical devices and users of medical devices are encouraged to report incidents or problems associated with their use, to the HPRA.  Further information relating to this can be found on the HPRA website. See www.hpra.ie/homepage/medical-devices/safety-information/reporting-safety-issues</p>  <p>  By way of additional information, with respect to cosmetic procedures, the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill will introduce a licensing scheme for acute hospitals and higher risk clinical health services provided in other settings. These high-risk activities provided outside of the hospital setting are referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;designated activities&rdquo;. Designated activities will be provided for by regulation and are likely to initially include cosmetic surgery services. Research has been and will be carried out in this area to ensure that an appropriate list of high risk designated activities are identified for inclusion within this licensing scheme.</p></reply>

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise. However, with restrictions eased, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy. The findings of this review are currently being examined as part of a deliberative process. The consideration of appropriate next steps will form part of this process.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place.</p></reply>

Put simply, the aim of such an instrument is to protect public health and to help save lives in the event of future pandemics.</p>  <p>  An Intergovernmental Negotiating Body has been established and met for the first time on 24 February 2022. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is due to meet again by 1 August 2022 to discuss progress on a working draft of an agreement. A progress report is expected to be delivered to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim of adopting the instrument by 2024.</p>  <p>  As provided for in the Constitution, the conclusion of an international agreement is an exercise of the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations and is therefore concluded by or on the authority of the Government. In practice this means that Government approval must be sought for the signature, ratification or approval of every international agreement.</p>  <p>  As the proposed instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is currently in the very early stages of negotiation, it is not possible at this time to determine the precise legal ramifications of the instrument, nor has it been determined what form the instrument shall take.</p>  <p>  The requirements of the Irish Constitution will, of course, be respected in Ireland&rsquo;s position towards the negotiations and my Department will engage with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to any concerns that may arise in this regard.</p></reply>

Inspections of these products take place at the Tivoli Container Terminal near Cork City. However, it should be noted that the physical infrastructure required for handling bulk wood products and that required for handling food products, are very different. </p>  <p>  The Port of Cork is currently developing new facilities at Ringaskiddy. Between 2015 and 2018, a number of meetings took place between my Department and the Port of Cork. In December 2018, the Port authority advised that they did not intend to pursue the building of a border control post at that time and they would consider that as a second phase of their development. They have since submitted a business case for the building of a border control post, capable of handling food products. </p>  <p>  As a border control post may only be located in a customs-controlled area, this business case can only be considered in the context of Revenue designating any place where it is proposed that a border control post will be built, as a customs-controlled area.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the focus of my Department has been on ensuring sufficient border control post infrastructure was available to deal with sanitary and phytosanitary goods being imported, into the European Union Single Market from Great Britain, following the Brexit Referendum. This involved a very substantial expansion of border control post infrastructure at Dublin Port, as well as the building of an interim facility at Rosslare Port. Work on plans for the building of a permanent facility in Rosslare Europort has recently been completed. </p>  <p>  The issue of whether an additional border control post might be required in Port of Cork remains under consideration and officials from my Department continue to analyse the requirements for this facility. </p></reply>

In particular, our approach has been informed by the three key principles - that the consultation be genuine and achieve real engagement, that it be targeted and easily accessible to those with a clear interest in the policy, and that systematic efforts are made to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to take part at all stages of the policy process.</p>  <p>  The development of the CSP has been underpinned by extensive stakeholder and public consultation carried out over the entire course of the Plan&rsquo;s development, including on:</p>  <p>  - the SWOT analysis in autumn 2019;</p>  <p>  - the Scoping Report for the Environmental Assessment in spring 2021;</p>  <p>  - the proposed interventions in August/September 2021; and</p>  <p>  - the Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment, which concluded on 8 December 2021. </p>  <p>  These activities have been complemented by the ongoing consultation that has taken place through the CAP Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which has met on thirty occasions since its establishment in May 2019, most recently on 29th April 2022. The Committee is comprised of representatives of Government Departments and agencies, farming organisations, environmental groups, industry and academia, and has contributed significantly to both the reform negotiation process and the development of the CSP. </p>  <p>  Stakeholder organisations have also been consulted by Ministers on a bilateral basis, as well as through in-person meetings, for example through the mart network after the lifting of COVID restrictions in late 2021. Most recently, my Department hosted a series of information sessions on the new CSP at eleven venues across the country, as well as an online webinar. There has also been regular bilateral engagement with other Departments, and with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  The draft CSP reflects the diverse views of stakeholders, and consultation will continue over the coming months as we reach the final stages of the European Commission's approval process.</p></reply>

In their recent report &lsquo;Forests and wood products, and their importance in climate change mitigation&rsquo; COFORD advised that 16,000 ha of annual afforestation is required if Ireland is to achieve the government target of 18% forest cover by 2050. </p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme which commenced in 2015 and has been extended to the end of 2022 provides significant supports for afforestation. This includes grants and premiums for 12 different planting categories to promote a good species mix and covers 100% of the cost of establishing a forest.  </p>  <p>  As the deputy may be aware, afforestation levels have been declining in recent years and Project Woodland was established in February 2021 to ensure that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland.  A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new Forestry Strategy are currently being developed. This new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027.  Supports will be included in the next Forestry Programme to incentivise afforestation. I am committed to working with all our stakeholders to substantially increase our afforestation rates over the next decade. </p>  <p>  I am aware that stakeholders, including COFORD, are calling for afforestation targets in excess of 8,000 ha. However, I am also aware that afforestation is a voluntary land use choice for landowners. Any target that is set must be realistic and we have set an ambitious target which is a significant step up from existing levels achieved in recent years.</p></reply>

This was the largest award of grant funding to animal welfare bodies ever made by my Department. Of this funding, &euro;2.9 million was awarded to 63 organisations that deal with the welfare and rehoming of dogs.</p>  <p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to promote responsible pet ownership.  This is currently being advanced by cross-divisional co-ordination within my Department on various aspects relating to pet ownership. Ireland&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025 - &ldquo;Working Together for Animal Welfare&rdquo; reflects the Programme for Government commitment on responsible pet ownership, and includes a commitment to establish an Advisory Council on Companion Animal Welfare (ACCAW). This multi-stakeholder Council convened in October 2021 and includes non-governmental organisations, individuals and professionals with a diverse range of skill sets and expertise to advise me on matters relating to companion animals. This Council will continue to provide me with expert advice on companion animal issues to guide policy-making.  </p></reply>

REAP incentivises farmers to maintain and improve the environmental condition of their land while delivering an important financial support to farmers.</p>  <p>  The programme will run to the end of 2022 and there are currently 3,645 participants in REAP, none of whom applied to afforest their land in April 2022.</p>  <p>  At applications stage, farmers could bring in between 2ha and 10ha of land with partnerships permitted to bring in up to 30ha.  </p>  <p>  Almost 32,000ha of land has been assessed and scored under the 2021 REAP programme to establish its environmental condition. Farmers will work with their advisers to undertake environmental improvement works on the land that can increase the environmental score in year two. REAP will focus on improving existing farm features rather than the creation of new features and habitats. Farms with higher environmental scores will receive larger payments.</p>  <p>  While parcels brought into REAP may not be converted to forestry during the term of the REAP contract, afforestation is fully compatible with REAP. REAP participants are subject to a maximum land area of 10ha for individual farmers and 30ha for partnerships of three farm holdings. </p>  <p>  The average REAP area under management per participant is 8.4ha.

The projects are being funded through the Brexit Adjustment Local Authority Marine Infrastructure Scheme. Donegal County Council is poised to receive over &euro;14 million based on the eligible project applications which the local authority itself identified and prioritised.  The remaining &euro;18 million in funding is allocated to projects put forward by 12 other coastal local authorities for a range of projects concerning piers, slipways and harbours in need of investment.  A further call for projects is planned for later in the year to allocate remaining funding identified for the scheme.  In the meantime I hope that each of the relevant local authorities is pressing forward with delivery of the approved projects so that the construction stimulus identified by the Seafood Taskforce is felt as soon as possible in coastal communities.</p></reply>

The forestry appeals are now up to date and this has allowed for additional resources to be made available to agriculture appeals work.</p>  <p>  The easing of COVID restrictions in June 2021, which allowed for a return to in-person oral hearings, has also contributed to a reduction in delays in closing agriculture appeals in 2021 when compared to 2020 figures.
