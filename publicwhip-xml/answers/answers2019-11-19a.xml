This phase invited feedback on the NCCA's draft report on its review of RSE and, again, there was significant public engagement in this process.  The consultation took the form of an online survey, invitations to make written submissions, and a major seminar in Dublin Castle.</p>  <p>  I understand that the feedback arising from the NCCA consultation will be incorporated into a draft final report which will be considered by the members of the Council at its December 2019 meeting. I expect to receive the NCCA's report shortly after this, and it will be carefully considered by my Department.   </p>  <p>  I am aware of material that was circulated as part of a campaign of misinformation to spread misleading claims about what type of Relationships and Sex Education will be taught to young children in our schools. I have said publicly, and I repeat it here today, that these claims are untrue and also deeply unhelpful. They amount to malicious scaremongering.  </p>  <p>  Under no circumstances will my Department impose a curriculum whereby young children are exposed to instruction or information in relation to sexual activity that is inappropriate to their age.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Education and Skills, I am committed to ensuring that any RSE curriculum will be appropriate to the age and developmental stage of the children in our schools.</p>  <p>   It is vital that we provide future generations with an understanding of the importance of consent, the development of relationships, safe use of the internet and a healthy positive attitude to sexuality.</p></reply>

In that respect, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the process of selection of applicants for this framework has now been completed. </p>  <p>  The next steps involve the NDFA proceeding to the second phase of the appointment process which will involve a number of call-off competitions for bundles of projects from this framework.  Thereafter, the NDFA will ensure that the project progresses to design stage, obtains the necessary statutory planning permission, and moves the project onward to tender and construction in due course. As the project is at an early stage in the delivery process, it is not possible at this time to give a date for its completion. </p>  <p>  Please be assured that the NDFA will be engaging directly with the school authority to keep it informed of progress.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area, including the area to which the Deputy refers. While the announcement did not include a new school for the school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. </p>  <p>  This area was also one surveyed in 2013 as part of the patronage divesting process.  The outcome was that there was sufficient parental demand for a multi-denominational school.  My Department is continuing its efforts in relation to identifying a suitable solution under the patronage divesting process.</p></reply>

It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The local Special Education Needs Organisers in Cork are available to assist and advise to parents of children with special educational needs and identify available school places.</p></reply>

Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October. </p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.  </p>  <p>  As well as this, a design solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  </p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.  Details will continue to be communicated to the schools as my Department&rsquo;s plans develop and progress.  </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge that remediation is a disruptive process for the schools involved and I want to thank all those connected with the affected schools for their continued patience and understanding as we roll out our plans to fix the problems that have emerged.</p>  <p>  Schools, patrons, principals, teachers, students and parents should be assured that, since these issues were identified, safety is the number one priority for my Department and we are committed to remediating these schools to the highest possible standard.</p></reply>

In addition to securing the necessary statutory approvals it also includes the preparation of complex and detailed tender documents.  In completing Stage 2(b), Design Teams are now required to upgrade design details to ensure that new school buildings are Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) in compliance with the 2017 amendment to Part L of the current Building Regulations. In many cases this has involved a second planning application to allow for the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roof following receipt of the initial planning permission.</p>  <p>  Other factors that can impact on progress during Stage 2B can include complicated or detailed planning applications, appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, complications around decant arrangements, issues relating to the site and/or challenges to the Prequalification of Contractors process.</p>  <p>  Through its structured approach in facilitating the progression of projects, my Department will ensure that the focus on the expeditious delivery of the school building programme continues in accordance with the terms and provisions of the NDP funding envelope.  The current status of projects being delivered is listed on a county by county basis on the Department's website and updated on a monthly basis to reflect progress through design, tender and construction.</p></reply>

This represents approx. 20% of the overall school population.  (691 primary (231 Urban Band 1; 104 Urban Band 2; 358 Rural) and 198 post primary. My Department will spend in the region of &euro;125 million in 2019 on the DEIS programme. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, following the review of DEIS, my Department introduced an objective, statistics based model for assessing which schools merited inclusion in the DEIS Programme. Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  All schools at both Primary and Post Primary level are being assessed using this new methodology based on their enrolments from 2018/19 and the latest data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index.  The accuracy of address data is vital to this process and an Eircode lookup function was added to the Primary and Post Primary Online Databases earlier this year to facilitate this. </p>  <p>  Following a detailed analysis of the quality of the data, my Department is now in the final stages of further data analysis on the new identification model to allow for the development of a resource allocation model to match resources to identified need. This analysis is being carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with the relevant stakeholders will follow.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the culmination of this analysis will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), the Government in recognising the need to share in the international responsibility to address the increasingly global challenges we face, launched  The Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2030, a whole-of-Government initiative to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. This is informed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many complementary themes can be identified between the Government&rsquo;s National Implementation Plan for SDGs and the ESD Strategy in, for instance, areas such as awareness raising and sustainability in action.</p>  <p>  The ESD strategy aims to ensure that education contributes to sustainable development by equipping learners with the relevant knowledge (the &lsquo;what&rsquo;), the key dispositions and skills (the &lsquo;how&rsquo;) and the values (the &lsquo;why&rsquo;) that will motivate and empower them throughout their lives to become informed active citizens who take action for a more sustainable future.  This is achieved through the integration of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the curriculum, into Initial Teacher Education and teacher CPD, into assessment and into the inspection process. </p>  <p>  An Interim Review of the ESD Strategy was completed in 2018 and the report is available on the Departments website: www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Education-for-Sustainable-Development/Education-for-Sustainable-Development.html.</p>  <p>  The NCCA conducted an audit: Education for Sustainable Development: A study of the opportunities and linkages in the primary and post-primary curriculum (2017). The audit identified key ways in which the curriculum supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>  <p>  The full audit is available at the link:</p>  <p>   www.ncca.ie/en/resources/education-for-sustainable-development-a-study-of-the-opportunities-and-linkages-in-the-primary-and-post-primary-curriculum.</p>  <p>  The SEAI will develop a Junior Cycle short course on Climate Action under the National Climate Action Plan.

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.   My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer / Board of Management.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p>  <p>  www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0076_2018.pdf.</p>  <p>  www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0077_2018.pdf.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

The purpose of the demonstration project is to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports that allows for early intervention in terms of providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complements existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services. </p>  <p>  - Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 200% from 548 to 1,621 for 2019/2020 school year. 167 new special classes have been established nationally for 2019/20 school year. This includes special classes for mild, moderate and severe/profound learning disabilities.</p>  <p>  - 124 special schools providing specialist education for approximately 7,500 pupils annually with over 1,400 teachers. Budget 2020 provides for an additional 23 teaching posts for special schools, designed to meet expected increases in enrolments in 2020, providing over 8,000 pupil places in special schools. It also provides for the continued provision of administrative deputy principal posts in special schools with 15+ teaching posts, introduced in special schools for the first time this September.</p>  <p>  - The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. This Policy Advice is to be completed and a report submitted to the Minister no later than June 2020. A progress report has been submitted to me, and this is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  - Other supports provides for assistive technology supports and equipment, special school transport arrangements including additional transport assistance such as bus escorts; teacher training and continuing professional development in the area of special education; enhanced capitation levels for special schools and special classes and modification of school buildings to assist with access and new build provisions to ensure inclusive settings in newly built schools.</p>  <p>  - The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) includes a new Inclusion Support Service within the NCSE to support the inclusion of children with special educational needs in schools.</p>  <p>  - A Home Tuition scheme provides for the education of children with special educational needs who are awaiting school placement and the July provision provides for an extended school year scheme.</p>  <p>  - Special Arrangements for State Examinations &ndash; reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs to participate in state exams. </p>  <p>  The number of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels and so too is the number of children receiving support across the continuum that includes mainstream classes, special classes and special schools. The Department&rsquo;s commitment is to provide each child with an education in accordance with his/her needs. </p>  <p>  Increased investment in teachers, SNAs, therapeutic and other supports reflects the priority which is put on helping children with special educational needs to fulfil their potential. </p>  <p>  The investment also reflects the growing participation of children with Special Educational Needs in the education system and the capacity of the education system to better support their full participation and progression.</p></reply>

This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Additionally pupils with developmental issues may require an assessment of need, which is provided by the HSE services. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with difficulties including those with developmental delay. Teachers consult with their NEPS psychologist for assistance should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become directly involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological support. I would advise that parents of children in schools for whom concerns exist in relation to developmental delay should, in the first instance, raise the matter with the principal of the relevant school with a view to involving the assigned NEPS psychologist in the issue, where appropriate.</p></reply>

One of its specific objectives is to increase access by students from target groups to initial teacher education (ITE). The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund supports innovative approaches to delivering the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP).</p>  <p>  PATH 1 funding of &euro;2.7m supports the objective in NAP to increase access to initial teacher education for students from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan such as Lone Parents, Travellers and students with a disability.  Under PATH 1, the Department, through the HEA, invited six centres of teaching excellence, in partnership with relevant local stakeholders, to compete for PATH 1 funding by submitting proposals in accordance with a set of prescribed criteria. Funding was secured by the six centres of teaching excellence in 2017 to fund initiatives and these initiatives are now underway.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;50,000 over three years, 2019-2021, towards the Migrant Teacher project, which has been funded under the National Integration Strategy.  The Migrant Teacher Project, based in Marino Institute of Education, was established in 2017 to increase the participation of immigrant internationally educated teachers in the Irish primary and post-primary education sectors.  The Migrant Teacher Project aims to work with immigrant teachers to support them through the process of registration and seeking employment.  </p>  <p>  Finally, work by the Teaching Council to streamline the process for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside of the State, has been taken forward under the Teacher Supply Action Plan. As part of this work, the Council has engaged in a process of reviewing the Curricular Subject Requirements at Post-primary level with the aim of maintaining and protecting the standard while increasing flexibility in the system, thus helping to ensure that Ireland can welcome the diverse range of skills that foreign graduates bring to the modern learning environment.</p></reply>

The HCI will invest &euro;300 million in Higher Education over the period 2020 to 2024. Funded from the surplus in the National Training Fund, the HCI will help to realise the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, Future Jobs Ireland and the National Skills Strategy. At &euro;60 million per year over the next 5 years, it will form a key part of our strategic response to addressing the skills needs of the economy,  mitigating Brexit risks, responding to digitalisation and the future world of work, and preparing ourselves for other challenges that the economy may face. </p>  <p>  I am confident that innovative initiatives such as this and the significant additional funding already committed are delivering real benefits on the ground.  However there is always a need to look to the future.  This is why I am progressing the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education.  This is essential in light of the centrality of higher education - both in terms of human capital development, research and innovation - to underpinning the future development of Ireland as a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.      </p>  <p>  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is now commencing supported under the European Commission Structural Reform Support Programme to be undertaken by an expert independent international consortium.   We expect to have substantial work on this project completed by Quarter 3 in 2020. </p>  <p>  The comprehensive and detailed analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance between provision across the tertiary education system is expected to play a very important role in informing and advising Government decision-making.  It will provide the basis for a national consensus on the appropriate policy approach which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability and progress and the delivery of key policy objectives under Project Ireland 2040 and Future Jobs Ireland.</p></reply>

The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>Budget 2020 is the third successive budget to provide for an increase in the number of principal release days.   One additional release day will be allocated to each school with a teaching principal with effect from 1st   September 2020.  This will bring the number of release days to 19, 25 and 31, depending on the size of school.  This is an increase from 14, 18 and 22 days since 2015.  In addition, a further four additional release days are allocated to schools with special classes.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increase of release days, the Government lifted the moratorium on middle management posts in 2017.  In total almost 1300 leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since 2017 which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  My Department has committed to revising the number of available Posts of Responsibility to take account of retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibilities are maintained in the school system.</p></reply>

At both primary and post-primary levels considerable scope for building the capacity of students in the area of digital literacy is provided for through the emphasis on dispositions, competencies and skills as foundational elements of the curriculum. </p>  <p>  Specifically, in the newly introduced Framework for Junior Cycle digital literacy skills are promoted through the eight Key Skills (all skills have an ICT/digital component) and through the Statements of Learning. In addition, in the ongoing reviews of the Primary Curriculum, the new primary mathematics curriculum in particular, and of the Senior Cycle the skills of, or skills closely related to, digital literacy, have featured strongly in all discussions on future provision.  </p>  <p>  Currently at post-primary level, there are several programmes and courses in ICT and Digital Literacy already in place, particularly the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Literacy and the IT courses in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. The recently-introduced Leaving Certificate subject in Computer Science also looks at aspects of digital literacy. </p>  <p>  In studying the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Media Literacy, students learn to use digital technology, communication tools and the internet creatively, critically and safely, in support of their development, learning and capacity to participate effectively in social and community life.</p>  <p>  The Information and Communication Technology module forms part of the core curriculum for all Leaving Certificate Applied students. It is intended to develop the students&rsquo; skills, knowledge, attitudes and understanding of Information and Communication Technology to enable them to use digital technology in both their current and future lives. </p>  <p>  The principles underpinning the Digital Strategy for Schools requires schools to embed digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment practices. This will help to further develop digital literacy skills for pupils and students in primary and post primary schools. The Digital Learning Framework for Schools, which commenced dissemination to all schools from September 2018provides guidance to schools on how best to embed digital technologies in their teaching and learning practices.  It is accompanied by an extensive professional development programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, areas such as Wellbeing and its constituent programmes in Social, Personal and Health Education, Relationships and Sexuality Education and Civic, Social and Political Education also underpin skills of digital literacy in engaging with the subject material in these courses.</p></reply>

Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October.</p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.   </p>  <p>  As well as this, a solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  </p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.  Details will continue to be communicated to the schools as my Department&rsquo;s plans develop and progress.  </p>  <p>  About &euro;40m has been spent this year up to the end of quarter 3 2019 on the remediation programme, covering the cost of investigations, precautionary measures, fire safety upgrades and structural repairs.   </p>  <p>  The cost to date is less than was initially estimated and this is largely due to the well-managed way in which the remediation programme has been handled. </p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code requires Government Departments to make contingency provision within their overall capital programme to meet any unforeseen demands or additional costs which might emerge for the capital programme as a whole.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this requirement, the cost for the schools remediation programme is being met to date through a contingency provision as part of the increased 2019 capital budget of &euro;942m and also from the reduced funding requirement for the multi-annual capital development in TU Dublin Grangegorman following the sale of DIT Kevin Street.   This approach does not undermine our commitment to planned school construction projects being delivered over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020 which will provide 70,000 school places and the 29 building projects being progressed at third level.</p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to pursue the original contractor, using all available contractual and legal channels, for the cost of implementing precautionary measures and remediation works in each of the schools.  Two cases are currently before the Commercial Court.  Those are for Ardgillan Community College and Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School. My Department continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the on-going legal process related to the 40 schools built by the contractor.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.130.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900059#WRC03200"><p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of staff about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. </p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p><p>Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer / Board of Management.  </p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0076_2018.pdf.</i></p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0077_2018.pdf.</i></p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p><p>On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

NABMSE expect an outcome to this process in the coming weeks. </p><p>It is hoped that a speedy and cost effective resolution can be secured for impacted special schools, and the outcome of the NABMSE group scheme is awaited in this regard.</p><p>The special school to which the Deputy refers is not among the special schools that have made contact with my Department to date in relation to insurance issues. </p><p>It is not sustainable however for my Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums. </p><p>I know that this is a cause of concern to schools as well and it is my hope that a speedy and cost effective resolution can be secured for impacted special schools.</p></reply>

They are valued in their communities in that they provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activity.</p>  <p>  The majority of rural schools (over 1,200) are classed as small- having 4 or fewer teachers. Whilst facing the challenges and opportunities that all schools do, this particular group of schools has specific challenges. I have been listening to our partners around this and discussing what we can do to support small schools and ensure that they have a sustainable future. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents and I am honouring this partnership approach. </p>  <p>  I have spoken with international colleagues to hear their perspective and, together with my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural and Community Development, hosted a Symposium on Small Schools. I am actively engaging with the people and organisations who work in and with small schools and who understand the value and opportunities they offer to communities. </p>  <p>  We have already announced additional supports in Budget 2020. This record level of investment in the sector is providing for an extra release day for teaching principals and improved teaching staffing levels for small schools. The work now underway in relation to small schools seeks to build on this and is being advanced through the Primary Education Forum.  It is planned that policy supports for small schools will be developed to feed into the Estimates process for 2021. </p></reply>

The &ldquo;Scheme to Share Teachers between Recognised Post-Primary Schools&rdquo; is intended to ease recruitment pressures in specific subject areas such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish, and home economics. I would strongly encourage Principals and boards of management to take the opportunity provided by this scheme to work with a neighbouring school by sharing a teacher to ensure availability of these subject specialisms. Details of the scheme are set out in Circular 0015/2019, which is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The teacher sharing initiative is one of a range of actions contained in the Action Plan for Teacher Supply. Other actions in the plan include:</p>  <p>  - My Department launched the &ldquo;Teaching Transforms&rdquo; campaign (digital, radio and video) to promote the teaching profession, supported by a new dedicated webpage.</p>  <p>  - Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), the higher education institutions (HEIs) have put in place new initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 in a number of priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages, Irish and Computer Science. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are also planned to commence in September 2020.</p>  <p>  - The HEA is engaging with the HEIs to explore the development of programmes to upskill existing teachers in targeted post primary subject areas.</p>  <p>  - The Teaching Council has reviewed the implementation of student teacher school placement guidelines and a report on this is expected before the end of 2019 </p>  <p>  - Stakeholder consultative forums and focus groups for teachers, principals, parents, student teachers and school students have been held with further forums and focus groups planned over the coming school year to inform ongoing policy to address teacher supply challenges.</p>  <p>  - An online teacher recruitment portal to match available teachers with short term substitute vacancies in primary and post primary schools is being developed. Final testing is ongoing and it is intended that this portal will be operational shortly.     </p>  <p>  The Steering Group on Teacher Supply, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is overseeing the implementation of the Plan.

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer / Board of Management.  </p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p><p>On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

These range from one-day, unannounced incidental inspections, to more intensive whole-school evaluations and inspections that follow-through on how schools have implemented recommendations made in previous inspection reports. All inspection models focus on the quality of teaching, learning and pupil achievement. </p><p>Depending on the focus of the evaluation, they may also focus on the quality of support for pupils, the quality of action planning for school improvement and the quality of leadership and management.</p><p>The NCSE is an independent agency under the remit of my Department, with a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes andSpecial Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools;</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools;</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). The announcement followed nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  Dunshaughlin post-primary school planning area is catered for by Dunshaughlin Community College. The school operates under the patronage of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB) and has a current enrolment in the region of 1,000 pupils. The school is experiencing demand for additional school places and the LMETB is open to assisting in meeting this demand.  The ETB has submitted an application for additional accommodation which my Department is currently considering. The outcome will assist my Department in determining the future need in the area. In the meantime, my Department has approved the provision of additional temporary accommodation - 8 general classrooms and 1 science lab - to LMETB to meet the school&rsquo;s immediate needs.</p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Dunshaughlin school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

The HCI will invest &euro;300 million in Higher Education over the period 2020 to 2024. Funded from the surplus in the National Training Fund, the HCI will help to realise the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, Future Jobs Ireland and the National Skills Strategy. At &euro;60 million per year over the next 5 years, it will form a key part of our strategic response to addressing the skills needs of the economy,  mitigating Brexit risks, responding to digitalisation and the future world of work, and preparing ourselves for other challenges that the economy may face. </p>  <p>  The development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education - both in terms of human capital development, research and innovation - to underpinning the future development of Ireland as a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change.      </p>  <p>  In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is now commencing supported under the European Commission Structural Reform Support Programme to be undertaken by an expert independent international consortium.   We expect to have substantial work on this project completed by Quarter 3 in 2020. </p>  <p>  The comprehensive and detailed analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance between provision across the tertiary education system is expected to play a very important role in informing and advising Government decision-making.  It will provide the basis for a national consensus on the appropriate policy approach which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability and progress and the delivery of key policy objectives under Project Ireland 2040 and Future Jobs Ireland.</p></reply>

As a first step, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. All schools at both Primary and Post Primary are currently being assessed using the new identification model.   </p>  <p>  My Department is currently undertaking data analysis in the context of resource allocation to match identified need, including the examination of variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage.  This analysis is being carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with the relevant stakeholders will follow.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the culmination of this analysis will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need.</p></reply>

This scenario also applies to former members of the Permanent Defence Force who are in receipt of disability pensions under the Army Pensions Acts, including those amongst them whose disability pensions are in respect of post-traumatic stress disorder.  </p>  <p>   There is an ongoing administrative exercise over the course of the PSSA to review and adjust public service pension rates in line with current policy.  The next scheduled pay increase for public servants, including the Defence Forces, is 0.50% from 1 January 2020 (for those on basic pay of less than &euro;32,000 a year) and 2% from 1 October 2020.

Implementation of these specific actions is being carried out by civil-military teams on a phased basis over a ten-year period out to 2025. Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for a Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some projects and resourcing implications.

Officials from my Department in both Dublin and Belfast monitor this case as part of their engagement with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland on justice, security and prison matters. </p>  <p>  The persons concerned were convicted of murder by joint enterprise at their trial in 2012.  Their appeal against their convictions failed at the Belfast High Court in 2012 and in 2015, they were refused permission by the Supreme Court in London to mount a further appeal. </p>  <p>  The case is now being looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is an independent public body that is responsible for reviewing possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  It is important that we respect the legal process and allow time for it to reach its conclusion. At this stage in the proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  </p>  <p>  My officials in the Irish Secretariat in Belfast regularly engage with a wide range of bodies on justice and security matters in Northern Ireland, including the NI Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, the NI Police Ombudsman, and the NI Prisoner Ombudsman.  Security cooperation has also formed a key part of my discussions with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, and his predecessor Karen Bradley, including at the last meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in May. </p>  <p>  Officials will continue to monitor developments in this case and the Government will take action as appropriate. It is of course regrettable that, in the absence of a devolved Assembly and a functioning Executive, we do not have a locally elected and accountable Justice Minister with whom we could engage with on matters such as this.</p></reply>

There was a broad agreement in relation to the need for a political solution in the country and on the importance of an inclusive, Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process.  </p>  <p>  Following this, the Council discussed regional security in the Gulf and Iran. I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concern regarding Iran&rsquo;s latest breaches of its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

International law is clear that Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal, and Ireland and the EU have made their views on settlements known on multiple occasions. Most relevantly to this case, under international law they are not part of the State of Israel. </p>  <p>  Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. In the specific case of the occupied Palestinian territory, an Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin was published by the European Commission on 12 November 2015. This provides guidance to importers and retailers on how EU rules on place of origin labelling should be applied in this case. </p>  <p>  In relation to the case referred to the Court of Justice in June 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, found that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. </p>  <p>  The Court of Justice&rsquo;s ruling is an interpretation of France&rsquo;s implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s Notice and associated EU Regulations. It essentially does not change the situation. However, my Department is currently examining the judgment and reflecting on whether there are implications for Ireland. We will consult, if required, with other Departments in the coming period. </p>  <p>  The Commission Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin of 12 November 2015 is already on my Department&rsquo;s website. It was circulated to other Departments at the time of publication to bring the guidelines to the attention of relevant bodies dealing with labelling or consumer protection. Accuracy of product labelling will continue to be a consumer protection issue, monitored and enforced as heretofore.</p></reply>

The proportion of the property which each tenant in common holds will be specified in the deed which transferred ownership of the property to them. It appears on the basis of the information supplied that the tenants in common hold this property in unequal 60:40 shares, and presumably are entitled to any rental profits in the same ratio. </p>  <p>  The Irish income tax system is based on self-assessment.  Taxpayers are required to file tax returns stating their income and deducting any allowable losses, expenditures, reliefs, etc.  Taxpayers are taxed only on income earned or profits/gains made in a taxable period.  In this scenario, each tenant in common would be entitled to a share of the rental income in proportion with the share of the property they hold. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the proposal in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, which would appear not to be in keeping with the terms of the relevant tenancy in common, would not be appropriate. The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 does not provide that taxpayers can declare income, profits or gains to which they are not entitled; that one taxpayer would declare income which belongs to another taxpayer; or that taxpayer A would ask taxpayer B to declare income belonging to taxpayer A.  It would not be correct for one tenant to declare 100% of the rental income from a property when she/he was only entitled to a share of such income, and for the other tenant not to declare income to which she/he was entitled, and for which she/he is liable to tax. </p>  <p>  Also, if the tenants in common proceeded in the manner suggested, the tenant in common who did not declare any rental income may not be in a position to claim all the allowances, credits and reliefs to which she/he is entitled.</p></reply>

The percentage of interest allowed as a deduction for residential landlords was due to increase in 5% increments from 2017, until full deductibility was reached in 2021.</p><p>However, in Finance Act 2018, I provided for the restoration of full interest deductibility for all residential landlords. This measure took effect from 1 January 2019 and would be of benefit to many property owners in the position outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. </p><p>The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could, depending on individual circumstances, be nil, in which case no tax would be due on the rent.</p></reply>

On 1 February 2018, the Central Bank published the feedback statement on CP109 and amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions. These amending regulations have been applicable to credit unions since 1 March 2018.  Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to invest in a range of specified investment classes, which includes &lsquo;Investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHB)s&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Regulations permitting this investment class commenced on 1 March 2018. Since this date, credit unions have been permitted to invest in regulated investment vehicles where the underlying investments of the regulated investment vehicle are investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies in for the provision of social housing. The Regulations require that investments by credit unions in Tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit unions regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit unions regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  As such the Government and the Central Bank have fulfilled their role and it is now up to both the credit union and social housing sectors themselves to progress and develop any specific funding mechanisms. Notwithstanding the above, my Department will continue to engage with the credit union movement on appropriate mechanisms for them to establish a vehicle to invest in approved housing bodies.</p></reply>

It states that a credit union shall manage its investments to ensure that those investments do not (taking account of the nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of the credit union) involve undue risk to members' savings and, for that purpose, before making an investment a credit union shall assess the potential impact on the credit union, including the impact on the liquidity and financial position of the credit union. Section 43(3) provides the Central Bank with the power to make regulations in relation to investments.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions. In May 2017, Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) was published which consulted on a number of potential changes to the investment framework. CP109 outlined the Central Bank&rsquo;s view that any changes to the investment framework for credit unions should reflect the fact that it is the savings of credit union members (which can be withdrawn on demand) that will be invested by credit unions and that the risk profile of credit union investment portfolios should reflect this.</p>  <p>  On 1 February 2018, the Central Bank published the feedback statement on CP109 and amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions. These amending regulations have been applicable to credit unions since 1 March 2018. These regulations reflect a change to the definition of bank bonds which precludes investment by a credit union in bonds that are subordinated to any other liability of a credit institution  in recognition of their risk profile and complexity. It is not deemed appropriate for credit unions to be holders of instruments such as subordinated bank bonds specifically designed to absorb losses in a resolution scenario as it would directly expose them to burden sharing in line with EU Commission policy, reflected in the resolution framework introduced under the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive BRRD. This preclusion for credit unions reflects the potential implications for credit unions should such instruments be written down or converted to equity upon the failure of a credit institution.</p>  <p>  Credit unions continue to be permitted to invest in senior bank bonds.   </p></reply>

It is also important to note that the Probate Office of the High Court deals with matters relating to probate and as such is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that under section 21 of the Credit Union Act 1997 (1997 Act) as amended, a credit union member may nominate a third party (e.g. a family member) to be the recipient upon the death of the member to the whole or part of the member&rsquo;s property that they have in the credit union at the time of their death.</p><p>The 1997 Act (as amended) imposes a statutory limit of &euro;23,000 on the amount that can be passed by way of a nomination. Thus, if at the date of the nominator's death the amount of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union exceeds &euro;23,000, the credit union may only dispose any property up to the value of &euro;23,000. The effect of these provisions are that any nomination up to &euro;23,000 will pass outside the terms of any will. Any sum in excess of this will revert to and be an asset of the estate, which needs to be distributed under the terms of the will or the rules of succession where there is no will.</p><p>Ordinarily the production of a grant of probate would be required to release funds from a bank account to the personal representative, irrespective of the amount. However, if a person dies leaving small amounts of money in a bank, the bank may agree to release the funds without the necessity for a grant of probate.</p><p>While most applicants instruct a solicitor to process their application for a grant of probate, personal applications can also be made to the Probate Office of the High Court for a grant of probate.</p><p>The Central Bank has also advised me that in order to be registered a credit union must have a set of rules. Under section 15 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 the registered rules of a credit union bind all members. In some cases these rules specifically set out the credit union's approach to the nomination of property and the statutory limit under the 1997 Act.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that if an individual is not satisfied in any of their dealings with a financial services provider the individual may make a complaint to the provider&rsquo;s internal complaint resolution process. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, they can then make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the complainant. Further information on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman can be found at <i>www.fspo.ie</i>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.274.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900061#WRE05600"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation in Ireland.  I have no role in day to day supervision of the insurance industry, as this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). In that regard, the CBI is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of these undertakings in Ireland.  All insurance companies operating in Ireland, whether authorised by the Central Bank or a competent authority of another EU state, are subject to conduct of business supervision by the CBI.  They must follow the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Consumer Protection Code 2012</i>(CPC).  </p><p>In relation to the issue of auto-renewals for insurance policies, I cannot comment on the individual case referenced in the details supplied.  However, I understand that, at a general level, this is something that a number of companies in the market include as part of their terms of business, in particular for certain types of insurance policies such as gadget, bicycle, pet and annual travel insurance.  I also understand that where a non-life insurance policy contract includes such an automatic renewal service, this is generally made clear to the consumer at the outset and, as stated, is included in the terms of business related to the policy contract.  </p><p>My officials consulted with the Central Bank of Ireland on this particular issue.  They advised that provisions 4.30 and 4.31 of the CPC provide that:</p><p>4.30:</p> <blockquote> 	  	&ldquo;A regulated entity providing an insurance quotation to a consumer must include the following information in the quotation, assuming that all details provided by the consumer are correct and do not change:  <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	a) the monetary amount of the quotation; <br /><br />b) the length of time for which the quotation is valid; and <br /><br />c) the full legal name of the relevant underwriter.&rdquo; </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>4.31:</p> <blockquote> 	  	&ldquo;A regulated entity must set out clearly in the quotation provided to the consumer any warranties or endorsements that apply to the policy. Where the quotation is provided on paper or on another durable medium, this information must not be in a smaller font size than other information provided in the document.&rdquo;  </blockquote>  <p>In addition, the <i>Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007</i>provides that the insurer shall, not less than 20 working days prior to the date of expiry of a policy of insurance, where the insurer wishes to invite a renewal, issue to the client in writing a notification of renewal of the policy of insurance.  Moreover , Schedule 3 of the <i>Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1995</i>sets out the indicative list of terms which may be regarded as unfair. Part (h) cites terms &ldquo;automatically extending a contract of fixed duration where the consumer does not indicate otherwise, when the deadline fixed for the consumer to express this desire not to extend the contract is unreasonably early&rdquo; as being unfair.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that there are measures in the CPC that require all regulated financial services firms to have complaints handling procedures in place.  Neither my Department, nor the CBI, investigates individual consumer complaints however, if a person feels that they have been unfairly treated by an insurance company, and after following the firm&rsquo;s complaints process, they are still not satisfied, they have the right to refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  This is a statutory independent body that mediates unresolved disputes/complaints with regulated financial services providers. Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

Other Ministers are responsible for the non-pay terms and conditions in the wider public service.</p>  <p>   The campaign for a 4 day week relates to a significant change to working time in Ireland for the entire workforce - Civil Service, wider public sector and private sector. In terms of the Civil Service position as an employer in relation to the 4 day week, significant research would need to be undertaken as to the feasibility of this, taking into consideration factors such as service provision to the public and any potential additional costs to the Exchequer, including as you mention, whether it would result in any additional headcount being required.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service is currently a leading employer in the field of flexible working. Approximately 17% of the Civil Service workforce are currently on flexible work arrangements that include work-sharing and shorter worker year. Civil servants can also apply for career breaks which allows us, the Civil Service, to retain staff in cases where they need some time away from work to focus on other opportunities. Some departments also offer e-working.</p></reply>

Partial structural remediation was carried out in another school. Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October.  </p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.   </p>  <p>  As well as this, a solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  </p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.  Details will continue to be communicated to the schools as my Department&rsquo;s plans develop and progress.  </p>  <p>  About &euro;40m has been spent this year up to the end of quarter 3 2019 on the remediation programme, covering the cost of investigations, precautionary measures, fire safety upgrades and structural repairs.   </p>  <p>  The cost to date is less than was initially estimated and this is largely due to the well-managed way in which the remediation programme has been handled. </p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code requires Government Departments to make contingency provision within their overall capital programme to meet any unforeseen demands or additional costs which might emerge for the capital programme as a whole.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this requirement, the cost for the schools remediation programme is being met to date through a contingency provision as part of the increased 2019 capital budget of &euro;942m and also from the reduced funding requirement for the multi-annual capital development in TU Dublin Grangegorman following the sale of DIT Kevin Street.   This approach does not undermine our commitment to planned school construction projects being delivered over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020 which will provide 70,000 school places and the 29 building projects being progressed at third level.</p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to pursue the original contractor, using all available contractual and legal channels, for the cost of implementing precautionary measures and remediation works in each of the schools.  Two cases are currently before the Commercial Court.  Those are for Ardgillan Community College and Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School. My Department continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the on-going legal process related to the 40 schools built by the contractor.</p></reply>

New apprenticeships being developed in wind turbine maintenance and scaffolding will include best practice in green technology.</p>  <p>  The All of Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption contains actions relevant to education and training in the area of retrofitting and my Department is engaging with partner Departments and agencies to ensure delivery.</p>  <p>  Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) Skills Specifications have been developed by Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board with support from a range of organisations, including third level institutions, construction sector representative bodies, Government Departments and other agencies.   The specifications cover areas such as airtightness and fabric and ventilation for new build and retrofitting of existing buildings.   A dedicated NZEB Training centre is now established in Wexford and is currently providing 10 NZEB training programmes to existing construction workers in areas such as plumbing, electrical, bricklaying, carpentry and plastering.  As of the end of October 2019, 322 people received NZEB training. </p>  <p>  Construction skills are also being targeted through Springboard, further education and training programmes and other initiatives.  A number of current traineeship programmes include components that are relative to eco-friendly/sustainable training topics including traineeships in wind turbine maintenance and interior systems.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Generation Apprenticeship competition 2019-2020, which has been extended to second level schools, has a sustainability theme.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within  a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including the school to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  Patronage of the new school was awarded to Educate Together. The delivery of the interim accommodation for the school to which the Deputy refers on its permanent site is contingent on receiving planning permission from the Local Authority. </p>  <p>  Notification of the initial Decision to Grant was received by my Department on 14th November, however there are another 4 weeks to wait before the final grant of the decision issues.  On confirmation of the Final Grant, accommodation to facilitate both the primary and post-primary schools for the school planning area referred to by the Deputy will be installed on the permanent site.</p>  <p>  Thereafter, a planning application for the permanent school will be submitted.  Until confirmation of planning permission is received and a timeline for the permanent project is agreed it is not possible for the school to increase its enrolment intake beyond the current intake level.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  </p></reply>

Over 1,300 additional posts in schools have been funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  Corresponding statistics from post primary level show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 13.8:1 to 13:1 at post primary level in the same period.    </p>  <p>  Teachers are currently allocated to at an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 26 pupils at primary level, and at a ratio of 19:1 in the Free Education System and 23:1 to schools in the fee-charging sector.  Approximately 300 teaching posts would be required for each 1 point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule, while approximately 1,150 teaching posts would be required for each 1 point adjustment on the post-primary side.</p></reply>

The availability of the options to retire on pension in the case of teachers covers a very wide age spread from age 50 to age 66 (age 70 from 2018). Approximately only 5% of teachers work to their compulsory retirement age, the remainder retire voluntarily where they have the reached the required service or reached the minimum age threshold to do so. That said the  approach adapted by my Department has proved robust and has provided a good indication of the scale of likely retirements and the expenditure implications for the following year.</p>  <p>  The need for supplementary estimates over the period 2014 to 2018 to cover additional pension costs did not arise due to errors in forecasting.</p>  <p>  Prior to Budget 2019, and aside from allocations to cover pay agreements, there had been no significant increase in the expenditure base for pensions for a number of years, despite increased costs.  Given that this expenditure is demand-driven and non-discretionary, it was therefore necessary to seek supplementary estimates to provide for retirements and pension costs over and above what would be supported by the original allocation, having regard to offsetting savings which arose in other expenditure areas.    </p>  <p>  This is an issue which has affected other Votes with significant pension commitments.  </p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have worked closely to resolve this issue in order to better align the expenditure allocation with the expected pensions and retirements bill.  For 2019, the Government allocated an additional &euro;147 million in funding for pensions in the education sector, in addition to &euro;12.5 million to cover the pensions-related costs of the Public Service Stability Agreement. This was calculated on the basis of work undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform using data provided by my Department.</p></reply>

A very small number of schools cannot be connected where local infrastructure does not allow, however my Department keeps those schools under review to provide connectivity as and when infrastructure becomes available. The total spent by any schools operating outside of the DES provided and funded programme is not gathered by the Department.</p>  <p>  All post-primary schools (715 in the 2017-2018 school year) and some 58 special schools are included in the High Speed Broadband programme with un-contended symmetrical connectivity of 100 Mbp/s plus. </p>  <p>  The policy of the Department through the Schools Broadband Access Programme is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and within financial constraints. Up to and including September 2019 my Department has provided some &euro;6.1m for the provision of broadband under the Schools Broadband Programme. Currently investment of some &euro;12m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools.

The Act also provides for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy. </p><p>The National Training Fund levy has increased from 0.7% to 1.0% between 2018 and 2020. These increases were accompanied by a package of reforms to the Fund. This has allowed for a total annual investment to grow by over &euro;190 million in this timeframe. This additionality can be seen in particular in the following areas:</p><p>- The overall Apprenticeship population will have grown by 60% since the end of 2017 to almost 20,000 by the end of 2020.</p><p>- The new ETB Skills to Advance programme will provide upskilling to 8,000 people in the workforce by the end of 2020.</p><p>- The number of participants in Skillnet Ireland programmes will have increased by over 40% since 2017, reaching 69,000 in 2020.</p><p>Since the levy increases were introduced, the NTF has also been deployed to support close-to-labour-market skills programmes in areas of identified skills needs through support for enterprise-focused higher education programmes. The targeted support of these key skill areas from the NTF has facilitated broader investment in higher education from the Department of Education and Skills so that a re-distribution of funding between the NTF and Exchequer in tandem with the levy increases has been implemented on a phased basis. </p><p>The following table shows the additional net allocations to Higher Education and Further Education and Training and Skills Development as result of the NTF levy increase.  Funding for apprenticeship has been assigned to the further education and training and skills category in the table, although some of this funding ultimately flows to higher education institutions. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The additional contributions to the National Training Fund arising from the increases in the employers NTF levy </td>       <td>&euro;47.5m</td>       <td>&euro;69m </td>       <td>&euro;74m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Additional revenue allocated to the higher education sector from levy increase</td>       <td>&euro;28m</td>       <td>&euro;36m</td>       <td>&euro;29m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Additional revenue allocated to the further education and training and skills sector from levy increase</td>       <td>&euro;19.5m</td>       <td>&euro;33m</td>       <td>&euro;45m<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Partial structural remediation was carried out in another school. Structural remediation work for another 6 schools is advancing since October. </p>  <p>  Planned detailed structural investigations were carried out in 17 schools over the summer months also and, based on engineering advice, precautionary measures and other engineering solutions were put in place in parts of 13 of those schools before they reopened after the summer holidays.   </p>  <p>  As well as this, a solution has been devised for Ardgillan Community College.  The design phase for this work is progressing and the project will move to delivery when this is completed.  </p>  <p>  The bulk of the remainder of the Schools Remediation Programme is scheduled to be undertaken on a phased basis over 2020 and 2021 and work is well underway in my Department to underpin this.  Details will continue to be communicated to the schools as my Department&rsquo;s plans develop and progress.  </p>  <p>  About &euro;40m has been spent this year up to the end of quarter 3 2019 on the remediation programme, covering the cost of investigations, precautionary measures, fire safety upgrades and structural repairs.   </p>  <p>  The cost to date is less than was initially estimated and this is largely due to the well-managed way in which the remediation programme has been handled. </p>  <p>  I am unable to provide a further breakdown on this figure at this time to avoid compromising either the legal process underway to recover costs against the contractor involved or the planned public procurement process to carry out the remaining remediation work.  </p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code requires Government Departments to make contingency provision within their overall capital programme to meet any unforeseen demands or additional costs which might emerge for the capital programme as a whole.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this requirement, the cost for the schools remediation programme is being met to date through a contingency provision as part of the increased 2019 capital budget of &euro;942m and also from the reduced funding requirement for the multi-annual capital development in TU Dublin Grangegorman following the sale of DIT Kevin Street. This approach does not undermine our commitment to planned school construction projects being delivered over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020 which will provide 70,000 school places and the 29 building projects being progressed at third level.</p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to pursue the original contractor, using all available contractual and legal channels, for the cost of implementing precautionary measures and remediation works in each of the schools.  Two cases are currently before the Commercial Court.  Those are for Ardgillan Community College and Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School. My Department continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the on-going legal process related to the 40 schools built by the contractor.</p></reply>

I understand that Dundalk IT is currently undertaking a strategic planning consultation process with a view to producing its 2020 &ndash; 2023 strategic plan by year&rsquo;s end.  The Department has not had engagement with the HEI in relation to any specific structural organisation of the type the Deputy refers to and which remains a matter for the institution.</p><p>In terms of national higher education policy, Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to support the creation of technological universities (TUs) as HEIs of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. TUs will have greater links to industry and will have a major impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. They will assist in achieving national strategic objectives such as are set out under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland. Government will continue to prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. </p><p>Under the statutory framework detailed in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more IoTs may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process. Section 29 of the Act provides for the application jointly by two or more applicant institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  Section 38 of the Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. The undertaking of the relevant legislative process remains a discretionary matter for decision by the governing bodies of the HEIs involved. </p><p>In addition to the enactment of the 2018 Act, Government have put in place a number of very important supports enabling the establishment of TUs. </p><p>The TU Research Network (TURN) established by my Department completed a report which was launched on 6 November 2019 entitled &lsquo;<i>Technological Universities</i>: <i>Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity&rsquo; </i>and which details the case and requirements for a state change in higher education reform whereby TUs will assist in the delivery of national strategic objectives for regional socioeconomic development, higher education access, research and skills progression. </p><p>The report makes recommendations for the strategic development of TUs in a structured system-wide approach and identifies the need for investment in integrated multi-campus digital infrastructure, research capacity building and realignment of the policy framework and funding for TUs. </p><p>In response Government announced in Budget 2020 the provision of &euro;90 million over the next three years under a new TU Transformation Fund to support IoT consortia to achieve TU designation and the further advancement of established TUs. This is additional to the &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding invested in TU development to date.</p><p>However, there continues to be diversity within the national higher education landscape. Under the 2019 higher education landscape funding call for restructuring, consolidation and collaborative projects, &euro;2.45 million in Exchequer funding was allocated to non-TU related projects with &euro;1.05 million being allocated to a number of HEIs building and deepening cross-border strategic alliances with higher and further education and training providers in Northern Ireland.  Of this funding element an allocation of &euro;0.55 million was made to Dundalk IT for the work the IoT is undertaking in developing a region of learning in the North Leinster &ndash; South Ulster area.</p></reply>

These gradations allow students just over a threshold margin, to remain in receipt of a grant, albeit at a reduced rate that reflects their relative income vis-&agrave;-vis other applicants.  </p><p>There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements in place.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

My Department has no role either in making or deciding on enrolment applications to schools or keeping waiting lists. In these matters, schools are required to adhere to the requirements of relevant legislation and the policies of my department.</p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide and has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.</p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. </p><p>Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.</p><p>In Wicklow alone there are 62 special classes and 3 Special Schools providing specialist support to children with more complex special educational needs.</p><p>The NCSE has planned a further expansion of special class and school places in Wicklow for next year. </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs.</p></reply>

Ireland submits biannual Action Plans to the relevant Committee of Ministers which is responsible for supervising the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. </p>  <p>  The ex gratia scheme is not the sole vehicle through which compensation for sexual abuse in day schools has been paid out.

On the foot of his determinations, payments are being made to a number of victims of child sexual abuse in day schools. The current position is that sixteen offers of payment have been made and, to date, eight have been accepted. Further payments will be made upon acceptance of the remaining offers.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the Independent Assessor's determinations my Department committed to reviewing the ex gratia scheme, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will understand the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved that require very careful deliberation before proposals can be finalised and brought to Government.</p></reply>

With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Information on school enrolments and Child Benefit data allows the Department to map where children are living or attending school and this information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years.  </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand (and timing of demand) in an area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date information on significant new residential development.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is aligned with the demographic changes in an area.</p>  <p>  The pace of completion of planned housing and occupancy of houses is by its nature less predictable and can vary. Accordingly, while the Department takes into account planned additional residential development, the timing of completion of such development can be subject to change depending on local circumstances.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  From time to time for operational or other reasons the patron of a new school due to open in a certain year may choose to defer the opening.</p>  <p>  Of the 14 new primary schools to be established in 2019, two were deferred by the patron as follows:</p>  <p>  - A new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Swords/North school planning area - the patron of the new school advised that there were no enrolments for September 2019 and that the opening of the school has been deferred to September 2020. The patron indicated significant parental interest in relation to enrolments for 2020.</p>  <p>  - A new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Dunshaughlin school planning area - the patron of the new school advised that there are currently no enrolments for the 2019/20 school year and that the opening of the school has been deferred from September 2019.  The patron body expects enrolments from a new local housing development which has been delayed in the area and they have received significant interest for September 2020 enrolments for the new school.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the patrons of these schools. In addition, in the context of further strengthening the demographic analysis process, the Department intends to have additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out the vision for future interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and builds on what has already been achieved by schools who have benefitted from the additional supports available under the initial DEIS programme introduced in 2005.  </p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan 2017 is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved extensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  A critical aspect of DEIS, from the outset, was the evaluation of the programme. The Educational Research Centre (ERC) and the DES Inspectorate have conducted a series of evaluations on aspects of the DEIS programme and findings of this work are contained in a series of published reports. Evidence from this research demonstrates that the DEIS programme is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  DES Retention Rates of Pupils in Second Level Schools 2011 Entry Cohort shows that improvement in DEIS schools&rsquo; retention rates in recent years has been significantly higher than the overall improvement nationally. </p>  <p>  The vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population. The Plan identifies the target groups that are currently being under-represented in higher education, which includes entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education.</p>  <p>  A Progress Review of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Priorities to 2021 was published in December 2018.  The Progress Review acknowledges a number of significant positive developments and characterises the first phase of implementation of the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 as a period of achievement and investment. For example, it highlighted the significant progress in higher education participation rates among some of the target groups such as the socio-economically disadvantaged groups and students with disabilities.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils in the area seeking school places. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice</p>  <p>  A Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or on the basis of some other criterion, including giving priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school, commonly known as a feeder school.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.</p></reply>

NEPS has increased the time allocation for the psychologist assigned to Danu community special school to a level which is three times that which is normally afforded to a special school of a similar size.  Furthermore, the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school has a background in ASD and additional training in behavioural support.  The purpose of this increased level of support is intended to allow for a response to the initial need for individual casework and for systems level approaches to support the teachers in behaviour management, development and ongoing monitoring, and review of Student Support Plans and facilitating effective transition processes into the school.   This work will take cognisance of and coordinate with support to be provided by the NCSE Support Services and any services available via the HSE. </p>  <p>  In addition to the specific school based service, Danu is a school within the broad NEPS Dublin Region.  It will be offered opportunities to participate in NEPS regional support and development initiatives within the region.</p>  <p>  The NCSE Regional Team will work with the teachers and school with the overall aim of building teacher and school confidence and capacity to work with the children in their care. Training and professional development are a key part of this role.  </p>  <p>  NCSE Advisers will be available to provide professional help support and advice on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, the NCSE will appoint a behavioural practitioner with a specific brief to work with DANU and other schools who are establishing special classes for students with autism.  Arrangements are being made for the appointment of the Behaviour Practitioner and it is expected that the position will be filled in late 2019. A Behavioural practitioner will have a primary qualification in at least one of following areas: teaching, nursing, psychology, social work, social care and a related post graduate qualification in the area of Special Education or Intellectual Disability or other relevant fields. </p>  <p>  My Department does not appoint Behavioural Specialists to schools.  Instead, my Department is building school capacity through the provision of professional support by NEPS and the advisory and professional development programmes offered by the NCSE. Schools are advised to adopt a Continuum of Support which research findings indicate is an effective support model.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) including a new 500 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Kilcock school planning area to be located in Enfield which, it is anticipated, will have the effect of reducing pressure on the existing post-primary school in Kilcock.</p><p>This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population. </p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.

My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to  disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at Educational Welfare Service Child and Family Agency, Floors 2-5, Brunel Building, Heuston South Quarter, Dublin 8 or by phone on 01-7718815. </p><p>In addition, under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 where a board of management make a decision to refuse enrolment, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where the appeal involves an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, the appeal must be made to the local ETB in the first instance.

Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 213 in 2019/2020. </p><p>The NCSE has planned a further expansion of special class and school places in Dublin to meet identified need for next year. </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs. </p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to the NCSE planning for special class provision in particular school areas I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes Meakstown and Charlestown are located in the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area in which there are currently nine primary schools and one post-primary school.</p>  <p>  Using school planning area boundaries within my Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS) allows data within those boundaries, including data for enrolments in schools, child benefit and other relevant data to be added to the mapping information, grouped and analysed.  The GIS records the number of primary and post-primary schools within each planning area, the combined enrolments for all of the schools within each area, including total enrolment and enrolment in each class group, together with child benefit data for the 0-4 age group relevant to the area.</p>  <p>  Each school planning area, including Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin11, encompasses a number of areas, including Charlestown and Meakstown in this case. It is not necessary to have an individual school planning area for Charlestown and Meakstown as comprehensive analysis of school requirements must take account of demand across a wider area.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next 4 years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there may be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future which can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools. </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new school for the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  It is open to an individual school to apply for accommodation under the additional accommodation scheme if the school does not have sufficient capacity to meet school places.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school  or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) including the following new schools to serve the areas referred to by the Deputy:</p><p>- a new 8-classroom primary school established in 2019 to serve the Leixlip school planning area,</p><p>- a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Naas school planning area.</p><p>- a new 500 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Kilcock school planning area to be located in Enfield. </p><p>This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population. </p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs.</p></reply>

Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the current school year.  This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has provided for a budget of more than &euro;11 billion for the Department of Education and Skills in 2020. This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of nearly &euro;2 billion since 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Budget 2020 measure of improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four teachers or less will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  For school planning purposes Johnstown Bridge is located in the Longwood school planning area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new 500 pupil post-primary school for Enfield (Kilcock school planning area) to be established in 2020.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the school planning area where they have sufficient places, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.  The OPPS closed for parental preferences on October 4th for the new post-primary schools to be established in 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Implementation of these pilot programmes was being monitored by the Policing Authority as part of their wider oversight of implementation of the Garda reform programme.  As such, the Policing Authority reported progress on a regular basis, the formal reports of which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p><p>The reform programme progressing under the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan has of course, now been subsumed by <i>&lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;</i>, the four year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing and rollout of the new Operating Model meets a key commitment in that regard. </p><p>As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have warmly welcomed the announcement by the Garda Commissioner of a new Operating Model of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>As I have previously confirmed, I was informed of the Commissioner's decision about the location of the new Divisional and Regional Headquarters on the morning of 25 September, shortly before the official announcement.  </p><p>Neither I nor my officials were previously consulted in relation to the choice of those locations - in accordance with the law, the decision on the location of Garda Divisional and Regional Headquarters is and was solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  This is the case in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, under which the allocation of Garda resources and deployment of Garda personnel are for the Commissioner.As recently as December 2018, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in its report &ldquo;Policing with Local Communities&rdquo; confirmed that it is appropriate that the Commissioner should continue to hold responsibility of this sort. </p><p>I understand that the new model will be implemented on a phased basis throughout 2020 and that the Commissioner and his team are meeting with Joint Policing Committees across Ireland, providing opportunities for detailed engagement at the local level.</p></reply>

To meet the associated increase in  demand for accommodation, my Department has initiated two processes to source additional accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, we have sought expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in providing accommodation and related services to people in the international protection process.  Premises assessed as suitable under this process may be offered a short-term contract (usually one year) which will help to meet demand while the regional tender process is rolled out nationally.</p>  <p>  Secondly, we have run procurement competitions through the Government&rsquo;s procurement portal, Etenders, on a regional basis throughout the country to procure accommodation.  These contracts will be longer term with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. </p>  <p>  It is open to accommodation providers to offer premises both through the expressions of interest process or the tender process. </p>  <p>  Tenders received are evaluated on the most economically advantageous tender method which assesses bids on the quality of service as well as price. The level, expertise and qualifications of staff are assessed as part of this process. </p>  <p>  As the evaluation of offers is currently underway, my Department is not in a position to confirm the location of new centres under consideration at this time.  When the evaluation and commercially sensitive aspects of the process are completed, my officials will engage with local communities and their political representatives.  I can however, advise that there are no current plans to open a centre in the location referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  It is important to state that there are accommodation centres all over the State and the overall experience of the communities in which they are located has been very positive.</p></reply>

I am particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the Community Welfare Service in respect of Rent Supplement and on the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.  That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon report, my Department developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them. The guide is available in all accommodation centres and has been published on the IPAS website (www.ria.gov.ie) in a number of different languages. The guide was published in parallel with information sessions provided  in the accommodation centres, coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau, which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.  The IPAS, its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), Citizens Information and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation. </p>  <p>   I can also say that my Department has, in conjunction with a number of charities and NGOs who were awarded funding for projects, assisted a total of 675 people to transit from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community. This figure relates to the period from the beginning of the year to the end of October. I am confident that the services provided with this funding will prove of great assistance and benefit to all concerned.</p></reply>

Kildare for accommodation and ancillary services for international protection applicants. </p>  <p>  Successful bidders were required to undertake mobilisation works to provide for cooking facilities for residents, a foodhall (where residents can procure ingredients and food items as well as toiletries and household items through a points system) and to provide designated living space for families outside of the bedrooms.  A period of 12 weeks was permitted for the completion of any required mobilisation works prior to the inspection of the premises by staff of the International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department (formerly known as the Reception and Integration Agency). Successful bidders were advised that no contract would enter into effect until the mobilisation works were completed and the premises inspected. </p>  <p>  The provider of premises at the Towers Centre in Clondalkin, Dublin 22 was successful in being placed on the tender framework. The owner of the premises was advised that the 12 week mobilisation period commenced on 11 April 2019, which required all works to be complete by the 4 July 2019.   The contractor has subsequently advised this Department that the same premises were to be entered into the Regional Tender competition for Dublin where a longer contract duration (5 years plus 2 years extension by mutual agreement) is on offer compared to the contract duration under the Newbridge contract (2 years plus 2 years extension by mutual agreement). The contractor has indicated that they will not complete the mobilisation works until the results of their tender for the Dublin Region is known.</p>  <p>  The competition for the Dublin Region is currently under assessment and it is anticipated that the results will be known in January 2020.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the premises continues to operate as an accommodation centre under the terms of an earlier contract.</p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021.

The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  The Director of the DSS is working towards having the Service being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the 2015 Act. A lead-in timeframe is essential to ensure that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place. This will ensure that the DSS will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the situation is being kept under ongoing review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the DSS. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  Work has been ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality on the drafting of necessary amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the codes of practice working groups and submissions received from other bodies.  The intention was to bring forward these amendments by way of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016. However, when D&aacute;il Committee Stage took place on the Bill on 30 January 2019, a number of amendments were agreed which had previously been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, thus giving rise to a procedural matter. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue.  I am now giving consideration to proposing a separate, stand-alone Bill to progress amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.   </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: </p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee, </p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and </p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The possibility of establishing a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.  </p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.</p><p>Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  As the Deputy may be aware, I expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>I can confirm that the grant aid scheme remains open for applications from interested groups in 2019 and that all fully completed applications received before the end of 2019 will be considered.  </p><p>I am pleased to announce that I have recently approved extension of the CCTV grant aid scheme for a further year in 2020.  </p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address  <i>communitycctv@justice.ie.</i></p></reply>

There is close ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies who all work closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.  </p><p>As I have outlined in the Houses previously, the existing multi-agency cooperative arrangements in place to tackle cross-border crime are already quite structured and successful.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2015 the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the <i>Fresh Start </i>agreement, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force which is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK Revenue and Customs.  A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also closely involved.</p><p>The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational actions.  In this format, the senior management level of the two police services provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  </p><p>The Task Force has had some notable success in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime.</p><p>The regrettable absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland means that the work of the Task Force is less visible than it might have been.  It was designed to report to Justice Ministers north and south and it is my hope that the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland will allow the Task Force to reach its full potential. </p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and PSNI. </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that the collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was recently extended with establishment of the first ever AGS-PSNI Joint Investigation Team involving Eurojust. This is a very significant and positive development will further strengthen the already close and positive cooperation between police services on the island of Ireland. </p><p>Finally, I would assure the Deputies that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work in addressing cross-border criminality and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform this critical role. The Northern region continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.</p><p>Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 35% over the past 3 years, with the result that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p></reply>

Nor do escorted day releases necessarily lead to release of a person on parole in the short or medium term.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the Irish Prison Service work on an ongoing basis with offenders with a view to reducing any future risk to society in the event of their release, should that occur. The approaches taken in this jurisdiction are evidence-based and represent best international practice.</p>  <p>  Life sentence prisoners are currently eligible to engage with the Parole Board after they have been in custody for seven years, although in practice and over the past 10 years, the average sentence served by a life sentence prisoner before being released on parole has been more than 19 years.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Parole Act 2019 provides for the establishment of an independent, statutory Parole Board, which will make decisions in relation to parole for all eligible prisoners. There are a number of practical steps required for commencement of the Act and establishment of the Parole Board, for example selection of Board members, the appointment of a Chief Executive and staff, putting in place the funding for the new Board and various other matters including determining where the Board&rsquo;s premises will be.  The Parole Act also establishes a new threshold of 12 years which must be served by life sentence prisoners before they are eligible to be considered for parole.

The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the UNCRPD, which came into force for Ireland in April 2018, is one of sustained and on-going improvement. Work is continuing on the reforms needed in this regard. </p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities. It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD; and the NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, will have an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the Strategy and examining how it can support the implementation and progressive realisation of key obligations under the CRPD.  The National Disability Authority (NDA) will also play a critical part in the implementation of the Convention, and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland is unique in having a statutory Centre for Excellence for Universal Design, which has functions to promote universal design of the built environment, products, services and ICT so that they can be easily accessed, used and understood by everyone regardless of their age, size, ability and disability. Universal design while it applies to the population in general, is particularly important for persons with disabilities and older persons. The Centre advise on standards in this regard and to promote their adoption, and supports a number of advisory committees in working with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) in this regard.  The Centre engages with many stakeholders in relation to age, disability, varying abilities and size, as well as government departments and agencies, professional and educational bodies, designers, planners, architects and others to progress and understanding and adoption of universal design in practice.</p>  <p>   The work of the Centre will be helpful in enabling Ireland to progressing its compliance with the UNCRPD which requires research and development of universally designed goods, services equipment and facilities, which require the minimum possible adaption and the least cost, promoting their availability and use, and promoting universal design in the development of standards and guidelines.  Any further actions in this regard will be considered in the context of a national action plan for continued progressive implementation of the Convention.</p></reply>

The CCPC recently confirmed in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation (01/10/19) that it is a large investigation and that it has examined considerable information and potential lines of enquiry. The CCPC has obtained approximately 1.4 million emails and documents from parties under investigation and held 55 witness summons hearings.</p>  <p>  In relation to personal contract plans (PCP), the CCPC conducted a study of the market and published its report in March 2018.

The CCPC continues to raise awareness and provide information to consumers on this topic, most recently conducting a public awareness campaign in May 2019.

The reduced trade barriers, tariff elimination, simplified customs procedures and more compatible technical requirements all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada.  Although the Agreement includes provisions for a mechanism for the settlement of disputes between investors and the EU or Canada, concerning the interpretation and application of the agreement, the Investment Court System (ICS) is excluded from provisional application.  In order for all the Investment Provisions of CETA to come into force, including the Investment Court System (ICS), the Agreement must be ratified by all EU Member States in accordance with their national procedures. </p>  <p>  On 7th September 2017, the Kingdom of Belgium requested the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding the compatibility of the ICS with EU law.  The Opinion of the CJEU which was issued on 30th April 2019 held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with</p>  <p>  1. the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law,</p>  <p>  2. the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, and</p>  <p>  3. the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter. </p>  <p>  This decision of the Court means that no changes are required to be made to the text of the CETA, and EU Member States can proceed with ratification of CETA, according to the requirements of their national law.  </p>  <p>  To date, 13 Member States have ratified CETA, while Ireland, along with several other Member States, chose to await the outcome of the CJEU opinion prior to considering the commencement of the ratification process at national level. </p>  <p>  In light of the opinion of the CJEU, my Department is progressing the necessary steps for Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of CETA, including consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  In due course, I will submit a Memorandum to Government requesting the Government to authorise the moving of a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution), seeking approval on the terms of the Agreement.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann votes in favour of the Agreement, Ireland will notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union that we have completed our respective internal requirements and procedures concerning the ratification of CETA.  While I cannot provide a precise timeframe for this ratification process, my Department continues to progress the matter as a priority.</p></reply>

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to a more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.</p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. </p>  <p>  A deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working.</p>  <p>  To assist this work, an Interdepartmental Steering Group has been formed with representatives from my Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of An Taoiseach. This Group is providing guidance and feedback to the two staff members of my Department who are leading on this report.</p>  <p>The research will include desk research, an online national employee survey and engagement with key stakeholders, including employer representative bodies and remote working interest groups. As part of the consultation process my Department held a Remote Working Consultation Forum on July 18th   of this year. This was attended by Government Departments, State Agencies, enterprises, and the remote working community. The insights arising from this Forum will be included in the final report which will outline the relevant policy implications of remote working for Ireland. The report is expected to be completed in Q4 of this year and published in early 2020.</p></reply>

The application process is straight forward and involves making an application to the Office, providing details of the applicant, an address for service, the trade mark for which registration is sought, the goods or services for which the trade mark will be used, and paying the statutory fees. Applications can be made online and the Patents Office e-filing system provides ample information to guide applicants through the application process. Once the application has been made, it will be examined by the Office and the applicant will be notified in due course as to the acceptance or otherwise of their application. There are different types of marks and the fees payable are dependent on the range of goods and services which the applicant seeks registration for. Extensive information is available on the Patents Office website at <i>www.patentsoffice.ie</i>or the Office&rsquo;s Information Centre can be contacted at 056-7720111 for further guidance.</p></reply>

My understanding is that the company has placed a number of its employees on protective notice. This has resulted in the temporary laying-off of up to 142 staff. Not all of the firm&rsquo;s workers, however, have been similarly affected.</p>  <p>  I understand that the company&rsquo;s decision followed a dispute between management and staff at the plant, which had resulted in industrial action being taken in recent weeks. The company has stated that its core manufacturing operations have had to be suspended on account of that industrial action.</p>  <p>  Workplace disputes are never welcome news &ndash; for workers, for employers and for the Irish economy as a whole. It is clearly in the interests of both sides that this dispute does not continue. As it stands, the facility is not operating as normal and employees are temporarily out of work. I would therefore urge both parties to engage meaningfully with one another, and through the industrial relations machinery of the State, in an effort to find a solution. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of how significant an employer this company is in the North Dublin area, with 370 people normally working at its facility in Swords. These are valuable jobs &ndash; in a key industry &ndash; which makes it all the more important that this situation be resolved. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is aware of the situation and is in close contact with the company and the Workplace Relations Commission stands ready to support negotiations. I would urge both parties to enter into talks with a view to resolving the situation as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Quarter 3 of 2019 was the busiest Quarter in the last 11 years with 5,072 permit applications being processed so the changes currently being implemented within Employment Permits are resulting in higher outputs and reduced processing times. </p><p>An independent Business Process Review (BPR) is currently being carried out to identify further efficiencies that can be implemented in the short term and as a first step in the development of a new IT processing system during 2020 which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitisation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.775.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900071#WRP00400"><p>In 1993, an Indicative Drugs Target Savings scheme (IDTS) was agreed between the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). The Scheme generated considerable savings in drug costs amounting to &euro;177 million, particularly in the earlier years. However, savings had reduced considerably by 2005.</p>  <p>  The object of the IDTS was to encourage rational drug prescribing practices on the part of GPs and to enhance the information and services available to patients.  In return, GPs would be allowed to access funds for approved practice developments (investment in practice premises, equipment, computerisation etc), research and education, and additional primary care expertise at practice level. The remaining portion of the savings went to the Health Board for broad developments in general practice.</p>  <p>  It was subsequently agreed under the IDTS that GPs with a proven track record of savings could be allowed to draw down a sum equivalent to their anticipated saving over a five/ten year period and to repay this advance by way of their savings.  Various types of agreements, many of them in the  form of mortgages, were signed between GPs and various Health Boards who received advances. The advances were paid out between 2002 and 2004 and were for periods of between 5 and 10 years. </p>  <p>  In 2005, following an independent evaluation of the Scheme, the HSE suspended the IDTS as it was no longer achieving its objective. </p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the suspension of the IDTS, approximately 30 GP practices had been refusing to make their annual repayments.  The HSE entered into a mediation process with the IMO who represented most of the GPs in question. The mediation process resulted in an agreement being reached between the HSE and IMO in March 2014. Most of the GP practices with an outstanding balance opted for the terms of the mediation agreement, of which three practices opted to repay in one lump sum.</p>  <p>  Thirteen GP practices are continuing to repay their outstanding loans in accordance with the terms of the mediation agreed mechanism.  The HSE is continuing to liaise with its legal advisors in relation to a number of GP practices who hold an advance loan and have yet to reach a settlement agreement. This process is on-going and the HSE is committed to reaching a legally enforceable agreement with these remaining GP&rsquo;s in line with the terms agreed during the mediation process.</p></reply>

Numerous projects are under way across the Strategy's six priority action areas to improve the organisation and delivery of dementia care spanning the entire dementia journey, from prevention right through to end of life care for people with dementia. Progress made in implementing the National Dementia Strategy is set out in the Mid-Term Review of the Strategy, published in mid-2018.</p>  <p>  The development of national and local dementia care pathways is being progressed through a number of on-going projects including a diagnostic and post-diagnostic framework project; an acute hospital integrated care pathway project; and a GP-specific dementia diagnostic pathway. </p>  <p>  The Dementia Diagnostic Project will establish a standardised approach to the assessment and diagnosis of dementia across primary, secondary and tertiary services.  A three-tiered approach to diagnostic services is proposed and work is commencing on the development of a diagnostic framework and implementation plan. The Project will link with the post-diagnostic framework in development. The funding awarded in Budget 2020 for the recruitment of an additional ten Dementia Advisers will play a key role within the dementia post-diagnostic pathway.</p>  <p>  Work has begun to develop a national dementia care pathway for acute hospitals, drawing heavily on work undertaken at three demonstrator sites in Cork and Dublin. A national audit of acute hospital dementia care is under way and will provide current data on acute hospital dementia care policy and practice, to inform local pathway development and implementation.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific elements of the Strategy that have been rolled out to date in County Louth, as this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The figures from the latest survey for the period 2015-2016 show that the average household spent &euro;18.48 per week on medical expenses which was 2.2% of the total weekly spend, or &euro;960.96 annually. This figure covers a wide variety of services including GP and dentist visits, hospital visits, physiotherapy and medicines and other medical expenses. The Household Budget Survey gives a combined figure for medical and dental insurance in the same period of &euro;23.66 per week, which was 2.8% of the total weekly spend, or &euro;1,230.32 annually. </p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Authority collects information on the average annual premium paid in the Irish health insurance market, which was &euro;1,214 as of June 2018. This is the gross premium before tax relief on health insurance premiums is applied. The Health Insurance Authority does not collect information on the amount households spend on private health insurance.</p>  <p>  I hope this information is helpful for the Deputy's query.</p></reply>

Following Cabinet consideration, the Memorandum was withdrawn at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:-</p>  <p>  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or</p>  <p>  - transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might be interested to know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has commissioned research into the cost of disability.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.

As you are aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy contain commitments to expanding the role of community pharmacy in managing patient health in the community. </p>  <p>  Work has been done in recent years on wider healthcare roles for pharmacies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s Future Pharmacy report, on the expansion of professional pharmacy practice. It is clear from this and other work that there is potential to increase the range of both private and publicly funded health services delivered through community pharmacy. Important new services, such as influenza vaccination and emergency contraception, have already been introduced. </p>  <p>  To be funded by the taxpayer, new public health services in community pharmacy, as elsewhere, should improve health outcomes and provide value for money and benefits for patients. Any new or transferred services should be based on sound evidence, with matching improvements in governance and administration. </p>  <p>  I have discussed these and other issues with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU). My officials will be engaging with the IPU and the intention is to broaden the discussions to contractual and service arrangements during 2020.</p></reply>

Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2019. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and the NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. </p><p>In 2020, the NTPF will further expand its list of targeted inpatient and daycase procedures to support further significant reductions in wait times as well as increasing funding towards supporting full packages of care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include the surgery or treatment where required.  </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the deputy, the table attached shows the waiting list figures by time band for a first Outpatient appointment with an Endocrinologist at University Hospital Limerick at the end of October.</p><p>  ">Waiting List</p></reply>

Endocrinology and psychological support services are delivered on both sites. </p><p>Given the number of agencies involved in the delivery of care to this group, it was decided to establish a steering committee to develop and enhance governance arrangements across these agencies. Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain, National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead for Mental Health in the HSE, chairs this committee. The overarching aim of the committee is to ensure a seamless and integrated service for those presenting with transgender issues, and ensuring the needs of the patient and their families are placed at the centre of service delivery. </p><p>The Steering Committee have met on two occasions to date &ndash; Thursday July 4th 2019 and Thursday October 16th 2019. The inaugural meeting focused on scoping out the remit of the Steering Committee, developing a Terms of Reference to reflect that responsibility, and developing two workstreams with the following remits: </p><p>1. Develop the draft job description for the Child and Adolescent Consultant Psychiatry post, to be located in CHO 7 but with a defined role in OLHSC. </p><p>2. Work on developing seamless interfaces between the agencies involved in care delivery. </p><p>The work of the Steering Committee remains a work in progress and, to date, a number of potential recommendations have been identified: </p><p>1. Move from the current system of psychological support for those under 18 years old to ensure services are provided and delivered by the Irish Health Services; </p><p>2. Develop operational and governance arrangements between Child and Adult Mental Health services (CAMHS/AMHS), to be formalised with Standard Operating Procedures and Terms of Reference; </p><p>3. Develop local expertise in gender assessment in CAMHS/AMHS nationally in order to support the Hub &amp;amp; Spoke Model outlined in the Model of Care. </p><p>The committee aims to have its final meeting in December 2019, after which it will issue a final report and recommendations. </p><p>In relation to your query about the loss of 109 referrals I have referred this to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>   In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>   During the 2019/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected. It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>   As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>   HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons: </p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection; </p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide a medical card application system that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs. If the HSE is made aware that a person has particular requirements, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the application. This assistance can be availed of through a person's local health office or by calling LoCall 1890 252 919.</p><p>Regarding eligibility for health services in Ireland, this is based primarily on residency and means, in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for full eligibility (a medical card). The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards and concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p><p>Sl&aacute;intecare provides the framework within which a system-wide health reform programme will be advanced, including a phased expansion of eligibility to move towards universal healthcare. To that end, it will be necessary to review the current eligibility framework for all services and consider different options that will enable a phased expansion of universal access to a prescribed range of services. These options will take account of the ability of the health system to meet the increase in demand that would be expected, including the resource requirements needed from a workforce and service delivery perspective, as well as the impact on the effective management of the financial resources of the total health service.</p></reply>

The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The Department will progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019. The Department looks forward to the report of the Committee following from this engagement. In the meantime, engagements with the Office of the Attorney General will continue with a view to progressing the legislative development process. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p></reply>

It records episodes of drug and alcohol treatment during the calendar year. The latest NDTRS data for 2018 show that over 10,274 cases were treated for problem drug use, an increase of 15 per cent on 2017. Thirty nine per cent of cases were new, with 57 per cent previously treated. </p><p>Opioids continue to be the most commonly reported main problem drug at 42 per cent, followed by cannabis and cocaine at 23 and 22 per cent respectively. </p><p>Among new entrants to treatment, cannabis is the most common drug at 38 per cent, followed by cocaine at 31 per cent. Two-thirds of treated cases are provided in outpatient facilities, with 14 per cent in inpatient settings. </p><p>The episodes of treatment captured in the NDTRS for 2018 include a very wide range of interventions and settings from services in the community to specialist residential units. Partnership between the health services and the community and voluntary sectors is key to providing support for people as close to home as possible and at the level of complexity that best responds to their need.  </p><p>The Department of Health works with the HSE to raise awareness of the dangers associated with drugs through the <i>Drugs.ie</i>website. In 2019, the HSE developed and promoted two national campaigns aimed at students and the festival goers, who may not present at traditional addiction services. </p><p>Next year, the HSE will commence a targeted national campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use and recommend steps on how people can reduce the harms. This work will include information about club drugs, festival drug use, newer drugs, as well as cannabis. </p><p>A new educational resource ('Know the Score') on drug and alcohol use is due to be launched shortly for senior cycle students. This was jointly developed by the HSE, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, and Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, as an action in the National Drugs Strategy. </p><p>I believe that the increase in numbers seeking treatment is encouraging from a public health perspective, especially as many also use other drugs. Mixing drugs can impact on recovery and increase the risk of overdose. I firmly believe that addressing the drug problem requires a multi-pronged approach, providing harm-reduction and prevention initiatives in tandem with treatment services.</p></reply>

In particular, establishing a medically supervised injection facility in Dublin city centre would provide healthcare for those who inject drugs and save lives. This would also make our city streets safer for residents, children, tourists and workers. </p><p>I strongly support the appeal by Merchants Quay Ireland to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to overturn the decision by Dublin City Council to refuse planning permission for this critical health care facility in Dublin city.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p><p>As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.</p><p>The year-to-date spend to 30 September 2019 for the NHSS is &euro;748.9m. An additional &euro;13m has been allocated to the Scheme for 2019 in the context of managing system demands during the winter period. This will help to support continued access to long-term residential care under the HSE Winter Plan 2019/20 and to keep the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme at 4 weeks to the end of the year.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the number of cases of TB in Ireland is low.  Most European countries do not give the BCG vaccine routinely to all babies.</p><p>Due to a lack of vaccine from the sole EU supplier, the BCG vaccine has not been available in Ireland since April 2015.  The HSE National Immunisation Office and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) have sought an alternative supply of BCG vaccine that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer has been found.</p><p>I am informed that in 2013, a joint recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee proposed moving from a universal neonatal BCG vaccination programme to a selective BCG vaccination programme targeting high risk groups only.</p><p>Following this recommendation, the Department of Health requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a Health Technology Assessment.  HIQA reported in 2015 noting that selective vaccination is more effective and less costly than universal vaccination. </p><p>Given that both reports predate the discontinuation of vaccine supply, the HSE were requested earlier this year to undertake an updated review of the epidemiology of TB in Ireland, considering the public health impact of having no BCG vaccination since April 2015.  This review will be used to inform an updated recommendation to my Department regarding the future provision of BCG vaccination in Ireland.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>   In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the relevant Minister in respect of these UN Climate Change rules.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the most carbon efficient producers of meat and milk globally and this is well understood in the international marketplace. Given the expected increases in world food demand over the coming decades, Ireland is well positioned to meet this growing demand, while simultaneously, reducing overall absolute emissions. </p>  <p>  The goal must be to develop low-emissions intensity production systems so that agriculture, globally, contributes towards meeting the objective of the Paris Agreement.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan recognises the inherent complexities of agricultural production and, in particular, that food production will always result in some level of emissions. I agree with An Taoiseach that it is important therefore to consider the importance of such food production in the long term trajectory for emission reductions. The Climate Action Plan recognises the importance of balancing the challenge of meeting increasing food demand internationally whilst at the same time contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s climate commitments and identifies that this will need to be addressed at EU and international levels.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to engage with DCCAE and the EPA on this important matter as to how best to approach emissions arising from agriculture while ensuring food and nutrition security is protected. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.1216.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900079#WRX01300"><p>Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and Irish law cases relating to Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Directive  have resulted in changes to forestry licensing procedures.   The main examples are outlined below. </p>  <p>Case C-323/17 People Over Wind and Peter Sweetman v Coillte Teoranta resulted in the following ruling:   &ldquo;Article 6(3) of [the Habitats Directive] must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine whether it is necessary to carry out, subsequently, an appropriate assessment of the implications, for a site concerned, of a plan or project, it is not appropriate, at the screening stage, to take account of the measures intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the plan or project on that site.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Two recent Irish High Court decisions are also related to this ECJ decision, i.e. Eoin Kelly v. An Bord Plean&aacute;la (2019) and Heather Hill Management Company CLG v An Bord Plean&aacute;la (June 2019).   Both cases reinforced that any measure, including &lsquo;best practice measures&rsquo;, designed to avoid or reduce the effects on a Natura site cannot be considered during Stage 1 of the process (i.e. AA screening), but instead, can only be evaluated during the AA itself. </p>  <p>  As a result, my Department does not consider any relevant protective measure set out in the environmental guidelines or standards, or presented in the proposal itself, when undertaking AA screening of an application to ascertain whether there is a possibility of it having a significant impact on a Natura site, alone or in combination with other plans and projects. This means that a project can only be screened out if no possibility of a significant effect can arise, even if no protective measures were applied. </p>  <p>Case C-461/17 Brian Holohan and Others v An Bord Plean&aacute;la   resulted in the following rules relating specifically to the AA process: </p>  <p>  1. Article 6(3) of [the Habitats Directive] must be interpreted as meaning that an &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo; must, on the one hand, catalogue the entirety of habitat types and species for which a site is protected, and, on the other, identify and examine both the implications of the proposed project for the species present on that site, and for which that site has not been listed, and the implications for habitat types and species to be found outside the boundaries of that site, provided that those implications are liable to affect the conservation objectives of the site.</p>  <p>  2. Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent authority is permitted to grant to a plan or project consent which leaves the developer free to determine subsequently certain parameters relating to the construction phase, such as the location of the construction compound and haul routes, only if that authority is certain that the development consent granted establishes conditions that are strict enough to guarantee that those parameters will not adversely affect the integrity of the site.</p>  <p>  3. Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the competent authority rejects the findings in a scientific expert opinion recommending that additional information be obtained, the &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo; must include an explicit and detailed statement of reasons capable of dispelling all reasonable scientific doubt concerning the effects of the work envisaged on the site concerned.</p>  <p>Regarding 1. above, as land use professionals, Registered Foresters are expected to keep abreast of developments impacting on their sector. This includes developments relating to environmental legislation, such as the cited ECJ rulings. To supplement this, a Circular to Registered Foresters (and other stakeholders) has been issued (Circular 08 / 2019, dated 23rd May 2019) to remind relevant parties developing an NIS, to catalogue the qualifying interests and to   "identify and examine both the implications of the proposed project for the species present on that [Natura] site, and for which that site has not been listed, and the implications for habitat types and species to be found outside the boundaries of that site, provided that those implications are liable to affect the conservation objectives of the site."</p>  <p>  Forestry licences issued by my Department allow for operational flexibility, but only within the confines of the licence itself and its constituent safeguards (including guidelines, requirements, standards and (if relevant) scheme terms &amp;amp; conditions). DAFM is satisfied that licences issued establish conditions that are strict enough to ensure a degree of operational flexibility that will not adversely affect the integrity of the Natura site.</p>  <p>  The AA process necessitates the input of various experts, and my Department does not foresee expert input being rejected in relation to any individual file undergoing the process. However, DAFM is aware of this ruling and will comply accordingly, if the described situation arises. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, currently, my Department is developing processes and procedures and investing resources to enable the processing and approval of forestry applications, taking according of the above European and national rulings. This includes the development of Standard Operating Procedures, training for District Inspectors and Registered Foresters, investment in ecological expertise (including the recruitment of two addition ecologists for deployment within the Forestry Inspectorate), and the ongoing development of iFORIS, the GIS platform used by Inspectors to process files.  A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the concerns of stakeholders in relation to the AA process but we have an obligation for complying fully and completely with environmental requirements. My officials are in regular communication with stakeholders and they have been fully apprised of the issues involved and of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to address them.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, for my part, I have commissioned a consultant to review my Department's processes and procedures on forestry applications and approvals similar to an exercise undertaken in Scotland.  I expect to receive this report by the end of November and that it will provide an opportunity to make our processes more effective and efficient going forward.</p></reply>

Payment under the Young Farmers Scheme is made for a maximum of five years and is determined by the date of commencement of agricultural activity of the young farmer.  In the case where a young farmer has already been carrying out an agricultural activity, either individually or as part of a group, this period of agricultural activity is included in the calculation of the five year period.</p>  <p>  In 2018, a review of the Young Farmers Scheme application under the herd number shown identified that the person named had commenced agricultural activity under a separate herd number in 2011 and had been the sole name on this herd number until May 2013.

The EMFF New Fishermen Scheme provides grants to encourage fishermen under the age of 40 to establish themselves in the fishing industry by aiding the acquisition cost of their first fishing vessel.  The Scheme aids up to 25% of the acquisition costs of the vessel or &euro;75,000, whichever is the lesser. Separately, new entrants to the aquaculture sector can avail of an additional 10% support (50% total) compared to the usual 40% support rate for other operators under the Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme, which supports capital investment in aquaculture sites.</p>  <p>  More generally, most fishing vessels in the Irish fleet fall under the definition of Small Scale coastal Fisheries vessels, and can avail of very generous grants of 70% for capital investments on board and 80% for other investments, such as value adding investments ashore, lobster v-notching etc.</p></reply>

These meetings allow my officials to understand the priorities of other Member States and also gauge where Ireland can build relationships to help deliver our priorities at Council.</p>  <p>  While the process of deciding on Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels concludes at the December Council, the preparation for this goes on throughout the year.  Scientific data used to inform the negotiations is collected continuously over a 12 month period.  This data, upon which the Commission bases its proposals, generally becomes available from June onwards and it gives a strong indication of what the proposal might look like.  This data is informed by the work of the Marine Institute, amongst others, who work closely with the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES).</p>  <p>  As part of our Sustainability Impact Assessment, I have launched a public consultation on the Commission's proposals for 2020 and I look forward to the outcome of that process which I intend to lay before the Oireachtas next month.</p>  <p>  I am always conscious of the immediate impacts the decisions taken at the December Fisheries Council have for so many communities around our coast.  This is why I believe the advance preparation should be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible, involving my own Department as well as Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute, all industry representatives and the Environmental Pillar.  I will be meeting with these stakeholders next week to discuss the proposals.  This process is invaluable and helps me identify the key areas of concern.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the December Council doesn't happen in isolation from other fisheries negotiations.  A range of international meetings that effectively decide the quotas for some very important stocks such as mackerel, blue whiting, Atlanto-Scandian herring and albacore tuna also take place at this time of year.  Ireland is an active participant at all of these negotiations and they form part of a broader picture for our fishing opportunities that is sometimes overlooked in the activity leading up to December Council.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the fishing industry is a key priority for this Government.  Ireland is well prepared and I will do my utmost to ensure that the final outcome is one that is good for the industry and the long term sustainability of the stocks.</p></reply>

A budget of &euro;56m was allocated to fund the Scheme opened during the period 2014 to 2020 which was the largest allocation ever to an Organics support scheme.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has more than achieved its targets in terms of new land converted and the maintenance of organic land. The area of land under organic production has expanded dramatically as a direct result of my Department's investment. Latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the target for the RDP was to attract some 16,000 hectares of new land into production and to support 46,000 hectares of converted land. These targets have been more than exceeded</p>  <p>  As a further vote of confidence in the organics sector by this Government, my colleague Minister Doyle established an Organics Strategy Group last year comprising relevant stakeholders and state bodies. Part of the remit of the Strategy Group was to consider the case for a possible re-opening of the Organic Farming Scheme. They recommended that it should be re-opened but on a targeted basis. The areas targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  This recommendation acknowledged that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is a targeted re-opening and that I would fully expect that there will be a new Organics scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process. </p>  <p>  As regards the re-opening, the Scheme remained opened for applications up to the 19 December and a total of 225 applications were received. A total of 58 applications were either withdrawn or were deemed ineligible.  Following the ranking and selection process, one applicant withdrew, 55 were successful and 111 farmers received letters informing them that they had been unsuccessful.  All unsuccessful applicants were given a right of appeal to the Organic Unit of my Department. 34 appeals have been received to date.</p></reply>

This commitment is supported by a key Government objective in the Climate Action Plan (CAP) for Public Buildings to reach a &ldquo;B&rdquo; Building Energy Rating by 2030. To achieve this, my Department is working with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to avail of expertise under the EU Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS). This exercise will inform the design and development of a Framework for implementing a comprehensive public sector building upgrade Programme. It will also entail consultation with key stakeholders on the issues and barriers to be overcome.    Developing the Framework will also need to have regard to issues such as project selection, prioritisation, appropriate governance structures as well as the potential to use Energy Performance Contracting models where appropriate. A key part of this project will also be to assess the scale of investment needed and to recommend the optimal mix of funding options which will inform scheduling of Exchequer funding support. A total of &euro;800 million has been provided under Project Ireland 2040 for public building energy retrofit, along with further funding for school energy retrofits, third level building renovations, and public transport fleet replacement. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.1310.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900080#WRY04600"><p>The passive house standard is a voluntary energy efficiency standard for buildings. The retrofitting of existing dwellings to this new standard is challenging both technically and economically. There are very few examples of large scale passive house retrofit projects internationally. For that reason, it is difficult to place a precise estimate on the likely cost of upgrading all homes in Ireland.   The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as required by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010/31/EU), has introduced new requirements for home renovation which came into force on 1 November 2019. The impact of this regulation is that when buildings are undergoing a renovation of more than 25% of the surface of the building envelope, the entire building will have to be brought up to a higher energy performance standard. The Directive also requires that all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) by 31 December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan has committed to increasing the scale and depth of retrofit activity in order to meet our emissions reduction targets from the Built Environment. This will involve 500,000 homes being upgraded to a BER B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent by 2030. A cost-optimal analysis commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Cost Optimal Residential Report Ireland 2018) estimated the cost to achieve a B2 rating from a starting point of a D/E rating to be in the range of &euro;21,000-&euro;39,000. The cost is higher for homes with lower energy ratings and lower for those with higher ratings. </p>  <p>  To deliver our Climate Action Plan target of 500,000 housing upgrades by 2030, we will develop a new retrofitting delivery model. Our plan will:</p>  <p>  - Group homes in the same area together to drive down cost</p>  <p>  - Start with social homes owned by the local authorities, but will embrace privately owned homes in the wider community</p>  <p>  - Develop smart finance options (e.g. loan guarantee models)</p>  <p>  - Introduce easy pay back models (e.g. through your utility bill)</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided &euro;20m to commence this process, starting with groups of social homes in the Midlands to be upgraded at the same time, and expanding to cover privately owned homes also. </p>  <p>  The selection of the Midlands to start rolling out this plan is ideal because of the structural changes occurring there and the commitment of regional skills fora to provide the skilled workers. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has also allocated &euro;146 million for retrofitting homes and businesses through SEAI administered schemes. This record level of investment is an important step towards realising the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan targets for building retrofits.</p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required. </p><p>My Department recently conducted a public consultation to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks, or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. That consultation was extended twice at the request of operators, resulting in a total nine week period for submissions, and it closed on 30<sup>th</sup>September, 2019. </p><p>As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p><p>Operator submissions are assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria. Operators submitting planned investments are required to sign a declaration that they will enter into a Commitment Agreement with the Department if their plans satisfy the assessment criteria and are accepted by the Department as being concrete and credible. Such declarations form part of the consultation findings.</p><p>The findings of the consultation will ensure that the State Intervention Area is up to date and that it reflects commercial operators&rsquo; plans and the responses from householders and businesses, in advance of a contract being awarded. This is an important element in the State Aid approval process with the European Commission. </p><p>On 15 November the European Commission announced its approval of &euro;2.6billion of public support for the National Broadband Plan under EU State aid rules.</p></reply>

A central commitment under the Plan is Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious target of 70% of electricity demand by 2030 along with a suite of actions to deliver this at least cost.    The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is critical to delivering on the 70% RES-E target and is being designed to achieve its targets within a competitive framework which will put downward pressure on the costs to end consumers. The RESS auctions will ultimately determine the precise mix and cost of renewable projects and technology diversity, including solar and offshore wind, that will occur naturally as the scheme matures. </p>  <p>  Private sector funding through corporate contracting will also be essential for meeting higher levels of ambition to increase renewable energy supply. The Climate Plan commits to a 15% target for the renewable industry to develop projects through subsidy free corporate power purchase agreements by 2030.</p>  <p>  Long term decarbonisation of the electricity sector will require significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s potential in offshore renewables including harnessing the potential to export power generated offshore to other EU Member States. Further reinforcement of the grid (including greater interconnection to allow electricity to flow between Ireland and other countries), and putting systems in place to manage intermittent sources of power through developing a range of storage technologies will be essential. </p>  <p>  While significant investment will be required to meet long term targets in decarbonisation of electricity, rapidly falling costs of renewable energy technologies will reduce the costs to energy consumers. It is intended that the Department will keep under review the costs of electricity from renewable energy sources and that RESS auctions will be informed by up-to-date Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis.</p></reply>

A Taskforce has been established to create a new retrofit delivery vehicle and commenced its work in September. As part of its work, the taskforce is developing novel financing schemes to fill the funding gap and to ensure affordable loan schemes and easy payback options are in place for householders.</p><p>My Department funds the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Financing scheme. The scheme supports innovative financing projects for residential retrofits on a small scale. The Credit Union Development Association has received support from SEAI to run their Pro-energy scheme &ndash; which offers a one stop shop to Credit Union members to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes. The Department is working with the SEAI to identify how a scaling up of this approach and similar approaches could be supported further in 2020. </p><p>My Department will continue to explore further opportunities for engaging with finance providers and ensuring that the necessary funding is in place to enable us to meet our climate and energy targets. </p></reply>

In order to achieve this my Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the development of a new, streamlined consenting regime for offshore renewable energy which will modernise and streamline the marine development management and enforcements systems.

This is vital in supporting a vibrant independent sector, including in the regions.    Section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out the minimum threshold of &euro;40m which RTE must make available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. In 2018, RTE spent &euro;40.1 million, broken down as follows: &euro;38.9 million (Television) and &euro;1.2 million (Radio).

In addition to RTE funding, producers of newly commissioned RT&Eacute; programmes also attracted funding from other sources. Several dramas, animation and various other programme genres received a total of &euro;3.228m in Section 481 funding (tax credit created to incentivise investment in film and TV production). BAI Sound &amp;amp; Vision, which is financed from licence fee monies, provided &euro;4.731m to RT&Eacute; commissioned programmes.

Certain ground is deemed unavailable for competition, such as areas in National Parks and these are areas which are generally not available for application.    There is currently no application for a Prospecting Licence received by my Department for this area.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, any new application received would be subject to screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department in compliance with the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011(SI 477 of 2011). Should a licensee propose to undertake prospecting activities within or near a designated Natura 2000 site, it is a requirement that an Appropriate Assessment Screening Report, which would include an ecological assessment, would be carried out and submitted as part of any application for approval to undertake such works. My Department also consults with the National Parks and Wildlife Service before any such proposed works would be approved. A new public consultation process would be undertaken providing details of the new application.</p>  <p>  Any application for a Mining Licence involves a completely separate process which requires consultation under the Planning and Development legislation and Environmental Impact Assessment legislation.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to leading the way in reducing the excessive use of plastics, particularly single use plastics and to this end has:</p><p>- Obtained agreement that Government departments and bodies will no longer purchase single-use plastic cups, cutlery and straws</p><p>- Strongly supported new EU legislation on Single-use Plastic</p><p>- Commenced a clean oceans initiative to collect, reduce and reuse marine litter and clean up our marine environment (by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine)</p><p>- Commissioned a review to establish the best way to reach a 90% collection target for beverage containers, after which the Minister will announce the necessary actions</p><p>- Introduced a new law to ban microbeads (by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government)</p><p>Further consideration of measures to tackle plastics will be undertaken in the context of developing a new national waste policy which will be published in 2020.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I am maintaining a strong focus on expanding the carrying capacity of our public transport system over the coming years. That is how we can really help address the largest sustainability challenge in the transport sector &ndash; by shifting more journeys from private motoring towards suitable alternatives in public transport and active travel. </p><p>To this end, under the <i>National Development Plan</i>(NDP) &euro;8.6 billion has been earmarked for investment in public and sustainable transport over the next 10 years. Proposed projects include <i>MetroLink</i>,<i>BusConnects</i>and the <i>DART Expansion Programme.</i>This substantial investment will transform our future public transport network and enable more people to choose sustainable options as their preferred mode of transport. </p><p>In the more immediate term, we are also making significant progress.  We are increasing the size of the Public Service Obligation bus fleet and improving service provision. On the Luas network, the first of the extensions to the Luas Green Line fleet has entered service with the remaining 25 extensions entering service on a rolling basis and 8 additional trams have also been ordered as part of the Luas Green Line Capacity Enhancement Project.  In relation to rail, there have been improvements to on and off peak-time services, with the Government recently approving the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars. A 10-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric train units is being established which will massively expand the fleet. </p><p>Collectively these measures will increase public transport capacity to help meet the increased demand across the network as well as playing an important role in reducing transport emissions by providing viable alternatives to private car travel. </p></reply>

The Directive implements an Agreement between the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (Cogeca), the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF) and the Association of National Organization&rsquo;s of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union (Europ&ecirc;che). These organisations represent the employer and employee representative organisations in the fishing sector across the European Union.  As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party. My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU Member State. </p><p>An important aspect of the transposition of the Directive is the requirement for consultation with stakeholders.  On 16 November 2018, my Department published Marine Notice 42 of 2018, which invited stakeholders to contribute their views on Council Directive (EU) 2017/159. The consultation process resulted in the Department receiving seven submissions, which were reviewed and published on the Department&rsquo;s website</p><p>.</p><p>Subsequently, my officials met with representatives of the various fisheries organisations to discuss the transposition of the Directive. The outcome from the Department&rsquo;s consultations with stakeholders made an important contribution to the drafting of the package of Regulations required to ensure the transposition of the Directive.</p><p>This work is at an advanced stage and my officials are currently working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of a package of Regulations in order to ensure the transposition of the Directive.</p></reply>

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 (NDP) the main focus of funding for regional and local roads is on maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvements.  In this context, while 12 improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead, subject to necessary approvals, over the next few years, my Department is not in a position to commit to additional major improvement schemes at this point.  My Department is, however, liaising with Councils with a view to developing a pipeline of projects for possible future development.  </p>  <p>  My Department has provided some funding to Clare County Council in relation to the proposed Limerick Northern Distributor Road, with a view to bringing the project through the route selection stage and allow the local authority the possibility of preserving a route corridor to facilitate the possible development of the road in the long term.  My Department is also facilitating the preparation and consideration of an economic and financial project appraisal of the scheme, including an assessment of the impact on the costs associated with the Limerick Tunnel PPP contract, in line with the requirements of the current Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF). </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific (schemes costing less than &euro;5m) and Strategic Improvement Grants (schemes costing more than &euro;5m) for the widening or realignment of regional and local roads.   However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2020 does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the regional and local road network but it will take time to reach the level required even for the basic maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there continues to be very limited scope for funding new or additional projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  It is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  Regarding Fintra Bridge the Department has committed and remains committed to assisting Donegal County Council in upgrading the R263 regional road.  &euro;150,000 was allocated to this project this year and  &euro;22,264 has been drawn down to the end of October. Further monies will be made available in future years as the project progresses.</p>  <p>I understand that Consultant Engineers have been appointed to develop this project through the route selection and detailed appraisal stages of the design process.  A public consultation was held in May 2019 and the routes have since been refined. Environmental walkover surveys are to commence on the 26 November 2019.  This will provide additional information to inform the route selection process and it is anticipated that an preferred route consultation event will be held in Q1 2020.  It is expected that the project will progress to Part 8 planning process and land purchase during 2020.</p></reply>

In 2018/19, private, for profit provision accounted for 74% (3,397) of all services contracted to provide at least one of the DCYA funded programmes, with community providers accounting for the remaining 26% (1,201).  It is estimated that there were 206,301 children attending ELC and SAC services during 2018/19. Over the entire programme year, nine in every ten enrolled children (185,971) participated in at least one of the DCYA funded programmes (ECCE, CCS (including CCSP and CCSU) or TEC) (181,329 between September 2018 and June 2019). Those who were not eligible for schemes were largely school-age children. </p>  <p>  Informal arrangements for ELC and SAC are also common, including childminders. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' Draft Childminding Action Plan estimates approximately 19,400 childminders, though the figure may be far lower. </p>  <p>  Arriving at an average household figure depends on agreeing a set of assumptions, and therefore should be interpreted with some degree of caution. The OECD&rsquo;s international comparative dataset includes an indicator measuring the net costs paid by parents for full-time, centre-based provision, after any benefits designed to reduce the gross ELC and SAC fees. </p>  <p>  According to the data, families with two children aged 2 and 3, with parents aged 40, who are in full time work, earning the average wage, paid 22% of their net household income on ELC in 2018, down from 25% in 2015. The calculated value is &euro;13,056 in 2018, down from &euro;13,466 in 2015. Budgets 2019 and 2020, which saw a combined extra &euro;130m approximately added to the ELC and SAC budget, are not reflected in this calculation. </p>  <p>  At a national level, Pobal&rsquo;s Annual Sector Profile 2018/ 2019 provides a range of service data. The average weekly fee for full day ELC/SAC is &euro;184.36 before any Government subsidy is deducted. The average weekly fee for part-time ELC/SAC is &euro;109.98, again before any Government subsidy is deducted. As in previous years, average fees are higher in urban areas than in rural areas (&euro;191.33 and &euro;165.76 respectively for full day care per week) and in private services than in community services (&euro;190.74 and &euro;168.12 respectively for full day care per week). The average weekly full day fees in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are 66% higher than the lowest recorded for Leitrim (&euro;148.33). The part-time fees are 60% higher in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown than in Monaghan, where these are the lowest, at &euro;83.19. </p>  <p>  The two year ECCE programme is currently considered to save parents approximately &euro;5000 on their ELC costs. The new National Childcare Scheme being launched on November 20th marks a radical new departure for ELC and SAC in Ireland, creating an infrastructure from which universal and targeted funding can be provided to children and families. There has been a 138% increase in investment in ELC and SAC over the last 5 budgets and First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published in 2018 committed to doubling funding again over the next 10 years. This should see the average household spend reducing significantly.</p></reply>

Of these, 25,893 work directly with children which represents an increase of 2,006 staff or 8% on the previous year. This increase matches the number of children enrolled in childcare which increased by 9% from 186,190 in 2016/2017 to 202,633 in 2017/2018.</p>  <p>  Services are required to operate within regulatory minimum adult-child ratios. While I understand that some providers may be experiencing difficulties in recruiting staff, the figures do not suggest a shortage of suitably qualified staff. However, there may be difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff due to low wages and poor working conditions. I have implemented a number of initiatives to attempt to address these issues.</p>  <p>  In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report (2017/2018), the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7% which while still too high, represents a 3% improvement on the previous year. However, data from previous years suggests that half of those contained in the 24.7% figure have left the sector, with the other half joining other services.</p>  <p>  The basic qualification requirement to work in the sector is a qualification in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications. When this requirement was introduced, unqualified staff who planned to retire in the coming years were given the opportunity to sign a 'grandfather' declaration. These declarations remain valid until September 2021. Those who wished to upskill to meet these minimum regulatory requirements were able to access a Learner Fund which provided financial support.</p>  <p>  A Level 6 qualification is only a requirement for room leaders delivering the ECCE programme. The Pobal 2017/18 survey indicated that 65% of those working in the sector in mid-2018 then had a relevant qualification at Level 6 or above, indicating that there were enough staff qualified at this level to meet requirements. However, I acknowledge the challenge many providers are reporting in retaining staff and recruiting new staff. </p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is now &euro;12.55 (as of May 2019), which represents a 3% increase on last year. As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. Specifically, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum.</p>  <p>  Recent initiatives which may improve the recruitment issues include the drafting of a Workforce Development Plan which will aim to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector over the decade ahead, and the appointment of an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services.</p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers in improving the attractiveness of working in the ELC sector include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p></reply>

The majority of these schemes are targeted at low income families. Other schemes are not specifically targeted at low income families, but may be used by them, such as ECCE, which provides two years of free preschool to all children (some &euro;293m was expended on ECCE in 2018/19; which allowed 108,200 children avail of this scheme).</p>  <p>  In 2018/19, approximately &euro;128m was expended on schemes targeted at children from low income households (CCS, CCSP, CCSR, CCST, CETS, CEC and ASCC). Approximately 52,000 children availed of these targeted programmes. </p>  <p>  The amount spent on childcare has increased by 138% over the last 5 budgets rising from a total budget of &euro;264.5m in 2015 to &euro;628.1m in 2020. Inclusive of subsidies, development and administrative supports, I have secured a 2020 allocation of over &euro;200m for delivery of the new National Childcare Scheme, which will be available to lower income and lower middle income families. I am delighted to say that this new scheme is going live for online applications on November 20th. </p>  <p>  In addition to free ECCE places and subsidised early learning and care and school age child care places, my Department also funds other initiatives each year to increase the number of places in the sector, for example the annual capital grant scheme.

At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and they were permitted to split their ECCE entitlement over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days a week ECCE provision in year one and two days a week in year two. In the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have incorrectly believed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years. </p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and a report was produced by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from preschool to primary school.  </p>  <p>   With regard to the specific case raised by the Deputy, the information received to process the ECCE overage exemption application is incomplete. Officials from my Department have contacted the relevant parties to assist them in completing their application. </p></reply>

To help ensure a strong consultation process, a Stakeholder Group comprising representatives from across the sector has been formed and will work alongside the Steering Group.</p><p>Delivering on a further commitment in <i>First 5, </i>I have also recently appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments.</p><p>In Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order, which I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue.

These include the powers to: </p><p>- Maintain a register of early years services;</p><p>- Place conditions on that registration, refuse to register a service, or remove a service from the register where that service is not operating in accordance with the Regulations;</p><p>- Prosecute a service that has not complied with a condition of registration;</p><p>- Prosecute a person or persons who are operating an unregistered service; and</p><p>- Re-examine the registration status of every service on at least a three-yearly cycle.</p><p>Following the RT&Eacute; Investigates broadcast <i>Behind Closed Doors</i>on 24<sup>th</sup>July 2019, I wrote to the Chairperson of Tusla to ask what additional powers Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate might need in order to address concerns it may have about provision within years services. The Chairperson of Tusla wrote back to me in August, setting out a range of additional powers that might be provided to Tusla, which included: </p><p>- Power to close a service immediately where it has failed to register (rather than having to go to Court to seek a prosecution);</p><p>- The ability to request and acquire parents&rsquo; contact details, in order to inform parents as early as possible regarding ongoing investigation/proceedings;</p><p>- Power to require services to display in a prominent position their registration status, and any conditions attaching to the registration;</p><p>- Power to immediately close a service (already registered) where Tusla has evidence of very serious breach of regulations;</p><p>- A requirement to have a &lsquo;fit person&rsquo; regulation related to the registered provider and person in charge;</p><p>- Provision when a service is to be removed from the register for a process to allow for continuation of the service under interim management where appropriate; and</p><p>- Adding Tusla to the list of services under protected disclosures legislation in order to enable staff working in early years services to make disclosures to Tusla.</p><p>While it may be possible to give effect to some of these powers through Ministerial Order, some will require amendments to primary legislation, and careful consideration is needed of each to ensure that any measures taken are robust and legally sound. I have asked my officials to move as quickly as possible, but I recognise that there are complex legal issues involved which will take time to address. </p></reply>

Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The reason for these changes was to make the State pension system more sustainable as life expectancy increases.  This is essential, as people who are working now and whose PRSI contributions fund State pension payments will need a State pension when the time comes for them to retire.  This demographic change has significant implications for the future costs of the State's pension provision, which are increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every four to five years.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation states that jobseeker's payments may be made until a person reaches pensionable age. The legislation also provides that the definition of "pensionable age" will increase as State pension age increases therefore the duration of jobseeker's payments will naturally adjust in line with increases in State pension age.</p>  <p>  The age at which a person becomes eligible for a State pension is 66 and this will remain pension age until 1 January 2021 when it increases to age 67.  A person who retires before reaching pension age may qualify for social insurance contribution-based jobseekers benefit or the means-tested jobseekers allowance if they satisfy the rules of the schemes.  Jobseekers benefit is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  In the case of a person aged over 65, if they have at least 156 PRSI contribution weeks paid continued payment of jobseeker's benefit will be made even where benefit exhausts, until they reach pension age.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment contract between them and their employer. While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65 year in the context of previous State pension arrangements there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment by one or more years if both parties agree.  The Workplace Relations Commission has produced a code of practice on longer working hours and The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also published guidance material for employees and employers who use fixed-term contracts beyond what was the normal retirement age of 65 years.   People are living longer and healthier lives and many of them want to continue working after 65 and these resources can facilitate them in their choice.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind the person concerned should be advised to contact their Intreo Centre who will be able to clarify exactly what jobseeker's payments will apply in their circumstances.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is not a renewal of the JobPath contracts, but the execution of the extension clauses of the existing contracts.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the JobPath activation service is to help long term unemployed jobseekers to find sustainable full time work. For the purposes of the Department's activation services all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register, aged between 18 and 61 years old inclusive, are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.). Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of system based stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.  </p><p>Between July 2015 and October 2019, some 247,296 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service, Monthly Totals are set out in Table.</p><p>The total number of Jobseekers above has been listed by the duration of time spent on the Live Register, at the time of referral, in Table 2.  The tables are available at the following link.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies matter for the Deputy.</p><p>  ">Table 1</p></reply>

The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one-third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate, which was then paid at &euro;186 per week; the current weekly rate of SWA is &euro;201.  I am advised that the diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 February 2014 on the basis of this evidence. </p>  <p>  Existing recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.

I understand that Offaly County Council has recently adopted its annual budget for 2020.</p>  <p>  While local authorities should operate within a reasonably balanced revenue position, it is clear that from time to time there will be factors that will lead to surpluses or deficits arising in annual operations.</p>  <p>My Department works closely with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector as a whole and individual local authorities can meet existing and emerging challenges.

In addition, both new and second-hand dwellings can be used to deliver social housing support under my Department's long term leasing programmes.</p><p>The RLS is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental purposes. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the relevant local authority or an AHB. As part of the agreement, the property owner then leases the dwelling to the local authority for use as social housing for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but subject to a minimum of 5 years. The value of the repairs is offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. </p><p>Further funding is provided to local authorities to acquire a range of properties for social housing use. The properties involved can range from those in good condition to those that need remediation and may have been vacant. To ensure a local-led response to such work, responsibility for property acquisitions is delegated to local authorities. To further assist local authorities pursuing vacant properties, funding is available through the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme to facilitate local authorities in acquiring and remediating vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. As with standard acquisitions, local authorities have delegated responsibility to utilise the Buy and Renew Scheme, as part of the blend of property acquisitions, as appropriate to their area, given housing need and the availability of properties of different types. </p><p>Under the long term leasing programme, a local authority or AHB leases a dwelling from a private owner under a long-term lease for between 10 and 25 years. The dwelling is then sub-let to a social housing tenant.  The local authority, or AHB, is the landlord to the social housing tenant and carries out all landlord obligations. </p><p>The RLS, Buy and Renew and long term leasing schemes are available in all local authorities, in both rural and urban areas. However, it is a condition of entry into all 3 schemes that the property is in an area with a social housing need and fulfils social housing demand.  </p><p>Since the launch of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, in the region of 553 vacant homes have been re-introduced to the liveable housing stock, primarily through the Repair and Leasing, and Buy and Renew initiatives. Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties. These recovered properties aid in the ongoing effort to meeting our commitments under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a range of measures to assist in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s housing needs by ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby.</p><p>My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels. Many of the techniques required to achieve NZEB, such as improved fabric and renewables, have been introduced on a gradual basis into Part L of the Building Regulations since 2007.  </p><p>These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional effort required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.</p><p>A modelling and cost<b></b>study was carried out by an external cost economic consultant for the (RIA) for NZEB. The range of increase in costs was 0.7% to 4.2% over current construction costs depending on the dwelling types and design specification applied. The average uplift in cost across all dwelling types modelled was 1.9%.  Based on this study, typical uplift in cost for a typical semi-detached dwelling will be in the range of 1,483 euro to 3,822 euro depending on the specification of the heating and ventilation system installed.</p></reply>

This means that there is no designated competent authority, which has the power to approve or restrict access to the profession in Ireland under national or EU law. </p>  <p>  In early 2016, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) published Awards Standards for Architectural Technology award. The Awards Standards are designed to be used by: </p>  <p>  (i) providers when designing new programmes and establishing minimum intended programme learning outcomes; </p>  <p>  (ii) awarding bodies when validating new programmes;  and</p>  <p>  (iii) in the accreditation of programmes by the relevant professional bodies. They are also used by providers when reviewing their programmes.</p>  <p>  In general, the regulation of professions is in the first instance a matter for industry representatives working in consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.  My Department has been engaging with the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) in relation to the establishment of a statutory register. In this regard, CIAT has identified that its preferred route is to set up a stand alone register for Architectural Technologists. As such, it is now a matter for CIAT to set up a register on an administrative basis in keeping with registers already in place for other professional groupings under the Building Control Act 2007 and in consultation with the relevant industry stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  When this process is complete, my Department will be in a position to review it and potentially bring forward legislative proposals to amend the Building Control Act 2007, to provide for a statutory register of Architectural Technologists. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-19a.1743.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111900088#WRGG01850"><p>My Department works closely with the local government sector through the City and County Management Association (CCMA) in the preparation of a consistent and evidence based approach to the various funding challenges facing the sector. This work has helped inform the decision making process to ensure that a coherent and sector wide view of the particular issues are presented. Of course, all such issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national and fiscal budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at the wider Governmental level. </p>  <p>On its establishment, Irish Water was initially subject to commercial rates for 2014.  In November 2014, the Government announced a new package of measures related to the financing of Irish Water.  As part of these measures, section 12 of Water Services Act 2014 provided that Irish Water would not be rateable for the purposes of the Valuation Act 2001.  This decision to exempt Irish Water from commercial rates was made to ensure that households and businesses paying water charges at the time would not have to meet this cost.  Local authorities were compensated for this loss of revenue through the Local Government Fund. It was always the case that this compensation measure would only remain in place for as long as Irish Water was exempt from commercial rates. </p>  <p>  In July 2017 the CCMA submitted a report concerning rates on water infrastructure and the financial impact of the Irish Water rates exemption to my Department.  Among other things, it recommended that the exemption for Irish water from rates in the Water Services Act 2014 be reversed and that Irish Water be valued as a global utility undertaking in a similar manner to other national utility networks.  </p>  <p>  A new funding model for water services was developed in 2017 following on from the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017.  The Water Services Act 2017 was enacted on 17 November 2017 and implemented key features of this new funding model.  Section 61 of the Act contained a provision to remove the Irish Water exemption from commercial rates.  This was consistent with the general approach applicable to the infrastructure of public utilities.</p>  <p>  On 20 February 2019 the Minister for Justice and Equality made the Valuation Act 2001 (Global Valuation) (Irish Water) Order 2019 (S.I. No. 60 of 2019) which provided for the Commissioner of Valuation to carry out a valuation of relevant properties occupied by Irish Water.  The Order provided that the global valuation be made by reference to 31 March 2018 and entered in the Central Valuation List by 18 October 2019.  Further to this Order, the independent Commissioner for Valuation issued his preliminary national valuation on 18 July 2019.   Section 61 of the Water Services Act 2017 was commenced with effect 18 October 2019, when the valuation was then entered on the Central Valuation List.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year the CCMA submitted a further report on this subject to my Department, which highlighted the local government sector's concerns in respect of the rating of water and waste water infrastructure and the distribution of the Irish water valuation and considered the financial impact on local authorities.  Most recently, following the issue of the preliminary valuation certificate for Irish Water in July 2019, the CCMA submitted a report concerning rates income impacts and Irish Water.  </p>  <p>  In all engagement and communication on the rating of Irish Water and the cessation of compensation in lieu of rates from Irish Water, my Department indicated that it was actively monitoring the financial impact of this transition on individual local authorities in the context of their overall financial position. This is an ongoing process and engagement takes place on a bilateral basis between officials in my Department and individual local authorities. My Department has been in regular discussions with the nominated local authority representatives regarding the potential implications of the valuation of Irish Water from March 2019. These discussions took place during the Reval 2019 process and the development and passage of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Bill, and had a particular focus on the financial implications for local authorities. I am satisfied that there was sustained and robust engagement with the local government sector on this matter.</p></reply>

Planning authorities are now specifically empowered to take in charge part of an estate, or some but not all of the facilities in an estate.</p>  <p>  The initiation of procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended) does not preclude a planning authority from pursuing a developer for costs incurred by the authority in respect of works undertaken on an estate, to enable it to be taken in charge by that authority.</p></reply>

Every local authority receives a minimum amount of LPT funding for its own use; this is known as the baseline.  Local authorities with surplus LPT income i.e. income above the baseline, retain a portion of that surplus, up to 20% of the projected LPT yield for that area, also for their own use. Any remaining LPT above that is used to &quot;self-fund&quot; certain Housing and Roads services in their area. Local authorities that require &quot;equalisation&quot; funding are not required to self-fund. </p><p>Irrespective of baselines, each local authority retains 80% of the estimated LPT  yield to be collected in its own area.  The remaining 20% is used to support &quot;equalisation&quot; funding for those authorities with lower property bases.  Exchequer funding is also required to ensure every local authority receives at least its baseline funding. Two-thirds of authorities receive &quot;equalisation&quot; funding support to bring their funding levels up to their baselines. </p><p>In 2019, overall LPT allocations to local authorities amount to &euro;503m. In 2020, I expect that LPT allocations will increase to &euro;516.8m. The increase is largely accounted for by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020.  When a local authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%), it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in the local authority area. Likewise, when the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the income that would have been otherwise collected. The 19 local authorities that voted to increase LPT above the basic rate are expected to increase LPT income by &euro;19.7m, for their own use, in 2020. </p><p>Detailed information on LPT, broken down by local authority, including the allocations to each local authority in 2019 and 2020, are available at the following link on my Department's website:</p></reply>

To ensure impartiality, transparency and fairness, adjudicators are independently appointed and they undertake their functions in an autonomous capacity. </p>  <p>  Section 123(3) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 states that any of the parties concerned may appeal to the High Court, within the relevant time period, a determination of a Tribunal on a point of law. </p>  <p>  The RTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes. However, section 182 of the Act provides that if the damages sought in a dispute amount to more than &euro;20,000 or, in the case of rent arrears more than &euro;60,000, the dispute may be referred directly to the Courts. </p>  <p>  Prior to 2004, where there was a dispute between a landlord and a tenant, there was no alternative but to go to Court for dispute resolution services. This was costly and time consuming for the parties involved, with the majority of cases taking years to resolve. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to change the right of appeal under section 123 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, in order to target SSF funding interventions, in October 2018, local authorities were invited to undertake an economic assessment of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was necessary and economically viable.  As part of that assessment local authorities were also asked to consider the broader housing affordability within their area.  19 local authorities returned economic assessments, this included Kilkenny County Council, who carried out assessments on two of its sites around which it was indicated affordability issues existed.</p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  Of these 35 approved projects, one is located in Kilkenny City and was identified in the Council&rsquo;s economic assessment.  This site at Crokers Hill has received approval in principle for SSF funding of almost &euro;2m for infrastructure that will support the delivery of 26 affordable homes.  The overall cost and the timing of delivery for this project is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement of the project in the first instance, and Kilkenny County Council and my Department are working to achieve delivery from this and other sites as quickly as possible. </p><p>I anticipate that a further call for proposals under the SSF will issue to local authorities in 2020. </p><p>Homes delivered under the SSF are subject to the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which was commenced in June 2018.  This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  I can confirm that Kilkenny County Council submitted their Scheme of Priority to my Department on 24<sup></sup>April 2019 which I subsequently approved on 29<sup></sup>April 2019.</p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p><p>In addition to SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is also designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand. 30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance.  These projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities and approximately 7,800 of these homes will be offered at a discount on open market prices.  Kilkenny received approval for two projects; one in Western Environs and one in Ferrybank with a combined LIHAF funding of over &euro;9m to deliver a total of 730 homes by 2021.  Infrastructure works commenced on 4<sup>th</sup>March 2019 in Western Environs and in Ferrybank on 1 October 2019. The Western Environs LIHAF site is expected to deliver 60 social housing units on the local authority site along with the delivery of 423 cost reduced homes on the private site, with planning for housing on this site due to be submitted shortly.</p><p>These schemes will complement other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported over 15,000 households nationally.</p><p>Details of affordable delivery by local authority and year are available at my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The URDF has an allocation of &euro;2 billion in the NDP to 2027. </p>  <p>  In July 2018 bids for URDF funding support were invited from public bodies, and as a result a total of 189 applications were received by my Department.</p>  <p>  The application process was competitive and in the event, the call was oversubscribed in terms of potential value of proposals compared to the available annual URDF provisions.  In this context all proposals went through a rigorous assessment including consideration by a Project Advisory Board (PAB), which consisted of representatives from my Department, other relevant Government Departments, agency representation and independent national and international expert representatives. </p>  <p>  Following this process, on 26 November 2018, I announced initial URDF support of &euro;100m for a total of 88 projects throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  All applicants both successful and unsuccessful received a detailed breakdown of the assessment of their proposal.  Where the decision in respect of a proposal was unfavourable, applicants were offered the opportunity to request a review of the Departments decision.</p>  <p>  As a result, requests for a review were submitted in respect of seven proposals.  Each of the proposals involved was reviewed, having regard to the PAB's original evaluation and scoring of the proposal against the URDF programme criteria. </p>  <p>  In all cases, including the cases of the Northern Cross Route, Drogheda and Bridge Street, Dundalk , it was found there was nothing to support an outcome that would be materially different from that arrived at through the PAB process.</p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the URDF will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  In the context of the second call it will be a matter for Louth County Council to consider the projects it may wish to submit for consideration and whether, having regard to their previous assessments, the Council could consider submitting further proposals in respect of these areas.</p></reply>

I understand that the advice of the Council executive to the Council members at the meeting was that an exhaustive process had been undertaken over the last number of years and the delivery model proposed was considered the most effective way to develop the site both in terms of mixed tenure and from a financial perspective.</p>  <p>  This agreement will seethe development of 768 homes.  This will include a tenure mix which is structured to ensure community sustainability and comprising 50% private housing (411 homes), 30% (192 homes) social housing with the final 20% (165 homes) set to become affordable housing.  This is in line with the tenure mix previously agreed between the Council and my Department.  This approach was also agreed by the previous Council in 2017.</p>  <p>  I am aware that on 4 November a group of Councillors including representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour, the Social Democrats and the Green Party, acting under the name of the 'Dublin Agreement Group', announced that an &ldquo;agreement has been secured&rdquo; to purchase of 30% of the total units available at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens from the developer. However, as I understand it, this agreement has no legal basis, and presumably relies upon any purchaser paying the full open market price for these units. </p>  <p>  A number of weeks previously, I made myself available to meet with a delegation of Councillors in relation to O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, but this offer was not taken up.  No information has been provided to me in relation to how it was envisaged such an approach would work in practice. More importantly the Councillors in question did not confirm from where the very significant capital funding required had been secured. My Department did not receive any request for funding in connection with this announcement. While I am pleased that this important project has received the formal approval by Councillors that will allow it to proceed to the next phase. I have written to the Lord Mayor on this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked consistently with the Council in support of efforts to advance its proposals for this site.  It is anticipated that my Department will fund, in full, the development of the 247 social homes on the site. My Department is also funding another 56 social homes, which are currently under construction, as part of an associated development. </p>  <p>  Separately, subject to the conditions of the scheme, approval in principle had already been confirmed for Serviced Sites Funding from the Department to support the delivery of the more affordable homes on this site.  This grant funding is associated with the 165 more affordable homes for purchase that will be delivered on site at significantly below open market rates.  These 1, 2 and 3 bedroomed homes will be made available to purchasers at an average price of &euro;300,000 and in no circumstances will they cost more than &euro;310,000.</p></reply>

The Panel recommended supporting six demonstration projects under measure 4(d) relating to group sewerage schemes. </p>  <p>  The six demonstration projects selected consisted of two in Leitrim and one each in Clare, Kerry, Monaghan and Wexford. It was envisaged that the demonstration projects would be completed over the course of the programme. I understand that for various planning and organisational reasons outside the control of my Department and the local authorities none of these demonstrations were completed.  </p>  <p>  As a result, the Expert Panel were unable to evaluate them.  However, the Panel recommended a further six community wastewater connection schemes as demonstration projects for the 2019-2021 funding cycle. I accepted the Panel's recommendations when announcing approvals and funding allocations for the current programme in October. The demonstration projects approved under the 2016-2018 multi-annual programme will continue to be eligible for funding to proceed to completion under the 2019-2021 cycle. </p>  <p>  Under the programme grants for these demonstration projects of up to 75% of cost are available subject to a maximum grant of &euro;6,750 per house (this means that the effective cost limit per house for the project is &euro;9,000). A supplementary grant in excess of these limits is only considered in exceptional circumstances where full justification is provided. </p>  <p>  All of the demonstration projects consist of extensions to the existing public collection network in their areas - they do not involve any waste water treatment facilities. </p></reply>

The relief is given at 32% of the lowest of eligible expenditure or 80% of the total cost of production of the film or &euro;70,000,000.  In addition, as part of the growth strategy for the sector, a new provision, the Regional Film Development Uplift was provided for in Finance Act 2018 and now offers an additional tax credit (in addition to the standard 32% tax credit) to be made available to productions being substantially undertaken in &ldquo;assisted regions&rdquo;. This will contribute to the strategic aims of building an industry in less economically advantaged areas.  Independent producers of content can apply for Section 481 tax relief.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to Screen Ireland the development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry, supports the development and production of original Irish drama, comedy, documentary and children&rsquo;s animation for the independent production sector in Ireland. Recent years have seen increased Government support for the Irish audiovisual industry with the launch last year of the Audiovisual Action Plan that incorporates an amount of &euro;200m for investment in audiovisual industry through Screen Ireland. In this year&rsquo;s budget, I was pleased to secure an additional &euro;1 million in funding for Screen Ireland for 2020, bringing its total allocation for the next year to &euro;20.040m.</p>  <p>  Screen Ireland supports writers, directors and production companies across the sector by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.</p>  <p>  Television drama production is an area of particular focus for Screen Ireland and in 2019, it launched the TV Drama Production funding scheme which is aimed at driving the expansion of the indigenous TV drama production sector and provide opportunities for Irish talent to develop both creatively and professionally. New projects emerging from this fund include Normal People, The South Westerlies In addition, under this scheme, in conjunction with RT&Eacute;, Screen Ireland funded the production of 4 television sitcom pilots, a scheme to support new Irish comedy. All four pilot episodes aired on RT&Eacute; this Autumn and one will be selected to go to full series. Through Screen Skills Ireland, the agency supports and develops the skillset for the independent production sector through training initiatives to enhance the creative, technical and business skills for television creatives and crew. This includes a structured Multi-Camera Drama Directors Training scheme, in partnership with RT&Eacute;, which took place in early 2019 as well as regular training courses for all areas of television production including: television production research, writing and structuring television drama and developing ideas for factual and entertainment programming. </p></reply>

The development of that Plan is led by my Department.</p><p>Our heritage belongs to us all and it is important this shared ownership is reflected in Heritage Ireland 2030 &ndash; not only in its content but also in its composition. My Department issued a Public Consultation Document in November 2018 in which members of the public and stakeholder organisations were invited to respond to questions relating to the  proposed themes of the plan. To inform the process, my Department, alongside partner organisations and Local Authorities organised approximately 70 public workshops to encourage individuals and communities to make submissions.  Workshops were organised by the local authority Heritage Officers at various locations throughout the Country, including 20 events north of Galway across counties Mayo, Roscommon, Donegal, Sligo and Monaghan.  </p><p>The Heritage Council held three consultations, two in Kilkenny, where they are based, and one in Claregalway. These included two regional events, one covering the South East and the other the West and Mid West and a national sectoral event. A Report on Heritage Ireland 2030 Public and Sectoral Meetings, which gives details of these events and the findings is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>A public information session was held in Dublin Castle last May to present the findings of the public consultation to 280 attendees. Consultations on drafting the report are continuing and I hope to be in a position to publish Heritage Ireland 2030 next Spring. A detailed analysis of the submissions received through the public consultation is available on my Department's website at  .</p></reply>

In advance of any turf cutting taking place in this area, consent would also be required from the relevant public authority and consultation would have to take place with the landowner and turbary right holders, if any.</p>  <p>  I am advised that my Department is continuing to try to resolve outstanding access matters.

As I have previously advised the House in my response to D&aacute;il Question No. 22 of 6 November last, my Department and several of the bodies under its remit, have undertaken a number of initiatives in support of the objectives of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, 2017 &ndash; 2021.</p><p>On 18 July last, I launched the permanent National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, celebrating living cultural heritage practices in Ireland. This initiative represents official State recognition of cultural practices all around Ireland, two of which are Traveller Tinsmithing and Cant/Gammon, the traditional language spoken by Irish Travellers.</p><p>The development of the National Inventory of Ireland&rsquo;s Intangible Cultural Heritage is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s work under the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which requires signatory States to recognise, protect and promote the living cultural heritage of their countries.</p><p>Funding provided to Local Authorities under the Creative Ireland Programme in 2018 also supported  the undertaking by the Waterford Traveller Community Development Project of Neegas Whidden: &lsquo;Telling our own Stories&rsquo;.  This project focused on capturing the stories of the elder members of the Travelling community by recording older members of the community and presenting their reminiscences as podcasts online and as audio supports at events. Older Travellers are mostly invisible in Irish society. This initiative made sure that the life experiences of older Travellers were recorded and valued for future generations of Travellers and the general population to enjoy.</p><p>Examples of other initiatives promoting Traveller Culture awareness by bodies under the aegis of my Department include:</p><p>The development and realisation of the Travellers' Journey Exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland - Country Life in County Mayo in 2018.  The exhibition, which ran for a year, was opened in July 2018 by President Michael D. Higgins and included a series of events and talks on aspects of Traveller Culture and Identity. Projects arising from the Travellers&rsquo; Journey Exhibition include: </p><p>- CAMP. An art project led by artist Aideen Barry in which she and her students from Limerick School of Art and Design worked with members of the Traveller community in the west of Ireland to produce a series of visual art pieces. The resultant art pieces will be installed as part of this exhibition. This project ran from November 2018 &ndash; February 2019 in the Museum of Country Life. </p><p>- A talk entitled &lsquo;I am Traveller: Our Histories and Heritage&rsquo; chaired by Senator Collette Kelleher held in February 2019 for which Traveller groups from Cork, Donegal, Meath, Mayo and Dublin formed the panel and shared their insights on traditional and contemporary Traveller culture and interesting community initiatives. </p><p>- The launch in April 2019 of the Travellers Journey Children&rsquo;s Book. This was a partnership project between the National Museum, Kids&rsquo; Own Publishing, Involve, and Scoil Iosa, Ballina and funded by the National Museum, Department of Justice and Equality and Mayo North East under SICAP and PEIL.</p><p>The hosting by the Crawford Art Gallery in partnership with Cork Traveller Women&rsquo;s Network &amp;amp; Cork Visibility Group of a number of events in the Gallery as part of Cork Traveller Pride 2019 Festival; </p><p><b>- Talking with Travellers: </b>Workshop for people interested in knowing more about the journey, history, culture and real lived experience of Irish Travellers.</p><p><b>- Looped Film Screenings: </b>Traveller Oral history film &ldquo;Would you like to Suni at the Vardo&rdquo; by Cork Traveller Women&rsquo;s Network and UCC Folklore Dept. Film &ldquo;Beady Pocket&rdquo; is based on a poem by Traveller writer Rosaleen McDonagh, film by Mahon Traveller women with Frameworks Films. </p><p><b>- Craft Workshops</b>:Workshops on the traditional Traveller craft of paper flower making. </p><p>In common with a number of other Departments and Agencies my Department is represented on the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering (NTRIS) Group which is chaired by Minister of State David Stanton T.D. and hosted by the Department of Justice and Equality.I am advised that officials from my Department, at Assistant Principal and Higher Executive Officer level have attended seven meetings of this group in 2018 and to date in 2019.  Further details of the work of this group would be available to the Deputy from the Department of Justice and Equality that provides the secretariat to the group.</p></reply>

Tourism is also strong in the region, particularly cultural tourism. </p>  <p>  Substantial investment has been provided in recent years in support of the Sliabh Liag Strategic Development Project by Donegal County Council, F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and the Interreg Programme, with support from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>  In addition, I approved a language plan for the region in April of this year in accordance with the provisions of the Gaeltacht Act 2012. This region is recognised as Limist&eacute;ar Plean&aacute;la Teanga (LPT) Dh&uacute;n na nGall Theas and the plan's implementation is being managed by L&aacute;r Chomhairle Par&oacute;iste Ghleann Cholm Cille Teo with ongoing financial support provided by my Department via &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  Finally, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have informed me that they envisage further  opportunities for development and job creation in the tourism sector in the area.
