Telemental health is widely used within other militaries and its efficacy is supported by research as an effective and useful addition to more traditional supports. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Working Group is addressing the implementation of a Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy. The timeline provides for the final completion and implementation of this strategy in July 2020. Telemental health and psychosocial support form part of this process and are being considered accordingly. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that members of the Defence Forces serving overseas already have access to the DF Personnel Support Service (PSS). The PSS provides a welfare, information, psychosocial support and referral service, that is professional, responsive and confidential. It sustains and enhances the individual well being of personnel, and promotes a safe and positive work culture, in order to support the effectiveness of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Mental health supports are part of a range of medical and non-medical services provided to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them. Other medical mental health services available to personnel include access to clinical psychology and psychiatry services. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds a confidential counselling, referral and support service for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence volunteers. The service provides confidential counselling on a wide range of personal and work related issues, including but not limited to health, relationships, addictions, financial, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</p>  <p>  In the case of relationship counselling, the spouse or partner may also attend the counselling sessions. A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24/7 basis 365 days a year. The helpline provides for referral to appointment-based telephone or face-to-face counselling. </p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the available medical services offer comprehensive supports to members of the Defence Forces, I can assure the Deputy that they are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

In accepting the report the Government also approved a plan, <i>Strengthening Our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase 1</i>,<i></i>to implement the recommendations in the report.</p><p>A review of technical pay was provided for in the Public Service Agreement 2010 - 2014 (Croke Park Agreement). The purpose of the review in the context of the agreement was to rationalise existing technical pay arrangements and consider if the requirements could be met in a more cost effective manner. </p><p>A review of Technical Pay Group 1 was conducted in 2014 and came into effect on 12 January 2015. Military Management completed an initial review of Technical Pay Groups 2 - 6, which was presented to the Department in March 2017. Further work on this Report was required. </p><p>The Public Service Pay Commission recommended that the review of Technical Pay Groups 2 - 6, be completed at the earliest opportunity, without compromising the Public Service Stability Agreement. The Commission recommended that the review would include consideration of the earlier military management proposals.</p><p>The primary focus of the recommendations in the report of the Pay Commission relating to technical pay was substantially different to the focus of the original review. The altered focus of the review has resulted in a requirement for a slight extension to completing the project to allow for further analysis. While every effort has been made to carry out the review within the timeframes set out in the high level implementation plan, this extension to the deadline is warranted to ensure that the review is as comprehensive as possible. </p><p>An initial report focusing on three priority areas has been completed and is under consideration. Work on further aspects of the review is ongoing, as provided for in the plan.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a development path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper. </p>  <p>  The White Paper sets out a blueprint for the development of the RDF and that the primary role is to support the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in crisis situations. In non-crisis situations the main focus will be in training for this role. The White Paper states that the types of tasks that the RDF could be required to undertake in crisis situations is varied.</p>  <p>  The principal legislation underpinning deployment of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is the Defence Act 1954. This legislation provides for, among other things, the call out of members of the RDF on permanent service during periods of emergency and the call out of members of the RDF in Aid to the Civil Power. The White Paper on Defence provides for a review of this legislation to identify proposals for any changes in the Defence Acts that may be required in order to reflect the possible crisis situations, where activation of members of the RDF is appropriate. This work has not commenced as yet as other tasks have been prioritised.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the PDF. In this context, there may be individual members of the RDF, who by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications or in the case of members of the FLR, professional military skills, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks. These could include ICT, medical, ordnance and engineering professionals. The White Paper provides for the establishment of a panel of such individuals to be established, to be known as the Specialist Reserve. </p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a Specialist Reserve. A Skills survey of the RDF was conducted in 2015/16. The survey highlighted the existence of a substantial body of skills and qualifications in areas such as science, computing, engineering and medicine which have a direct relevance to the Defence Forces.  A gap analysis of skills sets in the PDF will identify potential roles for those Reserve members who possess specialist skills and this is linked to an ongoing Workforce Planning project. </p>  <p>  The ultimate intention is to utilise those Reservists who have specialist skills for which gaps exist in the PDF, and whose personal circumstances allow them to do so, to undertake required tasks in the Defence Forces, including on overseas missions. Options to underpin the engagement of such Reservists will be identified as the various stages of this work unfold.</p></reply>

I have been advised that a formal submission will be made to my officials shortly.</p><p>My Department remains open to discussions with the Department of Education and Skills in relation to the future planning provision for schools in that area, having due regard for current and future operational military requirements arising in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-17a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121700056#WRA01800"><p>The Irish Aviation Authority has statutory responsibility under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 for the regulation of Civilian Aviation in Ireland. This includes remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) or, as they are more commonly known, Drones. In Ireland, no drones are permitted to fly within 5km of an airport.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps monitors developments in drones and Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) on an on-going basis. While the regulation of drone/RPAS in civil airspace is a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority, the Irish Air Corps is aware of their growing numbers and capabilities.  The Defence Forces are aware that non-military drones/RPAS have flown near or over Defence Forces installations without approval, which is of concern from both a flight safety and a security perspective.  </p>  <p>  The threat faced from drones is primarily one of safety when they are not operated correctly. Drone Operators need to educate themselves and they need to fully understand they are in operation of an unmanned aircraft and that they understand the rules of flying and the restrictions and prohibitions.  Where drone operators do not observe the rules in force, this places other air operators and the general public in danger. The Irish Aviation Authority take user education and training seriously and has developed a suite of guidance material tailored to both a recreational and professional audience.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also note that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport chairs the National Civil Aviation Security Committee. The Defence Organisation, including members of the Air Corps, participate on the National Civil Aviation Threat and Risk Group which is part of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee and they actively contribute to discussions on how the State can keep abreast of, and respond to, the threats and risks associated with increased drone activity in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is also of note that drones do not just present a threat but also an opportunity. Both the Defence Forces and Civil Defence have deployed their drones in assistance of the relevant Lead Government Agencies with regard to assisting in search and rescue operations and in security operations. This support will continue and the utility of drones is open ended as the technology develops. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces deliver military training programmes and modules meeting national, EU and international standards. They also engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate continued and ongoing organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces maintains up to date knowledge and competence with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods in the execution of its various roles as assigned by Government.</p>  <p>  The General Officer Commanding and Director of Military Aviation has assured me that training is ongoing and he is satisfied that there is a robust programme in place to ensure members of the Air Corps are prepared for and can respond to hazards.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the commitment sought applies to NATO Allies only.  The commitment sought does not apply to partner nations such as Ireland and therefore is not under consideration.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with NATO is through our participation in Partnership for Peace, which is a voluntary flexible instrument for cooperation between NATO and its partner countries. This involvement has delivered significant improvements for our Defence Forces in terms of capability development and operational capacity and has enabled us to make a positive impact, particularly in undertaking more demanding international crisis management operations.  Ireland views its contribution to such operations, whether through UN, EU, NATO or OSCE led operations, as contributing to the overall European security architecture and, more widely, to international peace and security, which is a key focus of our foreign policy.   </p>  <p>  Interoperability with partners is central to the efficiency and effectiveness of our involvement in peace support deployments and, more importantly, the protection of our troops when deployed depends on interoperability with partners deployed alongside us. Participation in Partnership for Peace assists us in achieving this objective but with financial obligations remaining a national prerogative.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that the health and safety of personnel in the Defence Forces remains a priority for myself and the Chief of Staff. </p>  <p>  The Working Time Directive has been transposed into national legislation by way of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. As the Deputy will be aware, the Defence Forces are excluded from the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. The Government has committed to amending this Act and bringing the Defence Forces and An G&aacute;rda S&iacute;ochana within the scope of its provisions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is the lead Department for this legislative process and the Department of Defence is working closely with that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on the provisions for the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The Working Time Directive recognises the unique nature of certain military activities and allows for exemptions of such activities in certain circumstances. The Directive also provides for derogations for specific activities. The Defence Forces have undertaken a comprehensive examination of work practices and have identified where derogations or exemptions may be required. As the Deputy will appreciate, the issues being considered are complex and there is a requirement to ensure that health and safety of personnel is protected whilst the Defence Forces retain operational effectiveness.  This has informed work on the required legislative changes.</p>  <p>  A subcommittee of Conciliation and Arbitration Council (comprising of the Representative Associations, military and civil management) has been established to discuss matters relating to implementation of the Working Time Directive.

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU Procurement Directives, including the Defence and Security Directive. </p>  <p>  Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions. </p>  <p>  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all bidders that are entitled to enter procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria. </p>  <p>  With regard to engagement at EU level regarding policy governing the purchase, sale or tendering for defensive equipment from countries that may violate international law or human rights, these matters remain the responsibility of my colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. </p>  <p>  The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargos. I am satisfied that this is an appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect.  In the absence of a general trade embargo, the Department of Defence cannot unilaterally preclude companies from participating in tender competitions for military equipment or any other type of goods.</p></reply>

Through the co-funded European Defence Fund, Member States will be able to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own, by pooling national resources.  The Fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The Fund will have two strands or windows, which are complementary - the Research Window and the Capability Window. </p>  <p>  From 2018 to 2020, the EU Commission has allocated &euro;590 million from within existing resources to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP), which is a precursor programme to the EDF.  In terms of objectives, the EDIDP and the EDF are broadly similar.  </p>  <p>  The EDF, which will only come into effect post-2020, will be financed under the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The current level of funding proposed is in the region of &euro;6 billion - which will come from the EU Budget - but this will depend on the outcome of negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework.  These are currently underway and the proposed funding is subject to further revision.  There has been no expenditure to date on the EDF.  No funding will flow through the EDF until 2021.  </p>  <p>  The EDF is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for CSDP.  In that regard, it is similar to other EU industry and research support programmes, such as ICT, biotech, space etc, funded from the MFF.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and innovation to ensure that Irish interests, particularly in the area of opportunities for SMEs are strongly represented in the work programmes under these funding sources.</p></reply>

It provides the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s expanding development cooperation programme, outlining Ireland&rsquo;s vision of a more equal, peaceful and sustainable world. Ireland's policy on international security and defence operates in a complimentary manner to this. Peacekeeping and conflict resolution form two elements of Ireland's engagement in the international peace and security sphere alongside political engagement, development cooperation and humanitarian action.</p>  <p>  Preventing crises, resolving conflict, arresting climate change, protecting vulnerable populations and saving lives in humanitarian emergencies are in Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interest.  Ireland's policy for international development also highlights that conflict and fragility, compounded by climate change, are increasing the vulnerability of millions. Globally, the number of major violent conflicts has tripled since 2010 and more countries are experiencing war than at any time in nearly 30 years.</p>  <p>  The commitments made by Ireland under Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) do not impinge on or conflict with the goals and ambitions outlined in our policy on international development.  </p>  <p>  Then EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as part of the Common Foreign Security Policy, provides the basis whereby the EU contributes to international peace and security and regional stability in the face of increasing conflict.  PESCO is a capability development mechanism provided for under the EU treaties to deliver capabilities in support of CSDP missions and operations. It represents a further development in EU cooperation in support of international peace and security.  PESCO enables member States, including Ireland, to further develop their capabilities in support of peacekeeping through participation in joint projects with like-minded partners. It also has the potential to help reduce the cost of developing and procuring necessary capabilities.</p>  <p>  As a committed EU Member State, Ireland supports fully the efforts of EU Member States to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the prevailing challenging security environment, including in the area of defence. Within the framework of CSDP, Ireland has supported the development of recent EU defence initiatives with a view to enhancing the EU&rsquo;s capacity to engage in peace support and crisis management operations, particularly in support of the UN and to delivering the necessary capabilities, both civil and military to this end.</p></reply>

Defence Forces personnel continue to occupy three posts in the Operational Headquarters of the Operation Sophia mission in Rome.   </p>  <p>  The EU Naval Mission, Operation Sophia, is primarily a security operation, designed to disrupt the traffickers business model and counter oil and weapons smuggling.  Operation Sophia has played an important role in improving the overall maritime security in the Central Mediterranean. </p>  <p>  A decision was adopted by the European Council on 26th September 2019 to extend the mandate of Operation Sophia for a further 6 months until 31st March 2020, with a temporary suspension of its naval assets, while Member States continue working on a solution related to the disembarkation of any rescued migrants.  As the suspension of naval assets under Operation Sophia remains in place, and there is no agreement on the locations for the disembarkation of any rescued migrants, there are no plans for the return of Naval Service vessels to the Mediterranean at this time. The Operation mandate continues to be implemented through strengthening surveillance by air assets, as well as reinforcing training support to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that although the deployment of EU Naval assets to Operation Sophia has been suspended, EU Member States have highlighted the importance of continuing to work closely with the relevant authorities and international organisations to improve the protection of refugees and migrants.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces Personnel overseas.  The changing nature of demands and potential future mission profiles need to be considered in the context of assets and capabilities which can be made available by the Defence Forces for overseas deployment, given existing operational demands at home and overseas.</p></reply>

The current structures optimise the capacity of the Defence Forces to continue to fulfil the roles assigned to it by Government, and as such, there are no plans to reconsider the barracks infrastructure.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, and as outlined in the White Paper Update which I published last week, there have been very important modernisation projects completed in the last few years and many are ongoing, all contributing to capability. However, the Government acknowledges that there is continuing potential for additional investment in military facilities and, with this in mind, a focused five year infrastructure programme will be launched in January 2020. This will provide the means to channel available funds to where these will have the strongest impact.</p></reply>

Work on this project is advancing well and is expected to be completed in Q2 2020. </p>  <p>   A competitive tendering process is also underway for the provision of a new Cadet School Headquarters Building in the Curragh at a cost of &euro;2m. This project involves the construction of a new building to provide office and ancillary accommodation for the management, lecturer and support staff.</p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputies that my Department, together with the military authorities, are actively developing a 5 year Built Infrastructural Plan. I am advised that this Plan, which will address infrastructural requirements for all our military installations, is now at a very advanced stage of development and will be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

A comprehensive implementation plan entitled &quot;Strengthening our Defence Forces Phase One &quot; was also published by Government.  </p><p>The PSPC report recommended a range of measures that would result in immediate and future benefits for members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF). The immediate measures included:<blockquote><ul type="disc"><li>a 10% increase in military service allowance</li><li>the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances</li><li>the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties</li><li>the restoration of a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots</li></ul></blockquote>These measures have now been implemented following their acceptance by the representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA. These measures which will cost &euro;10 million per annum are in addition to increases in pay which members of the Permanent Defence Force are receiving under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. The most recent of these was a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from 1st September 2019.<br /><br />The Government's plan also provides for further measures in the short, medium and longer term. The plan sets out timelines to deliver on the PSPC recommendations.  This work is, under my direction, being prioritised by civil and military management. This includes a review of pay structures in the PDF, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the identification of pay related retention measures. Both of which will be progressed within the framework of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. A range of other pay and non-pay related actions are also being progressed. <br /><br />Of the 10 projects being led by my Department, civil and military, 9 are up and running and are broadly on track. <br /><br />These projects include a review of technical pay, which will affect enlisted personnel who are specialists.  This review is well advanced with an initial priority focus on technical specialists in the Air Corps, Naval Service and CIS Corps.  The initial draft report is currently being considered and a further draft report on the second phase of this review is nearing completion. <br /><br />Options for incentivising longer service for certain NCO and officer ranks, in particular those with specialist skills undergoing a significant loss of experience are being developed and this will feed into future pay negotiations.<br /><br />There are also a range of non-pay projects, on which work is underway or due to commence shortly.  These include a review of recruitment methods, enhanced workforce planning, enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF, the development of further non-pay retention measures and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas.<br /><br />I am confident that all the measures contained in the plan, coupled with pay benefits being delivered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 will address recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force. <br /><br />However, it should be noted that as the Government's plan contains short, medium and long term measures, the full impact of these measures will take time to determine. There are also a range of external variables which impact on recruitment and retention and which can change. <br /><br />The capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake the tasks assigned by Government will continue to be carefully monitored having regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission and other actions which are underway.</p></reply>

Legal advice was sought on how best to progress certain disclosures as elements related to matters which are the subject of the ongoing litigation. I appointed an independent reviewer to examine the disclosures.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of the report of the independent reviewer, I invited the views of those who had made the disclosures and published the report.  I also sent the report to the Chief of Staff for the views and actions of the military authorities to be set out.  In parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps had continued to work with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) to improve its health and safety regime. I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances.  Subject to completion of the improvement plan the HSA investigation is closed. However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are continuing to develop their approach to the management of health screening.  In relation to health surveillance, a risk assessment process will identify that exposure to a hazardous substance can cause a disease or illness and if there is a reasonable likelihood of an illness occurring.  Specifically, in relation to carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic for reproduction (CMRs) the Chemical Risk Assessment will identify the need for specific health surveillance or screening.  The Defence Forces have a comprehensive annual occupational medical screening process.  Unit commanders will ensure that Defence Forces medical staff will be informed of the type and nature of activities carried out by individuals.  Individuals are also responsible for briefing the medical staff on the type of activities they carry out in their work practices during the medical screening process.</p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency is currently managing a number of claims for personal injuries alleging exposure to chemical and toxic substances while working in the Air Corps. There is ongoing engagement with the State Claims Agency in this context and my consideration of these issues must necessarily be informed by this ongoing litigation. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this point.</p></reply>

I have made it clear to my Department and the Defence Forces that the protections of the Act must be afforded to those who make qualifying disclosures under the Act.  I take very seriously any complaint of penalisation or threatened penalisation of a member of the Defence Forces for having made a protected disclosure and I note that a statutory mechanism for investigation is available to the complainant.  The mechanism is the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces as provided for in Section 20 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.</p><p>I am not aware of any officer who made a Protected Disclosure who subsequently left the Defence Forces applying to re-join, nor am I aware of any enlisted person who made a Protected Disclosure and subsequently left the Defence Forces seeking to re-enlist as a recruit.</p><p>Given, as I have already outlined, that the Protected Disclosures were made by a variety of individuals both retired and serving and also anonymously it is not possible to clearly identify the number of personnel who made Protected Disclosures who are still serving.</p></reply>

The establishment of PESCO in December 2017 represented a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  </p>  <p>  Through participation in all aspects of CSDP, Ireland has been able to influence the overall direction of CSDP, in particular ensuring recognition by the EU of the UN as its key strategic partner and ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism.  Participation in PESCO is important in continuing that influence.  </p>  <p>  PESCO provides a framework for capability development designed to contribute to enhanced capabilities for CSDP crisis management operations in the medium to long term so as the EU has greater capacity to act in support of international peace and security.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is currently participating in two PESCO projects - (1) The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance, and is an observer on a further nine projects. </p>  <p>  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO, Ireland, together with fellow participating Member States, have made several commitments which include regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, increased cooperation on cyber defence and the use of the European Defence Agency as the forum for joint capability development, among other commitments. As a participating Member State, the PESCO commitments inform our defence planning in the short, medium and long term. Ireland also completes an annual PESCO National Implementation Plan which is shared with other participating Member States in order to track progress on  these commitments. </p>  <p>  In relation to engagement with European defence manufacturers, the principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to ensure fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement Directives, including the Defence and Security Directive. Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions.  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Ireland's overall participation in PESCO and the specific PESCO projects in which we are engaged, my Department has not been subject to lobbying by European arms manufacturers.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, to ensure our Defence Forces have the best equipment required to undertake the roles assigned by Government, including on difficult and dangerous overseas operations, it is important that officials and members of the Defence Forces remain abreast of the latest developments in defensive and military equipment through engagement with industry representatives and manufacturers.  My Department would also engage in market sensing and attend international conventions on military equipment in this regard.  In the normal course, manufacturers would also meet with officials and members of the Defence Forces to make presentations on new and emerging technologies and equipment.  This is part and parcel of the business of my Department.</p></reply>

As mentioned, we are also a member of the International Contact Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief which is an informal cross-regional network which aims to encourage information sharing and cooperation between governments to discuss joint advocacy strategies.</p>  <p>  Ireland also works within an EU context to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. The EU's policy in this area is led by the Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which were adopted during our Presidency in 2013. The EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy includes a commitment to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief.</p></reply>

This followed months of protest.  I commend the African Union for its robust leadership and facilitation of the agreement, with Ethiopia playing an important part in mediating the talks.   </p>  <p>  As an expression of its strong political support for the changes underway in Sudan the EU signed the 17 August agreement as a witness.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to support a civilian-led transition in Sudan.   </p>  <p>  Assuring Sudan's long-term stability will require the inclusion of all elements of society, notably women and youth, in the transition process.  In this regard, I welcome the appointment of four women Ministers in Sudan&rsquo;s new Government, including its first ever female Foreign Minister, and the appointment of a woman as chief of the judiciary. I also welcome the establishment of an investigation into the violent crackdown against protesters in Khartoum on 3 June &ndash; it is imperative that this investigation is independent and transparent, in order to ensure that the perpetrators are held accountable.   </p>  <p>  While recent events give cause for optimism, significant challenges remain.  Some are political: Sudan&rsquo;s military signed the power sharing agreement only under intense external pressure.  The leaders of long running insurgencies in Darfur, Blue Nile State and South Kordofan rejected the 17 August agreement, with peace talks between the Government of Sudan and rebel leaders ongoing.   </p>  <p>  Sudan&rsquo;s current economic outlook is of pressing concern. Basic commodities are in short supply, with queues for basic food items and fuel, and severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country.   </p>  <p>  Significant support, including from Ireland and the EU, is required in order to assist Sudan in its transition and to ensure that the humanitarian situation arising from economic and other challenges are addressed.  Prime Minister Hamdok attended the November Foreign Affairs Council.  EU Foreign Ministers, including the T&aacute;naiste, reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s strong political commitment to supporting his civilian transitional Government, as well as the EU&rsquo;s readiness to provide financial aid for the transition. The EU supports wider efforts to enable Sudan's transitional Government to secure debt relief, access to finance and foreign investment, as part of that country's transformation process.</p>  <p>  This month&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on Sudan which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to accompanying Sudan as it implements the necessary political, economic and social reforms path required to make the transition to democracy a success. Building democratic institutions, ensuring respect for the rule of law, and strengthening democratic actors is an integral part of achieving peace and economic recovery.   </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided almost &euro;30 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through UN, NGO and Red Cross partners.  This year, over &euro;3.6 million in Irish funding was provided, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable.  Through Irish Aid&rsquo;s rapid response mechanism, an experienced Irish nutrition advisor was deployed to work with UNICEF in Khartoum coordinating the nutrition response across the country.  In response to the violence surrounding the transition, Ireland gave targeted support to the Sudan Humanitarian Fund to help address the medical needs of those affected.   </p>  <p>  Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Sudan Humanitarian Fund, which has allocated $55.7 million so far in 2019 to support the complex and ongoing crisis in Sudan.  Through this mechanism, our contribution is pooled with other donors, facilitating a single, unearmarked fund which can support the highest priority projects put forward by the best placed partner on the ground.  This year, the number of people in need targeted through this fund increased from 5.5 million to 7.8 million.  The fund supported humanitarian responses in the areas of health, shelter, child protection, gender based violence and psychosocial support, nutrition, water, sanitation and education.   </p>  <p>  My officials continue to actively monitor political developments and the humanitarian situation in Sudan, including through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Nairobi, in cooperation with the EU Delegation in Khartoum, and through Ireland&rsquo;s strategic engagement with the OCHA donor support group and as co-chair of the ICRC donor group.</p></reply>

A decision was taken in the 2005 budget to exempt applicants aged 65 and over from the passport fee.

I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;75 for an application made via Passport Online, which breaks down to &euro;7.50 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;10 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;13 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.50 per year for an Australian passport.</p>  <p>  Based on the volume of passports issued in 2018, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of eliminating the passport application fee for applicants aged 65 and over to be approximately &euro;5.5m.

Action was taken in 2016 to address concerns about the use of section 110 and fund vehicles by foreign investors to take profits derived from Irish real estate without paying Irish tax. This resulted in the introduction of the IREF (Irish Real Estate Fund) framework in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments are being made to the taxation of REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies in Finance Bill 2019. A number of anti-avoidance measures are being introduced to the IREF regime to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property by preventing the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits and preventing the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. In addition, the IREF return filing requirement is being placed on a mandatory annual footing and the information which Revenue can request has been increased to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the sector. </p>  <p>  Several amendments are being made to the taxation of REITs in the Finance Bill 2019 to ensure the regime operates as intended.  The obligation to deduct REIT Dividend Withholding Tax has been extended to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals and new measures have been introduced to require the proceeds of property disposals to be re-invested in property assets or distributed within a set period. The deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status have been restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. </p>  <p>  Section 110 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose companies set up to securitise assets. A number of amendments are being made to the section 110 regime in the Finance Bill 2019 to strengthen the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also place the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which will enable Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation. </p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 Finance Act process I committed to produce a report on REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. This report was prepared by my officials and presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July.  </p>  <p>  The importance of institutional investment in the supply of both commercial and residential property must be recognised. Rebuilding Ireland identified the encouragement of the build-to-rent sector as a key factor in improving the rental sector and acknowledged that institutional investors have the potential to provide significant investment in such projects. Increasing the supply of urban apartments is essential if we are to reach our National Planning Framework targets and reduce price pressures for tenants. </p>  <p>  However, where such investment brings profit, a fair share of tax must be paid.  Therefore, as I stated in my Budget speech, scrutiny of activities in this sector will continue and further corrective action will be taken if necessary. </p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary. The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p><p>As the level of future investment in the film industry, and therefore future claims to the tax credit, cannot be quantified, the potential saving from a withdrawal of the scheme could only be estimated by reference to the historical cost of film credit. </p><p>The annual cost of the film tax credit can be found under the &lsquo;Investment in Films&rsquo; heading in the Costs of Tax Expenditures table published at link: . This shows a cost for 2016 of c.&euro;75 million and a cost to date for 2017 of c.&euro;23 million.  Due to the manner in which film credit is claimed, the tax costs are provisional and continue to increase over two years. The table, and the figures for 2016 and 2017, will be updated accordingly over time.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that a cost benefit analysis of the film tax credit was conducted by my Department in 2018, and is available online in the following report: .  This analysis examined the economic cost and benefits of the scheme for the year 2016, while taking into account standard estimates of the shadow price of labour, the shadow price of public funds, and grant deadweight - subject to data availability. The total result of the cost-benefit analysis was a net economic cost to society of &euro;72 million in 2016, before consideration of the cultural dividend and other unquantifiable benefits. The average net economic cost for 2015 and 2016 was &euro;56.2 million.  However, it is important to note that data constraints and the unquantifiable nature of the cultural return to society make it difficult to capture the entirety of economic benefits associated with this relief. </p><p>A number of significant changes were made to the credit as part of the 2018 Finance Bill process. In recognition of the nature of the production cycle and the long lead in times needed for productions to be undertaken, the credit was extended from its original end date of 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024.  In conjunction with this extension, and in order to ensure a robust administration process and oversight of claims, the credit was moved to a self-assessment system, in line with other similar reliefs.  The application process has also been divided between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to provide an opportunity for earlier engagement on the training requirements associated with the credit, including the quality of training to be provided. The Finance Bill 2018 also provided for a new short-term, tapered regional uplift, commencing at 5%, for certain productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis over 5 years.</p></reply>

No. 174 of 2019), earlier this year, the NCID has been established in the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that yesterday, 16 December 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland published the first National Claims Information Database Report on Private Motor Insurance, which includes aggregate data from the NCID.  The aggregate nature of the data collected has meant that there are fewer legal and technical complexities involved, and that is why it has been possible to have the NCID established and reporting so quickly.  </p>  <p>  Both Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I commend the work of the Central Bank in bringing this Report to fruition.  We believe it is an excellent report, which provides an objective overview of private motor claims costs including legal costs over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  I would hope that going forward the increased transparency brought about by the NCID, along with other legislative changes, can help to provide more stability in the market, thus avoiding the peaks and troughs for consumers in terms of premium pricing.  This should ultimately make the Irish market more attractive to new entrants and I would hope that this might be one of the outcomes of this exercise in time.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Report shows that the insurance and legal sectors have both serious questions to answer regarding the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with the price of motor insurance.</p>  <p>  It appears that insurers under-priced in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses incurred and consequently are now making significant profits.  At the same time, the legal costs associated with the litigation settlement channel seem disproportionate when one considers that the report indicates that the award levels for those settlements under &euro;100,000 are not much higher than equivalent settlements in PIAB.  In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.  </p>  <p>  While it is true to say that the nature or severity of the injury claims settled in the different channels can vary significantly and there may be good reasons for pursuing litigation, I believe that this report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost-effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.  This is a key aim of the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  </p>  <p>  The NCID Report also demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.  In this regard, the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.  This is not sustainable in my view.  This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.  I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines.</p>  <p>  With regard to employer and public liability insurance claims related information being incorporated into the NCID, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank has the power to expand the scope of the NCID to other classes of non-life insurance under the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.  The Deputy will recall that our focus was on ensuring that the NCID was able to collect private motor insurance first and it was for that reason that the CIWG recommended that the Central Bank first undertake a study on the merits and feasibility of expanding the scope of the NCID to employer and public liability insurance claims (recommendation 2).  The Central Bank is finalising its consideration of the merits and feasibility of collecting this data and the CIWG expects to receive the Central Bank&rsquo;s final view on this shortly in line with the timeframe for the recommendation.   A decision will be made at that stage as to whether the database will be expanded to cover employer and public liability insurance.</p></reply>

Farmers who elect to register for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT on costs incurred in relation to the farm business; if they remain unregistered they are entitled to apply a flat-rate addition to their supplies to VAT registered businesses to compensate them for the VAT borne on input costs by such farmers.  </p>  <p>  Currently, the flat-rate addition applied by unregistered farmers to their supplies to VAT registered businesses is 5.4%, which is the rate calculated to compensate farmers at the aggregate level for the VAT borne by them in the course of their farming activities. This rate applies to all qualifying farmers across all agricultural sectors, including farmers involved in intensive farming such as farming activities described as feedlots. The VAT registered business treats the flat-rate amount as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return, claiming input credit for the flat-rate amount paid to the flat-rate farmer. </p>  <p>  The flat-rate addition is reviewed each year and adjusted where necessary to ensure that farmers who are not registered for VAT are compensated at the aggregate level for the unrecoverable VAT borne on their input costs. </p>  <p>  The operation of the flat-rate addition scheme in respect of feedlots has been the subject of previous questions but unless there are structures and contractual arrangements in place to enable the industry to engineer a systematic excess of flat rate addition payments over VAT costs no VAT policy issue arises. I have the power to exclude an agricultural sector from the flat-rate scheme where I am satisfied that, because of the business structures, contractual arrangements or models in place, the application of the flat-rate addition within that sector has resulted in, and would otherwise continue to result in, a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs incurred by flat-rate farmers in that sector. I am currently considering such a report from Revenue in respect of the poultry sector. If the Deputy has information about similar structures in any other sector he should refer it to Revenue.</p></reply>

This estimate assumes no behavioural change on the part of the companies. </p>  <p>  The types of deductions that the Deputy is referring to would include deductions for capital allowances and trading losses. The provision of capital allowances for capital expenditure is a standard feature of both corporation tax and income tax systems.  It recognises the cost incurred by businesses on capital assets that are used in the business over a lifespan of multiple years.  Such costs are amortised in the financial statements of businesses.  This amortisation (depreciation) is added back in the calculation of adjusted trading profits and relief for these costs is allowed instead under the capital allowances system.</p>  <p>  It is also standard practice in all OECD countries to allow trading losses to be carried forward into future years, in recognition of the fact that business cycles operate over more than one year. </p>  <p>  I would also note that a charge of the nature proposed by the Deputy would not be in keeping with our corporation tax system and the certainty that provides to business, and nor would it be coherent with the income tax system applying to business profits of sole traders and partnerships. </p></reply>

This approach ensures that the Exchequer is funded to meet the needs of citizens and a &lsquo;level playing field&rsquo; is maintained for the majority of taxpayers and businesses who are timely tax compliant.</p>  <p>  Revenue also accepts that taxpayers or businesses can sometimes experience temporary cashflow difficulties that impact on their ability to meet tax obligations on a timely basis. In such circumstances, Revenue&rsquo;s clear preference is to work with the taxpayer to agree a mutually acceptable payment solution in preference to deploying debt collection/enforcement sanctions. For example, in 2018, more than 9,000 businesses were granted a phased payment arrangement involving an overall liability of &euro;83 million rather than using debt collection options. Any such arrangement will include a statutory interest component, which Revenue is obliged to apply.</p>  <p>  In general, cases are only referred for debt collection/enforcement action where a taxpayer or business fails to engage on the matter and offers no satisfactory proposals towards addressing the outstanding liability. In each case, prior to any debt collection/enforcement action taking place, the taxpayer or business receives at least two notifications from Revenue seeking payment and setting out the consequences of continued non-compliance. These notifications include specified timelines (normally 7 days for each notification) to make payment or to engage with Revenue on the matter.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that it will not deploy debt collection/enforcement action where a taxpayer or business fully engages in identifying a mutually acceptable solution. For this reason, it is very important that the taxpayer or business makes early contact with Revenue and does not ignore any notifications or demands for payment.  </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  The provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research around issues such as subsidence. Unfortunately, if an insurer is of the view that there is a significant probability of a claim for subsidence or flooding reasons because of where a property is located, it generally is not going to provide insurance cover.  This is because it will argue that there is no longer the possibility of a claim but the certainty of one and therefore this type of risk can no longer be described as an insurable one.  </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance (01 676 1914 or feedback@insuranceireland.eu).</p></reply>

Option 2 is for the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the estimated cost of allowing LPT as an allowable expense against rental income for Income Tax purposes is in the region of &euro;12 million in the first year and &euro;20 million in a full year. This estimate is based on LPT returns that indicate a property is a non-principal private residence and assumes that each relevant owner has sufficient rental income against which to offset the LPT paid. </p>  <p>  LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore the measure is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms, so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market.  The measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT.  I note that one of the recommendations of the 2015 review of the LPT carried out by Dr. Don Thornhill on behalf of the Minister for Finance was that LPT payments should not be allowed as a deduction to landlords against income or corporation tax. Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s view was that deductibility for landlords does not rest easily with the concept of the LPT as a tax on the amenity value of residential properties rather than as a business cost. Owners and tenants of rental properties both derive value from the amenity value of these properties (the owner in the form of the rent and the tenant from living in the property). This contrasts with the situation regarding local authority rates on commercial properties.  Owner occupiers are not allowed to claim LPT as a deduction against income tax. It is not appropriate on conceptual and equity grounds that they should.  Dr Thornhill considered that there was a need to ensure equity between owners of all residential properties,  whether owner occupiers or landlords, and that it would be inappropriate to allow LPT as a deduction against the taxation of income from rents on residential properties. The Inter-Departmental LPT Review Group that reported to me in 2019 was in agreement with Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s  recommendation and the rationale which underpinned it.</p></reply>

Option 3 is to enhance loss relief for landlords (or a sub-set of landlords), to allow relief for rental losses against other income sources in the same year. </p>  <p>  Currently, landlords can carry-forward their rental losses for offset against future rental profits, but cannot offset rental losses against other net taxable income in the current year, other than other rental profits from other properties. However, rental losses can currently be carried forward indefinitely against future rental income, even after the loss-making property has ceased to be a rental property. This is in contrast to the treatment of trading losses under Case I, where the loss relief effectively ceases when the trade ceases. The current system of rental loss relief has the effect of encouraging landlords to remain in the market, in order to avail of the loss relief against future streams of rental income. Allowing offset of rental losses against all other income could potentially encourage landlords to exit the market at an earlier date, once their losses had been fully relieved against other income. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in 2017, the latest year for which tax returns are currently available, there was approximately &euro;1.45bn in rental losses from prior years that were available to be offset against rental income in that year. Assuming losses of &euro;1.45bn to be available for offset and applying an average (blended) tax rate, the tax cost could be tentatively estimated at &euro;420m.  </p>  <p>  Revenue advise that approximately 10% of those with rental income in 2017 did not have other income sources, in which case there would be no extra tax cost for that segment. For all other taxpayers, the tax cost associated with such a change would vary for each taxpayer, depending on the nature of their income, their level of available losses carried forward, and their level of income.  Also, tax returns do not separately capture unused losses for residential and commercial properties, therefore this estimate includes losses in relation to commercial properties as well as residential properties. For these reasons, the estimate presented above should be considered highly provisional.</p></reply>

This was published as part of the Budget documentation in 2017. </p><p>Using a set of modest assumptions, the Department of Finance Tax Division modelled the above option in order to provide a high-level estimate of the potential costs of implementation. The assumptions used included the following elements:</p><p>- 10% of landlords might avail of the relief</p><p>- Average property in Year 1 of &euro;300k</p><p>- 2.5% capital appreciation each year. </p><p>The modelling suggests that the cost to the Exchequer in terms of CGT foregone could be of the order of &euro;78 million if landlords held their properties for 5 years and then sold in year 6.  The potential costs would be higher - of the order of &euro;157 million - if the properties were held for 7 years and sold in year 8. Notwithstanding the cost of such a proposal, other issues arise. These include the potential for abuse of any such relief; the incentive effects provided by such a relief to sell the property after a specific time and how to provide for rental properties purchased between 2011 and 2014, which attract no CGT on any gains made on their sale. </p><p>This work was provided to the Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure during the Finance Bill process. </p><p>However, it should be borne in mind that the above option, which goes down the Capital Taxes route, is only one approach that might be taken.

Individual landlords are subject to income tax, including USC and PRSI where appropriate, at the current applicable rates. Expenses incurred in connection with the letting of a property are generally deductible under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and wear &amp;amp; tear allowances are allowed for furnishings and fittings. A landlord may also claim mortgage interest deductibility, which in Budget 2019 was fully restored to the 100% rate, with effect from 1 January 2019. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to determine the cost of a change to the present method of taxing rental income, as proposed by the Deputy. Although income streams may be identified separately in tax returns, this segregation is not maintained throughout the tax calculation process. As a result, it is not possible for Revenue to associate particular portions of net tax due with particular income streams, and therefore it is not possible to cost a proposal regarding a flat tax or a separate rate of tax on rental income.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers, published by my Department on Budget Day 2017, identified the measure suggested by the Deputy as a possible long-term option. The report noted that this measure would represent a significant departure from current tax policy and, in addition to the cost of tax foregone by the Exchequer, there would also be significant administration costs associated with the development and implementation of a new system of taxation for rental income.</p>  <p>  Following due consideration, I have implemented certain options contained within the Report over a number of Budgets. Specifically, in Budget 2018 I announced a new, time-limited deduction for pre-letting expenses incurred on properties that have been vacant for one year or more (option 4). The objective of this measure is to increase the supply of rental accommodation by incentivising the owners of vacant property to bring these properties back to the rental market. As already stated, in Budget 2019 I provided for accelerated restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property (option 1).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding. The Memorandum does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations concerned.</p><p>The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties. The decision on whether to offer insurance, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers. </p><p>Since the establishment of the MoU, an increase in the provision of flood insurance cover has been observed in areas protected by flood relief schemes.  The most recent survey carried out by Insurance Ireland highlights that 84% of policies issued for residences and small businesses include flood cover, with 95% of policies having flood cover in those areas protected by permanent flood defences.</p><p>The Department of Finance has advised the OPW that it is continuing to examine how the level of cover in areas with demountable defences in particular, can be increased.  As part of the Climate Action Plan, it is reviewing the general challenges of property insurance and flooding, and has conducted a public consultation and met with key stakeholders to try and determine the nature and extent of the problem and also to see what solutions can be developed. </p><p>Consumers can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance ((01 676 1914 or <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>). </p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operates a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which provides financial assistance to households who are not able to meet costs for essential needs immediately following flooding or severe weather events.  The scheme is designed to alleviate hardship and is administered by the Community Welfare Service.  Further information on the scheme is available at <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>In relation to flood risk areas still awaiting flood prevention measures, on 3rd May, 2018, I was delighted to launch 29 Flood Risk Management Plans and &euro;1bn investment in flood risk over the coming decade.  These Plans are the output from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme - the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The Plans set out the measures proposed to address the flood risk nationally, and include 118 new schemes to protect towns, villages and cities nationally.  To achieve this, the Government has provided &euro;1 billion for investment in flood risk management measures over the coming decade, and work is now underway in progressing the first 60 of these as a priority.</p><p>This commitment is in addition to the significant investment and work on flood defence schemes, since 1995, which has delivered flood protection for over forty communities today by Flood Relief Schemes.  Construction of a further 11 flood relief schemes is currently underway across the country, and planning, design and development of a further 23 flood relief schemes nationally is already well advanced.</p><p>Furthermore, the Minor Works Scheme was introduced by my Office on an administrative, non-statutory basis in 2009.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. The works to be funded are carried out under Local Authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council.</p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.</p><p>Under this Scheme, over 530 Minor Works projects have been completed to the end of 2018, providing local flooding solutions to almost 6,800 properties with expenditure amounting to &euro;34.7m over the same period.  This year to date, 32 projects amounting to &euro;3.1m have been approved and notified to local authorities.Full details of this scheme are available on <i>www.opw.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low level of just 650 in 2010 to 3,398 in 2018.  As of end November there were 3,300 new registrations on construction related apprenticeships, and these are forecast to increase further up to 2022.   The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.  Arising from the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s two calls for apprenticeship proposals, an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management was rolled out in 2019.  Apprenticeships in scaffolding, quantity surveyor and roofing and cladding scaffolding and senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship are currently being developed into national apprenticeship programmes.  </p>  <p>  Construction skills are also being targeted through Higher Education programmes, including Springboard, and through further education and training programmes. In the area of Construction, there are 14 courses under Springboard+ 2019, providing for 374 places. To date 272 participants have enrolled in or accepted places on these courses. It is expected that this number will rise in the New Year as some of the approved course in the construction sector will not begin until the spring and others may have a second intake of students.</p>  <p>  In terms of upskilling the existing workforce, initiatives include the establishment of a dedicated NZEB Training centre in Wexford which is currently providing 10 NZEB training programmes to existing construction workers in areas such as plumbing, electrical, bricklaying, carpentry and plastering.  As of the end of October 2019, 322 people received NZEB training. In November 2019 the Skillnet Ireland board approved the awarding of funding to a new Skillnet named the Construction Professional Skillnet which will be promoted by the Construction Industry Federation. This network will seek to improve competitiveness of the industry through upskilling the workforce, and create talent pipelines by developing resilience, core competencies and accessible progression opportunities to a predominantly young workforce.</p>  <p>  The most recent review of the employment permits occupations lists concluded on 12th July with 34 submissions of proposals for adjustments, 8 of which were from the construction sector including CIF. Among the construction industry submission job titles were Fa&ccedil;ade/Curtain Wall Designer and Building Information Modelling Specialists &ndash; BIM Manager/BIM Technicians (Modeler).  A submission is due to be brought to Minister Humphreys before the end of the year.</p></reply>

CIF is currently seeking support from its members and employers for the shared apprenticeship scheme in order to progress the matter.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years from 2019 to 2022.</p>  <p>On 3rd of September last I confirmed, as part of a framework to provide more opportunities to increase the provision of Irish Medium education through new schools and the expansion of existing schools, that in some circumstances the language of new schools established in the coming will be designated as Irish. This included one of the two schools due to be established in Cherrywood over the period 2020-2022.</p>  <p>  The new schools in Cherrywood are planned to accommodate demand arising from residential development in the area. Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demographic demand in that area. Accordingly, as part of nationwide demographic exercises which my Department undertakes, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain information on significant new residential development. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development. This particularly the case with Cherrywood, with much residential development envisaged to take place in a short period of time.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is currently based in temporary accommodation. It is intended that the school will relocate to a former primary school building that is currently occupied by a special school when the building project for the special school has been completed.</p>  <p>  It is not possible for an interim move for the school to the site opening in Cherrywood in 2020 for a number of reasons including site restrictions and as there will be temporary accommodation on the site while the permanent school building is being constructed on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools is kept under ongoing review and in particular will have regard to the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. In the context of reviewing demographic demand, in conjunction with any capacity in an area, my Department intends to have additional engagement with patron bodies to incorporate their local knowledge on school place requirements. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence from the school in question and its patron body. The Department will take into account the issues raised in the correspondence and will liaise further with the patron as part of the wider engagement mentioned above.</p></reply>

In the 2018/2019 school year over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p><p>The 1975 Summary of Accounting Arrangements form the basis of the payment to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the operation of the School Transport Scheme.  In this regard, the Department reimburses Bus &Eacute;ireann for a range of costs incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme.Re-imbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost recovery basis only and the Department of Education and Skills do not pay any profit to Bus &Eacute;ireann relating to the School Transport Scheme.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) carried out an examination of the provision of school transport and completed its report in August 2017 &ndash; the C&amp;amp;AG Special Report 98.  The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs.  This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus &Eacute;ireann to be used solely for the purposes of the School Transport Scheme.  The balance on the uncommitted reserve of &euro;6.7m was repaid fully to the Department in December 2018.  </p><p>The school transport scheme is a demand-led service based on the number of eligible children who apply to avail of transport.  My Department works with Bus &Eacute;ireann to analyse costs to the scheme on an on-going basis while each year the company produces an audited statement of account.  This ensures that the financial information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann is in accordance with the relevant summary of accounting arrangements.  </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann provide the Department with an annual projected cost of school transport services together with a provisional spread of payments.  These figures are incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s annual profile of expenditure and are monitored on a monthly basis both in terms of the Department&rsquo;s monthly profile of expenditure and Bus &Eacute;ireann information based on actual costs versus projected costs.  Expenditure headings and profiles are discussed at monthly meetings held between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Where changes in projected expenditure occur a new year-end forecast is submitted by Bus &Eacute;ireann and reflected in a revised spread of payments. </p><p>Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus &Eacute;ireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 <i>Summary of Accounting Arrangements</i>.  Balances, where they occur, are accounted for in the following year&rsquo;s projected cost. </p><p>In October 2019, I announced a review of the school transport scheme  as it currently operates with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way  to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review are being considered by my officials and it is expected that a cross-departmental steering group led by my Department will be established shortly to oversee the review.</p></reply>

However, in exceptional circumstances applications can be considered where the number of redundancies is not entirely met, when the redundancies will have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. EGF applications must specify the number of redundancies that have occurred within the applicable reference period and must be submitted within 12 weeks of the end of that period.</p>  <p>  The collective redundancy notice for the company concerned refers to 420 potential redundancies during 2020 as a consequence of the closure of the plant.  My officials have sought details on the circumstances leading to the plant closure to clarify if it would come within the scope of the EGF.  In the event that a reasoned analysis of the link between the redundancies and globalisation can be demonstrated it would appear that the minimum qualifying number of redundancies within a 4 month period might not be met.  Accordingly it would be necessary to consider any exceptional circumstances that apply.  In this regard the ILO unemployment rate in Q3 2019 for the Mid-West region at 4.8% was slightly below the national average unemployment rate of 5.2%.</p>  <p>  The EGF Managing Authority will continue to monitor developments in relation to the proposed redundancies, particularly the number and timing of redundancies, and their impact on the local, regional and national economy.</p></reply>

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools that employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer/Board of Management.  </p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>The circulars in respect of pay for secretaries and caretakers paid by grant-funding and for those paid on a scale are set out in the circulars below:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The 'Take the First Step' campaign helps to break down apprehension that may be felt by some older individuals returning to education. The campaign is funded by SOLAS and delivered by NALA, the National Adult Literacy Agency.  Surveys are conducted each year the campaign runs, and are published in evaluation reports. The evaluations found that awareness in general increases with age, from 29% of 18-24 year olds, to 63% of 65+ year olds, highlighting the campaign&rsquo;s greater salience and impact with older age cohorts.</p>  <p>  Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are requested, by SOLAS, to consider how the needs of priority cohorts are being addressed, including the development of appropriate provision tailored to the needs of older workers.  As evidenced by the statistics available, FET is for all ages: in 2018, there were 1,800 learners who were 80 years of age and older. More than 100 learners were over 90. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises that, for older workers to remain in the workforce, they may need education and training interventions. Employers, in particular in SMEs, will require support to identify and address the skills needs of employees, including those who are in the older age cohorts, who are engaged in lower skilled work.

I am aware that some former residents have called for the current legislation to be implemented, i.e., that the bulk of the records would be disposed of, while other have called for the immediate release of the records.  Other former residents have indicated their support for the proposals contained in the Bill, i.e., the retention of the records subject to access being completely withheld for the proposed 75 year minimum period.  </p>  <p>  The Retention of Records Bill which I published earlier this year and which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas provides for the retention of the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, having been a member of Government when the initial decisions were made to proceed with legislation to provide for the retention of these records, that under the legislation establishing these bodies, the bulk of their records would, on their dissolution, fall to be disposed of, by way of destruction. </p>  <p>  Under the current legislation,  information provided to the Commission and the Redress bodies must be kept confidential and, with limited exceptions, disclosure of such information would be a punishable offence. Given that all individuals and parties participated in the work of the bodies on the basis of confidentiality and that former residents in particular provided information of a deeply personal and private nature to the bodies, the early release of the records would be anathema for some former residents and for their families.   </p>  <p>  The retention and eventual release of the records, therefore, required fresh legislation.  It is necessary that the legislation balances the public interest in the retention of these records with the right to privacy and related rights of all of those who engaged with the bodies. By ensuring that the records are retained and withheld from public inspection for a period of at least 75 years, the Bill balances these rights and minimises the risk of legal challenge to their retention and that the approach set down in the Bill is the appropriate way to proceed.</p>  <p>  However, the Government has decided to provide for an interim review of the operation of the legislation, to take place 25 years after the legislation is commenced. I will be bringing forward the necessary provision at Committee Stage to achieve this.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The Wexford school planning area which is currently served by five post-primary schools. Loreto College, Wexford which formed part of the Schools Bundle 5 PPP project, was completed in August 2018 and provides for 900 post-primary places. My Department also recently approved a grant to a post-primary school in Wexford town to provide an additional mainstream classroom and science lab and this project has been devolved to the school for delivery.</p>  <p>  The Gorey school planning area is currently served by two post-primary schools, including a 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2011 with some 820 pupils enrolled in the current school year.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>   Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four year period 2019 to 2022. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Wexford or Gorey school planning areas, the requirement for new schools will be kept under review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.

As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.</p><p>The majority of children with Autism attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.</p><p>Special classes enable students with more complex special educational needs who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. </p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.</p><p>The responsibility to ensure that all children with Special education needs can get a school placement is a shared responsibility involving the NCSE, schools management and Patrons, the education partners and my Department. However in the first instance this responsibility rests with individual schools boards of management. </p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide and has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. </p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>It is open to any school including special schools to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.</p><p>The NCSE has a team of local Special Education Needs Organisers who are available to provide parents with information about the supports that can be provided for children with special educational needs in schools and can also advise parents of the availability of special class placements in schools.</p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing. </p><p>The extent of new special class and school places being established in recent years shows the willingness of schools to provide special classes and school places and normally this is the case.</p><p>However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was activated on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified a shortage of special school and special class places right across south Dublin.</p><p>The NCSE has identified 82 children needing special education school places for this or next year in south Dublin.</p><p>This is the second time the power under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018) has been used.</p><p>The law contains a procedure through which the NCSE can test the capacity of schools in an area to provide more special education places and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education places available.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that children with special needs are provided with access to a suitable education.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time back in April in respect of the Dublin 15 area. </p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes. The new places will help these families and ensure that the children concerned have access to education. </p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>I published the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill in September the Seanad Report Stage on the Bill is scheduled for this week. The aim of the legislation is to improve how schools engage with students and their parents. </p><p>Under the legislation, schools will be required to prepare and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines. The national charter guidelines will be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing students and parents. </p><p>The legislation provides that the charter guidelines will set out the requirements on schools in relation to the content of charters, including the procedures for consulting with students and their parents on the review and development of school plans and policies.</p></reply>

In the 2018/2019 school year over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p><p>The 1975 Summary of Accounting Arrangements form the basis of the payment to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the operation of the School Transport Scheme.  In this regard, the Department reimburses Bus &Eacute;ireann for a range of costs incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme.  Re-imbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost recovery basis only and the Department of Education and Skills do not pay any profit to Bus &Eacute;ireann relating to the School Transport Scheme.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) carried out an examination of the provision of school transport and completed its report in August 2017 &ndash; the C&amp;amp;AG Special Report 98.  The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs.  This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus &Eacute;ireann to be used solely for the purposes of the School Transport Scheme.  The uncommitted reserve was repaid fully to the Department in December 2018. </p><p>The school transport scheme is a demand-led service based on the number of eligible children who apply to avail of transport.  My Department works with Bus &Eacute;ireann to analyse costs to the scheme on an on-going basis while each year the company produces an audited statement of account.  This ensures that the financial information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann is in accordance with the relevant summary of accounting arrangements.  </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann provide the Department with an annual projected cost of school transport services together with a provisional spread of payments.  These figures are incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s annual profile of expenditure and are monitored on a monthly basis both in terms of the Department&rsquo;s monthly profile of expenditure and Bus &Eacute;ireann information based on actual costs versus projected costs.  Expenditure headings and profiles are discussed at monthly meetings held between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Where changes in projected expenditure occur a new year-end forecast is submitted by Bus &Eacute;ireann and reflected in a revised spread of payments. </p><p>Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus &Eacute;ireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 <i>Summary of Accounting Arrangements</i>.  Balances, where they occur, are accounted for in the following year&rsquo;s projected cost. </p></reply>

This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. Key supports are provided under DEIS to support school attendance, participation and retention, including the Home School Community Liaison Scheme. </p><p>My Department also provides funding to a small number of centres which provide education for young people not attending mainstream schools. These include the following: </p><p>- <b>Youth Encounter Projects </b>(YEPs) are recognised Special Schools which provide education for children who have either become involved in minor delinquency, or are at risk, and have become alienated from the mainstream school system.  There are five such non-residential schools, each catering for up to 25 pupils aged between 10 to 16 years.  YEPs have additional resources to provide a comprehensive life-skills programme in addition to the normal curriculum. </p><p>- <b>The Line Projects</b>were established to bring together the community, parents, state agencies and relevant Government Departments in order to respond to the needs of young people who have dropped out of mainstream education.  My Department funds two such projects - Carline in Lucan and City Motor Sports, Dublin 8. They cater for young people aged 14 to 18 years. </p><p>- <b>The Cork Life Centre</b>which caters for young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who are out of the mainstream school system. </p><p>- <b>The Inspire Programme</b>, run by City of Dublin Education and Training Board. This project assists children aged between 12 and15 who are experiencing difficulties attending mainstream post-primary school and are at risk of leaving school early to remain engaged in education. </p><p>In addition to the above, under the <b>Dublin North East Inner City Initiative</b>, a number of developments are underway to improve educational outcomes for students in the Dublin North East Inner City and to address the recommendations of the Mulvey Report.  My Department is represented on the Programme Implementation Board and is working with other relevant Government Departments and Agencies to advance the relevant initiatives.</p></reply>

To realise our vision for education to more fully become a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion, we have set a target in DEIS Plan to continue to improve leaving certificate retention rates in DEIS schools from their current rate of 85% to the national norm, currently 91.6%, by 2025 (Retention rates of pupils in second-level schools Entry cohort 2011, published by my Department). </p><p>Improvement in DEIS schools&rsquo; retention rates in recent years has been significantly higher than the overall improvement nationally. My Department&rsquo;s publication,  Retention Rates of Pupils in Second Level Schools 2011 Entry Cohort,  (those who entered post-primary in September 2011 and completed Leaving Certificate in 2016 or 2017) shows the Leaving Certificate retention rate for DEIS schools is 85%.  As the Deputy has pointed out the retention rates for non-DEIS schools is 93.5%, an 8.5% gap.  The Leaving Certificate retention rate for the 2006 entry cohort for DEIS schools was 80.1% compared to 92.7% for non-DEIS schools. In the five years from 2006 to 2011 the leaving certificate retention gap between DEIS and Non-DEIS has dropped from 12.6% to 8.5%. </p><p>My Department will invest approximately &euro;125 million in the current school year on the DEIS programme and this includes the provision of enhanced school book grants to DEIS Schools, enhanced staffing in DEIS Band 1 Primary Schools, enhanced allocation for dedicated career guidance counsellor in DEIS Post-Primary schools, enhanced National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) allocation time and the payment of a DEIS Grant to all DEIS schools. In addition all DEIS Urban Primary and DEIS Post Primary schools are included in the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme. The scheme is delivered by 415 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.<b></b>Additional funding is provided from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the School Meals Programme and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the School Completion Programme.  </p><p>Retention Rates to Leaving Certificate are one aspect of the overall evaluation of the programme. The Deputy will be aware the findings from PISA 2018 were published in early December and show that students in Ireland scored higher than the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science. </p><p>Since DEIS was first introduced, the Educational Research Centre (ERC) and my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate have conducted a series of evaluations on aspects of the programme and findings of this work are contained in a series of published reports. Evidence from this research to date demonstrates that the DEIS programme is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage and is succeeding in improving educational outcomes.  </p></reply>

The comparable processing date in the Dublin Visa Office on 11 December 2018 was 28 November 2018.  </p>  <p>  Processing times for other Visa Offices overseas and for Embassies will vary but are generally between 3 and 6 weeks at this time, with many applications processed inside those timeframes, depending on travel dates.</p>  <p>  I can also advise that the visa service is experiencing an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, in line with increased economic activity generally.  Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, better than the same time last year.</p>  <p>  The business target for processing employment visas is within eight weeks.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary.  The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Committees of the Judicial Council will be established by the Council having regard to the timelines set out in the Judicial Council Act 2019. The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee is to be established no later than 3 months after the first meeting of the Judicial Council itself and that Committee is to meet no later than one month after its establishment. </p><p>On 28 November the Chief Justice announced the membership of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee which is to be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  While the Committee cannot be formally established until the first meeting of the Judicial Council, a &ldquo;committee designate&rdquo;  held its first meeting during the course of the week beginning 1 December to embark upon appropriate planning and preliminary work. </p><p>The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will be responsible for drawing up personal injuries guidelines for review and adoption by the Council.  Section 18(4) of the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides that the &ldquo;Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee shall submit the first draft of personal injuries guidelines to the Board not later than 6 months after the date on which the Committee stands established.&rdquo;</p><p>The making of fraudulent and exaggerated claims has been the subject of much commentary recently.  The Government is working on a number of fronts to address the high costs insurers impose on their customers.  In particular the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 will make the offence of perjury easier to prosecute.  This will be particularly significant in the context of personal injury claims which contribute to the cost of insurance. I believe this will be strongly welcomed by the business community.</p><p>This Perjury Bill is a part of a package of measures dealing with insurance issues, insurance fraud and exaggerated claims. Of course it will also have general application in other areas. It will serve as a clear message to anyone engaged in legal proceedings that they need to be mindful of the need to tell the truth and that any deliberate departure from the truth may have serious consequences in terms of the level of sanctions and penalties that will be at the judge&rsquo;s discretion to impose. The Perjury Bill will serve to complement other Government legislative measures by providing a deterrent effect against those who may seek to abuse the law through the making of fraudulent claims, statements or declarations including in relation to insurance claims.</p><p>The Perjury and Related Offences Bill was initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the end of 2018 by Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and passed all stages there in June 2019. The Government has adopted the Bill on its legislative programme to facilitate its passage through the D&aacute;il and it passed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 December 2019.</p><p>I would also refer to the steps taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area. I have discussed the matter of insurance fraud with the Garda Commissioner on several occasions and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been closely involved in the Government&rsquo;s drive to encourage insurers to reduce the costs imposed on consumers.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has regular meetings with Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to discuss and act upon current and ongoing issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud. </p><p>In October 2018, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published Guidelines for the Reporting of Allegations of Fraudulent Insurance Claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These Guidelines to make it clear what insurance companies should do in the event that they suspect fraud in a personal injuries claim. The Guidelines were also circulated to the Chief Justice and the judiciary.</p><p>A new insurance claim fraud category on the Garda PULSE system went live on 1 November 2018. </p><p>Operation Coatee was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in April to tackle insurance related criminality and bogus insurance claims. Its focus is the prevention of insurance-related fraud and associated crimes on a coordinated basis throughout Ireland. In circumstances where insurance fraud has already occurred, Operation Coatee is designed to maximise the prospect of identifying suspected culprits, and, where possible and appropriate, to initiate criminal proceedings. </p><p>Furthermore, having given the matter careful consideration, the Garda Commissioner has decided that there will be a divisional focus on insurance fraud, aligned with the divisional-focused Garda model.  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide all Garda divisions in the investigation of suspected crimes and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.</p><p>The Table below shows the Primary and Secondary legislation progressed in this area since 2016. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Primary Legislation</th>       <th>Secondary Legislation </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>None </td>       <td>None </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>None </td>       <td>None</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>Section 13 of the Central Bank(National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 amending sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<br /><br /></td>       <td>None </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td></td>       <td>Circuit Court Rules (Personal Injuries: Section 8 Notices) 2019 (S.I.

These criteria will address quality concerns across a broader range of issues. They will address issues such as data governance, training, crime data recording procedures and the auditing and monitoring of data quality.</p><p>Earlier this month I noted the publication of a new statistical release by the CSO on Recorded Crime Detection 2018. I welcome the fact that improvements in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular in terms of data governance including upgrade of the Pulse system has facilitated preparation and publication of this report by the CSO. The report provides a snapshot of the extent to which crimes reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018 have been detected.  Detection is understood in this context as identification and sanction of at least one suspected offender; or, in a very limited set of circumstances, a verified exception whereby an offender is not directly sanctioned because, for example, the DPP decides that prosecution is not in the public interest or the suspected offender dies prior to any prosecution.</p><p>In publishing this report, the CSO explicitly confirmed that the report constituted a 'significant break' in the previous series for measuring crime detection rates in Ireland. This means that detection rates set out in the CSO report issued for 2018 are not comparable with figures published in earlier years.  </p><p>The report is available at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, given the pause in reporting on this issue by the CSO, it was not possible for me to provide a response to the issue raised in his earlier Parliamentary Question.  For the same reason it is difficult to provide data at this point for the earlier years referred to. </p><p>However, it is important to note that the most recent CSO report was made possible by progress in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has improved the quality and consistency of recording of crime data. This establishes a reliable baseline against which operational decisions can be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and further progress can be ensured and measured.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Policing Authority is responsible for overseeing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services, and accordingly has the primary oversight role in relation to these matters, including any issues arising from the historical inaccuracies in the recording of detections on PULSE.  The welcome clarity that the CSO has brought to this issue through this new and more reliable assessment of detections will be of assistance to the Authority in that independent oversight task and will also be of assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it continues to improve the policing services it provides nationwide.</p></reply>

The law in this area was most recently amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which amended the Licensing Acts and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the aim of reducing access to alcohol and at the same time strengthening measures to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The sale of alcohol products to underage persons is prohibited under licensing law. It is an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age. This applies equally to premises with off-licences, including supermarkets, convenience stores and similar outlets, and those with on-licences such as public houses, hotels and nightclubs. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between seven and thirty days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.</p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 32 of the 1988 Act, as amended, it is an offence for a person to purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years or to deliver intoxicating liquor to such a person. Under section 33 of the 1988 Act, as amended, it is also illegal for a person under 18 years to buy intoxicating liquor or to consume it in any place outside their home or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission.</p>  <p>  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 also provides the Garda&iacute; with significant additional powers to address the problem of alcohol sales to persons under the age of 18 years. Section 14 contains provisions which allow a Garda who believes with reasonable cause that a person is under 18 years and that he or she, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of consuming it in a place other than a private dwelling, to seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, the Garda may seize the intoxicating liquor if it is not handed over voluntarily. </p>  <p>  Section 14 of the 2008 Act also makes provision for the test purchasing of alcohol products. The primary objective of the scheme, which entered into force on 1 October 2010, is to enable the Garda&iacute; to target those licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales to young people. This scheme provides the Garda&iacute; with an additional instrument in its overall enforcement strategy. </p>  <p>  The Garda national age card scheme is an important proof-of-age mechanism in respect of the sale of intoxicating liquor. The scheme is administered by the Garda&iacute; and it has, in co-operation with the licensed trade, helped to combat underage consumption of intoxicating liquor. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which was amended by the 2008 Act, also permits the Garda&iacute; to seize bottles or containers containing intoxicating liquor where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour arising from excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor are investigated by the Garda&iacute; and dealt with in an appropriate manner, including by caution, fixed charge penalty notices or commencement of proceedings. </p>  <p>  In the area of public health, the overarching objectives of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 are to reduce alcohol consumption and to address alcohol misuse. It includes a number of provisions containing restrictions on the content, placement and volume of alcohol advertising. The aim of these restrictions includes the protection of children from exposure to alcohol advertising and to break positive associations between alcohol and social or sporting success. The Act also restricts the sponsorship by alcohol companies of events where the majority of those taking part are children or where events are aimed particularly at children.</p></reply>

One grant application for a CCTV scheme in Cavan has been refused by my Department, as it did not meet the statutory requirements for CCTV.

I understand that the DVDS enables the UK police to disclose information to a victim or potential victim of domestic abuse about their partner&rsquo;s or ex-partner&rsquo;s previous abusive or violent offending.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that taking into consideration relevant data protection law and measures in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was determined that such legislation was not considered necessary at that time.  </p>  <p>  However, my Department keeps all law under review on an ongoing basis.  As the Deputy will be aware, tackling domestic, sexual and gender based violence is a major priority for my Department.  Successive National Strategies on Domestic Violence, Sexual and Gender-based Violence have included wide ranging measures to eradicate such violence and protect victims.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that under the second National Strategy on Domestic Violence, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are responsible for the development and implementation of a Risk Assessment Matrix for all victims of domestic violence and sexual crime. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that good progress is being made on this action. Trinity College Dublin has conducted an academic review of the risk assessment tool and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pilot tool which was completed in Q1 2019.  A process review was then commenced which was completed at end of Q2 2019.  I am informed that it is expected that implementation of a risk assessment tool will be completed as soon as possible. This will then be introduced on a phased basis. Its use will commence in Divisions where Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) have been established. These specialised units are trained to ensure the needs of highly vulnerable victims are adequately catered for. It is intended to have DPSU&rsquo;s in every Garda division by end of Q1 2020. </p>  <p>  The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence also has actions undertaken to review perpetrator programmes. These are designed to rehabilitate offenders and reduce risk and distress to victims and society at large. Further, under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, Judges will now have the legislative power to refer domestic violence perpetrators to such programmes.</p>  <p>  The national domestic violence intervention programme , entitled the Choices Programme, also began in 2017. Choices is now being delivered across the State by the following three organisations working with men who engage in domestic abuse and in providing support to their partners/ex-partners; MOVE Ireland (MEND), South East Domestic Violence Intervention Programme (SEDVIP) and the North East Domestic Violence Intervention Programme (NEDVIP).</p></reply>

On arrival in the State, eligible spouses and de facto partners will be granted an immigration permission with a right to work without the need for a work permit.

It is being carefully considered by my officials.</p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision refers to the suite of State services and supports that are provided by a range of government departments and agencies to persons seeking international protection status.  It includes provision of medical cards, an exemption from prescription charges, access to education for children, a weekly payment, access to Exceptional Needs Payments, when required, and, of course, ensuring that all basic needs are met, like accommodation and food.  </p>  <p>  It is important to say that the system of providing supports and services to asylum seekers has been radically reformed in recent years.  Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has noted that system has improved considerably over what it was 5 years ago.</p>  <p>  The Paediatric Faculty's report recommends that families be provided with own-door accommodation and access to self-catering facilities.  I can inform the Deputy that a key part of our procurement process for accommodation centres, which has been underway across the country in the past few months, is provision for independent living with access to cooking facilities for all. It is a central theme of the new National Standards for accommodation centres which Minister Flanagan and I launched in August.  Indeed,  in recent weeks we have seen some new accommodation centres open in Borrisokane and Ballinamore where families seeking international protection have been provided with own-door, self-catering accommodation in accordance with the new National Standards. </p>  <p>  The new Standards also contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.  Children and their parents or guardians living in accommodation centres have access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children. They are also supported by the Child Protection Policies that we have put in place in the centres.  In addition, we have a Tusla official seconded to my Department to work with our  International Protection Accommodation Service. This ensures that any child protection issues are swiftly followed up and that the process for referrals is as streamlined as possible.</p>  <p>  However, I must say that the call made in the report for the abolition of the current system of providing shelter and support for international protection applicants immediately upon their arrival in the State is not a realistic one without also suggesting a credible or viable alternative.   Indeed the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application Process published earlier this month noted that there was no clear consensus as to what alternatives could or ought to replace the current system. That report also acknowledged that any new system of reception and accommodation will need time to ensure the right system is put in place.   </p>  <p>  The changes we are introducing to the system mean that our reception system compares favourably with what is provided in other EU Member States. This was noted only last month by the new Head of the International Organisation for Migration in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, an expert group independently chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, the former Secretary General of the European Commission, is currently examining the possible longer-term approaches to accommodation provision and is looking at best practice in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

When an applicant first sees a solicitor, they have to pay an advice contribution. The minimum advice contribution is &euro;30. Depending on an applicant&rsquo;s income, they might have to pay up to &euro;150. Clients must pay an aid contribution if they require representation in court.  The minimum aid contribution is &euro;130.  The amount of the aid contribution includes the advice contribution.</p>  <p>  There are some exceptions to the requirement for applicants to pay a contribution. Since September 2013 applicants for legal services in relation to defending childcare proceedings brought by the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) do not pay either an advice contribution or an aid contribution.  It should be noted that this applies only to the defence of applications for care orders and supervision brought by the Agency and appeals to the Circuit Court. It does not apply to cases where the applicant is the applicant/plaintiff in proceedings against the Agency pursuant to parts of the Child Care Act other than parts III and IV (except where such applications are ancillary to the defence of the main child care proceedings) e.g. for access to children in care.</p>  <p>  From the 1st of January, 2018 persons seeking civil legal aid in domestic violence cases in the District Court were no longer required to pay a contribution. Applicants for legal aid to assist with a claim for international protection only need to pay a contribution of &euro;10.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board can waive the contribution in cases of undue hardship.  The Legal Aid Board can recover the costs it incurred in providing legal aid in the event that money or real property is recovered or preserved on the legally aided person&rsquo;s behalf arising from legal proceedings. Again this can be waived in cases of hardship.</p>  <p>  In the District Court the vast majority of private family law cases are currently referred out to private solicitors and are not kept waiting, particularly if they have court cases pending.</p>  <p>  In the Circuit Court, the majority of family law cases (almost all of which are divorce and judicial separation cases) are handled within the law centres. Due to demand and budgetary constraints, legal aid applicants involved in these cases may have to wait for a first appointment with a solicitor.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the service provided, once a person is financially eligible for legal aid and is granted a legal aid certificate, the solicitor is required to deliver a full representation service to the end of the case.</p>  <p>  In law centres where waiting times are persistently long the Board may introduce an early advice only service so clients obtain timely advice about their legal rights while waiting for representation.</p></reply>

I also met a representative of the association, at their request, to hear their concerns at first hand. </p>  <p>  Essentially, the nature of the representations concerned a number of proposed amendments to the Bill to include a definition of private members clubs and, on foot of such definition, explicitly to exclude them from the scope of the Bill. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, provision for the licensing of such clubs was sought pending the major reform of gambling legislation planned by the Government. However, I was concerned that acceding to such a request at this point could be deemed to be licensing of PMCs as casinos, without having the necessary regulation in place.</p>  <p>  Legislation in my Department is prepared with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General. Having regard to that, I am assured that the 2019 Bill maintained the status quo relating to these clubs pending the intended future reform of gambling legislation, and did not affect their existing position arising from the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. The activities of PMCs are not subject to a particular licensing regime and they are deemed to enjoy protection under the constitutional right of freedom of association. The PMCs are, however, inspected for the purposes of tax compliance and the prevention of money laundering.</p>  <p>  I had assured the association concerned on a number of occasions, that it was not my intention to seek to challenge the current status or operations of PMCs.</p></reply>

This report feeds directly into initiatives already underway in Government as we implement the key recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, of which Dr Connolly was a member. </p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Government in December 2018 endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing and accepted all key recommendations. We are now progressing these recommendations through a high level implementation plan: &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation is the introduction of new legislation which, among other matters, should redefine policing to include prevention of harm.  However, it also recognises that prevention of harm is not solely a policing matter.   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other body within or outside the criminal justice system cannot, acting alone, provide the required response.  The report &ldquo;Building Community Resilience&rdquo; highlights the importance of developing a holistic approach to crime problems at a community level and it is this type of holistic approach with inclusion and involvement of the community that has been adopted in the North East Inner City in addressing issues in that part of the city.  </p>  <p>  That said it requires a considerable commitment from across Government and beyond, including from those in our communities, to deliver.  My Department is developing a policy focused on the concept of community safety with real cooperation between the range of actors involved in harm prevention in partnership with our communities.  The community safety policy will seek to deliver on these goals by strengthening the way agencies work together and work with communities.  </p>  <p>  Community safety is about being safe and feeling safe.  There are many reasons why someone might not feel safe and I want to ensure the Deputy that there is a coherent system in place to tackle the range of issues.  </p>  <p>  The Policing and Community Safety Bill being drafted by my Department will redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety. It will also provide for a new coherent governance and oversight framework to empower the Garda Commissioner to act as CEO supported and held to account by a non-executive Board, ensure strong internal governance and robust, transparent external oversight and effective accountability which will ultimately lead to a better run organisation and more effective policing. </p>  <p>  Work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Bill is well advanced with a view to submission to Government by the end of Q1 2020.  This is a major piece of legislation and the drafting process will be complex, however it is anticipated that the new arrangements will be in place in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In terms of protection for children from being lured into criminality, the Deputy may be interested to know of the "Greentown&rdquo; project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with the University of Limerick, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and supported by my own Department. Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. </p>  <p>  In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Government is currently providing record funds for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, and this is increasing to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  This investment is aiding the sustained growth of the organisation.  In addition, a total of &euro;92 million capital investment was made this year and this is rising further to over &euro;116 million in 2020. This unprecedented level of funding is provided  to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. </p></reply>

The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with the University of Limerick which is funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also supported by my own Department.

This is a statutory programme under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which focuses on preventing criminal behaviour as well as diversion from the criminal justice system and rehabilitation of children between 10 and 18 years of age.  The programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it is very important that it operates effectively.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly supported by a nationwide network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by this Department and operated by community-based organisations.  The projects receive referrals from a number of sources, but primarily from the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers.  </p>  <p>  Other developments in the operation of GYDPs include ongoing initiatives relating to personal mentoring, employment support and restorative practices. There is also important work to enhance service standards, including formal risk assessment of children referred.</p>  <p>  In the last year, the operation of GYDPs has been the subject of extensive consultation with service providers and community stakeholders. The intention is to devise an ongoing programme of development, backed up by evidence of effectiveness, which will ensure that high-quality GYDP services are available to every child in the State who could benefit from them. It is intended to support this process with an Action Research Project, working with selected GYDPs, to describe and clarify key actions and strategies to enhance the effectiveness of local projects.</p>  <p>  Garda Youth Diversion Projects are co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Social Fund as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings during this year which will continue into next year.  </p>  <p>  The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  It is intended that the Strategy will be finalised in the first half of 2020. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme is monitored by a Committee established under Section 44 of the Children Act 2001, whose annual reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand that the 2018 Report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Such approaches include the use of money-laundering legislation and focused intelligence-led operations by Garda specialist units, including the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Economic Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations with support as required from the Security and Intelligence section. </p><p>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other agencies referred to by the Deputy consult closely with one another including the Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC).</p><p>It may also be noted that the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996. The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>Officers of the Bureau are comprised of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Officers of the Revenue Commissioners and Officers of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime. Its structure and powers have been modelled by other jurisdictions. It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime won't be tolerated. CAB has been allocated the resources necessary to ensure its effectiveness and the recent expansion and development of the Divisional Asset Profiler Network now includes some 378 trained profilers throughout the State. These are key local level personnel who support the development and progress of investigations.</p><p>The Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme is a strategic offender management initiative led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service with active support and engagement of my own Department. It aims to develop and strengthen a multi-agency approach to the management of prolific offenders; prioritise such offenders for targeted interventions and supports to address their behaviour and through this work reduce crime and victimisation in local communities.  An initial evaluation into the effectiveness of this programme was carried out in 2018 and has shown very promising evidence that it is an effective approach for such offenders.  </p><p>I am open to considering any other specific recommendations that the Deputy or others would like to put forward for new approaches to tackling the issues raised. </p><p>Finally, it is important to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being provided with record investment to ensure it is adequately resourced to effectively tackle organised crime. &euro;1.76 bullion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, and this is increasing to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020. Supported by these record investments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation with over 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide supported by over 2,900 Garda staff. The growing workforce means An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is providing a more visible policing service throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p></reply>

Capping of awards by law but for the details of the cap to be delegated to some other regulation making body or a Minister.</p><p>4. A model  where the courts continue  to determine the level of awards for general damages through case law, as supplemented by the provisions of the Personal Injuries Guidelines under the Judicial Council Act.</p><p>The deadline for submissions on the Issues Paper is 31<sup>st</sup>January 2020 and I would urge those with an interest in this topic to make a submission to the Law Reform Commission.  I look forward to the publication of the final Report of the Law Reform Commission on this topic which I understand is envisaged for next year and will, of course, carefully examine any recommendations proposed by the Commission in what is undoubtedly a very complex area of law.</p></reply>

And capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020.</p><p>This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  We now have approximately 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff.

Taken together, this increase in Garda and civilian staff numbers means a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide in recent years.</p></reply>

It is available for collaborative projects seeking investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges.</p><p>A total of 63 applications were received under DTIF Call 2, of which 49 were deemed eligible following assessment by Enterprise Ireland. As DTIF is aimed at encouraging collaborative partnerships between consortia of at least three project partners, at least one of which must be an SME, the location of the individual partners is not a criterion for the Fund. However, on 7 December, when I announced the details of the 16 successful applicants under Call 2 of the Fund that were awarded a total of &euro;65m to be drawn down over three years, details of the location of the enterprise partners were included, along  with project summaries and funding allocations for individual projects, as per the attached document.</p><p>The lead partner in each of the 33 applications that were not successful under Call 2 will receive a communication from Enterprise Ireland detailing the feedback from the international panels of experts that had evaluated their project during the evaluation process. This feedback will set out the marks they received under each of the four criteria under which the applications were assessed, along with a supporting narrative including the reasons that the panel considered the application did not meet the qualifying mark, where appropriate. The communication will also direct the applicants to the relevant enterprise agency for support in identifying suitable alternative sources of funding.</p><p>The communication will also detail the appeal process, which can only be related to procedural issues, such as the evaluation process, admissibility or eligibility checks. Applicants must seek redress within two weeks of receiving the outcome communication if they consider that their application was not treated fairly or adequately on an administrative basis.  </p><p>Under Call 1, a total of &euro;75 million was awarded to 27 projects and Enterprise Ireland, who administer the Fund on my behalf, inform me that as of 16 December 2019, payments totalling &euro;12,160,733 have issued to the project partners.</p></reply>

This is reflected in Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland, which is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force.</p><p>A deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working, which was published by my Department on 6<sup>th</sup>December 2019. The objective of this research was to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such arrangements and the influencing factors for both employers and employees when considering remote work.</p><p>The Remote Work in Ireland report includes the outcomes from desk research, quantitative research and engagement with key stakeholders, including employer representative bodies and remote working interest groups. The report also includes an international policy review which considers relevant policies abroad. </p><p>One of the key implications for remote working in Ireland identified in this report is the need for guidance. Multiple stakeholder groups identified the absence of official guidelines for employers, employees and human resource professionals on the topic of remote work. As a result, many are unclear on how to manage the various aspects of what remote work entails. The main areas of importance highlighted in the research are:</p><p>- <b>Equality</b>&ndash; Fair and objective grounds for responding to a remote working request.</p><p>- <b>Health and Safety</b>&ndash; Topics of work-related accidents, balancing risk assessments with an employees&rsquo; privacy and clear procedures regarding bullying and workplace harassment when an employee is working from a hub or co-working space.</p><p>- <b>Employment Conditions </b>&ndash; Increased clarity and support in balancing employees&rsquo; right to privacy and the practical elements of performance measurement and monitoring working hours. </p><p>- <b>Data Protection</b>&ndash; Balancing data security and cybersecurity when engaging in remote work, particularly given GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which offers enhanced privacy protection rights to individuals in relation to the processing of their personal data.</p><p>- <b>Training</b>&ndash; Training for employees working remotely and for managers in managing distributed teams.</p><p>To build on the areas of importance outlined above, Future Jobs Ireland 2020 will commit to the establishment of an Interdepartmental Group comprising relevant departments and agencies to align approach and develop clear guidance for employers and workers on key aspects of remote work. This Group will be formed and commence its work in the new year.</p></reply>

Officials have also put together Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme information packs, which are available through this website. These sit alongside publications like the Quick Brexit Guide for Business and Currency Risk Management for Irish SMEs.</p><p>To raise awareness among Irish businesses of the suite of Government supports available to the, in July this year my Department published a report detailing the supports available to indigenous enterprises, including Brexit supports such as the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme and disseminates this at events, through the enterprise agencies, and through industry representative bodies.  </p><p>As of 6 December, there have been 6,763 participants at the Brexit Information LEO events and 5,402 SMEs have directly engaged with the InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service in 2019. This is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.</p><p>A recent survey of SMEs, which was undertaken by my Department, indicates that businesses are increasingly aware of and preparing for Brexit, with 77% of SMEs discussing Brexit at management level.</p><p>Brexit was central to my decision-making in the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. </p><p>In 2019 for example, I provided an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme.  I also provided extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.</p><p>Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding was increased by 22% in 2019, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The LEOs, which have a presence in every county, are working with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by Enterprise Ireland. The scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis. This scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. The Pilot Online Retail Scheme concluded this year and my Department and Enterprise Ireland will review its effectiveness. </p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland (ITI) was increased by 18% between 2018 and 2019 and it, along with the LEOs, is offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to businesses, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.  ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. In March, it launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with ITI paying 50% of total expenditure. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million &ndash; &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in April of 2019. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million. </p><p>The results from the UK election held on 12 of December 2019 present a further evolution of the Brexit context, and the Government and my Department are ready to support businesses, however events unfold.</p><p>In the coming year, I will continue to focus on proactively responding to the ongoing challenges presented by Brexit and be prepared for all Brexit scenarios. </p><p>The definitive allocations for my Department for the year 2020 will be determined as part of the normal estimates process, and the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume is set to be finalised and published in the coming days.</p><p>However, I can say at this point that compared to the 2019 allocation an additional &euro;8.8m in current expenditure and &euro;12m in capital expenditure is being allocated in 2020. The increase to the Department&rsquo;s current expenditure will allow for additional resources to be provided to my Department&rsquo;s regulatory bodies and its enterprise agencies to continue to prepare for Brexit, in whatever form it may take, by expanding and further developing the suite of available supports and by progressing the Global Footprint Initiative.</p><p>The first table sets out the uptake of Brexit preparedness supports available through my Department and its agencies as at 6 of December, 2019.</p><p>The second table sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019, and the cost/expenditure of Brexit-related supports to date. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>  ">Brexit preparedness supports - expenditure and allocation</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland has been engaging with Rondo Foods since 2011 and since the announcement by the company on the 8th November of possible redundancies, Enterprise Ireland has been engaging intensively with the company to see it is was possible to find a solution and avert the job losses. Unfortunately, however, this has not proved possible to avert these job losses and the company announced on 9th December that the factory in Arklow will close at the end of January 2020 and the facility will be relocated to Krefeld in Germany.</p><p>The Government will make every State support available to the employees of Rondo Foods. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is aware of the situation and we will be collectively, across Government, doing our utmost to help these workers transition and find new employment opportunities.</p><p>The staff of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) will be available to meet the employees concerned, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights. I would urge any employees who have any concerns about their employment rights to contact the WRC.</p><p>The company has confirmed on 9th December that all staff have been offered redundancy packages which exceed the scale of the mandatory statutory redundancy packages.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland was in attendance along with the Wicklow Local Enterprise Office at an information meeting for all Rondo employees on Monday 16th December which was organised by Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p><p>At the information meeting for all staff Enterprise Ireland provided information on: </p><p>- The Enterprise Ireland High Potential Start Up supports available for start-up food businesses and; </p><p>- The FoodWorks programme for high potential food businesses. </p><p>In addition to marketing Wicklow for new investment, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland continue to work with their existing client companies in the area with a view to encouraging them to grow and embed their businesses.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this extremely disappointing news, it&rsquo;s important to remember that the overall trend in terms of job creation in Co. Wicklow is positive.</p></reply>

The Employment Permits Section of my Department informs me that this quota has now exhausted. The application of a quota is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets. </p><p>The State's general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, the employment permits system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy led system.</p><p>Before consideration can be given to extending quotas, sectors needs to submit a business case clearly demonstrating that the recruitment difficulties are shortages across the EEA not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions. Sectors also need to detail the strategies in place for training/upskilling/career development and show that they are engaging systematically with the employment services of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, in this case, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Trade is an important part of the decision-making process.  </p><p>The occupation lists are subject to a twice yearly review and the most recent review has just been completed. Submissions received, including those from employer representative bodies in the sector, were considered as part of that review. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement of the outcome of the review in the coming days. </p><p>On 9th August a standard application for a General Employment Permit was received from the named employer (Details Supplied).  On 6th November 2019, this application was refused and the employer and prospective employee was informed of the reasons by writing.A review of this decision was received on 18th November 2019, and on 11th December 2019 the reviewing officer upheld the refusal and informed both parties in writing of all the refusal reasons including that: </p><p>- The Labour Market Needs Test was not carried out in the correct manner. The EURES advertisement was not placed for at least 14 days within 90 days prior to application being submitted and did not include the annual remuneration; and an advertisement placed in a national newspaper could not be verified.</p><p>- Evidence that the foreign national has a minimum of 2 years&rsquo; experience as a Chef was not provided nor were copies of any chef qualifications.</p><p>- Numerous other required documents were not provided (including an up-to-date tax clearance access number, letter from Local Health Authority stating that the employer has been granted permission to operate a restaurant or takeaway at the premises, and a copy of any utility bill).</p><p>It should be noted that, in order to assist with the application process, my officials have produced a suite of information including details on how to carry out the Labour Market Needs Test and a &quot;Checklist document for Chefs&quot; which, if followed, should have resulted in the granting of an employment permit.  This information can be found in the Employment Permit section of my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dbei.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

A number of projects which have been offered funding under, for example, the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), are already prototype ehubs and should develop over time into more sustainable ehubs in their own right.  </p><p>In the context of the further development of ehubs, as envisaged in Project Ireland 2040, in support of efforts to expand entrepreneurship and start-ups in every region, Enterprise Ireland is addressing the need to expand and further develop co-working initiatives including through existing community enterprise centres as set out in their recently launched regional strategy &lsquo;Powering the Regions&rsquo;. </p><p>The relevant projects funded as part of the first and second Calls of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 and December 2018 are set out in the tables below. In June 2019 I announced a further &euro;45m to be made available under this Fund and this third call for applications closed on 25th September 2019. It is expected that the successful projects in the third call will be announced in early January 2020.</p><p>Funding approved is delivered via grant support. Successful applicants in receipt of grant support must spend money upfront and then claim for eligible expense incurred from Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland inspects all grant claims to ensure all expenses are eligible for payment before the grant is paid. This process creates a time lag between the date of the Letter of Offer and the claiming of the grant by the successful applicant.</p><p>The successful applicants have 5 years to claim eligible expenses, in line with the agreed letter of offer.</p><p>Many of the projects approved under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund are new builds. These projects require approximately 18 to 24 months to go through the planning, procurement and build stages of the project.  </p><p>A breakdown of REDF funding approved for eHubs, Enterprise Spaces, Incubation/Food-Hubs, Co-Working and annual year to date funding drawn down is attached in Table 1 below.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;29.6 million was subsequently announced for investment by the Irish Research Council in &ldquo;frontier research&rdquo; projects in March 2018, with a further &euro;11.8 million announced in April of this year.  </p><p>As in previous years, the 2020 PRTLI allocation of &euro;24.72 million is being used to part pay outstanding bills for PRTLI Cycle 5 projects.  It also funds vital shared infrastructure essential to the third level research sector, including part payment of an annual subscription for e-Journals.  E-Journals funding provides Irish based scientists online access to a wide range of leading international scientific journals and is a necessary tool to enable them to conduct their own research. E-Journals formed part of the transfer of functions between my Department and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills as decided by Government order in May 2010.  </p><p>In addition, some of this money will be used to allow for dedicated funding for PhD/Research Masters enrolment through the Centres for Research Training.  This programme is administered by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and will fund postgraduate enrolments in disciplines under their remit. This initiative accords with the action in Innovation 2020 to increase postgraduate researcher enrolments, in disciplines aligned to enterprise and national needs.  The first intake of 126 CRT students commenced in September 2019.  </p><p>In 2018, my Department and its agencies were responsible for the largest proportion of Government investment in R&amp;amp;D at &euro;364.8m or 47.6% of total Government Investment.  Other Departments also provided funding for research and development across sectors. The Department of Education and Skills had an R&amp;amp;D outturn in 2018 of &euro;202.3m or 26.4% of total Government Investment in R&amp;amp;D while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine invested &euro;106.2m or 13.9% in 2018.  Overall Government funding of R&amp;amp;D in 2018 was &euro;765.7m and represents an increase of 3.6% over the outturn figure for 2017. Government investment in R&amp;amp;D includes funding for programmes that encompass all disciplines and all types of research.</p></reply>

The recently published report shows that the proportion of women on Irish Boards has risen from 20.9% in March 2019 to 25.3% by September 2019 - above the target of 25% set for end 2020. There is a strong business case for better gender balance at senior management and board levels of Irish companies, and setting targets is an important step in achieving positive change in this area.</p>  <p>   My Department is committed to supporting improved gender balance in the leadership teams at all stages of Irish businesses.  </p>  <p>  One of the objectives of my Department&rsquo;s National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland is to promote female entrepreneurship through the identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, and support for female entrepreneur networks. </p>  <p>  Both Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices have taken various steps to encourage female participation in entrepreneurship, such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s woman-only Competitive Start Fund and woman-specific training and mentoring run by the LEOs.  </p>  <p>  An important aspect of the LEO networking programme is the promotion of successful business women as role models, and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence in newly emerging women entrepreneurs.  </p>  <p>  The LEOs run a number of Women in Business Networks along with National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day. In 2018, 63% of participants attending core training programmes in Local Enterprise Offices were women.   </p>  <p>  In 2018, of the 132 successful High-Potential Start-Up and Competitive Start funding draws, 29 of those successful outcomes went to female-led companies. </p>  <p>  Another encouraging sign is an increase in angel capital going to female-led companies. Statistics from the Halo Business Angel Network show that 27% of deals financed by angel investors in the network went to businesses with at least one female founder in 2018, compared to 21% in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Of course, we want these figures to be higher and will work to achieve that.</p>  <p>  As part of the Future Jobs Strategy, Enterprise Ireland will shortly be announcing their new Female Entrepreneurship Strategy, which will have an action plan to increase the rate of female entrepreneurship and the number of women in leadership roles in Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  Finally, in November my Department announced a new postgraduate scholarship, in partnership with the Irish Research Council, to undertake  research  to develop an evidence base to support the development of policy to remove barriers and to create the supports needed to enable women to rise to the top of business and public service in Ireland.</p></reply>

In addition to supporting the provision of top-class research infrastructure (buildings, laboratories and cutting-edge equipment), PRTLI saw significant investment in human capital development, through Structured PhD/Emergent Technology programmes across Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). </p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, the Government's strategy for research and innovation, includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI to support new investment in research infrastructure, including buildings and equipment.  It also contains an action to increase the enrolment of PhD and research masters students. The scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI has been undertaken by my Department, working with the Department of Education and Skills (DES). </p>  <p>  While future cycles of PRTLI are referenced in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, it is important to note that actions are already being taken by DBEI and DES to fund all of the key elements that had been encompassed by PRTLI including research buildings, equipment and structured PhD programmes.  These actions include:</p>  <p>  - My Department, through Science Foundation Ireland, has allocated circa &euro;75m for research equipment across the higher education system since the start of 2016, providing significant additional investment for research equipment. </p>  <p>  - My Department, again through Science Foundation Ireland, has commenced roll-out of a new &euro;100 million programmes of investment in PhDs and Research Masters through new Centres for Research Training (CRT). The annual budget for this programme increased to &euro;15 million this year. The CRT programme will provide training for cohorts of Research Masters and PhD students with new cohorts of students enrolling each year for four years from 2019. It will provide training for 700 postgraduate students in areas of nationally and internationally identified future skills needs of digital, data and ICT. The first intake of 126 students commenced in September 2019.</p>  <p>  - As regards buildings, under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;2.2 billion has been earmarked for higher education infrastructure over the period 2018-2027.  This spending by the Department of Education and Skills will be focused on expanding capacity and upgrading existing infrastructure, as in other sectors, the funding increase will be gradual during the first half of the period.  Funding programmes include the Higher Education Strategic Infrastructure Fund which has five major projects and the Higher Education PPP programme, which incorporates eleven projects across the Institute of Technology/Technological University sector.  It also includes the funding of certain research activities, most notably by the Irish Research Council.  </p>  <p>  The actions being taken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are addressing to a significant degree the requirements for increased investment in both physical infrastructure and human capital in higher education research as identified in Innovation 2020.</p></reply>

The LEOs are actively supporting Irish companies to prepare and take action for Brexit through a range of supports and mentoring programmes.</p><p>Under the LEO Brexit Mentor Programme, clients work with an experienced mentor on a one-to-one basis to identify key areas of exposure within their business. With advice and guidance from their mentor, clients develop strategies that are more robust, which address issues and maximise potential opportunities around Brexit. The LEO Grant Management Information System was amended in August 2018 to record Brexit related mentoring information separately. Therefore, it is not possible to provide Brexit specific detail on mentoring participation prior to 22<sup>nd</sup>August 2018. The Brexit Mentor participation is as follows:   <table>    <tr>       <th>Period</th>       <th>Brexit Mentoring Participants</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>22nd August to 31st   December 2018</td>       <td>471</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1st January to 13th   December 2019</td>       <td>806</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1,277</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The broader LEO Mentor Programme is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. While mentoring participants in the period 2016 to August 2018 may not have been formally recorded as Brexit mentoring participants, it is assumed that a proportion of the LEO mentoring participants dealt with issues related to Brexit.  The following are the total LEO mentoring participants for the years 2016 &ndash; 2019:</p><p>LEO Mentoring Participants: <table>    <tr>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>1st Jan to 16th Dec 2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7,494</td>       <td>8,393</td>       <td>9,625</td>       <td>9,860</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of participants attending Brexit Related Events from the 24<sup>th</sup>June 2016 to the 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018 was 4,054 with 2,709 participants to date in 2019.

These measures are focused on: helping businesses across the country to identify key risk areas; providing information and advice on the practical preparatory actions that business can take; and making supports available to help businesses in addressing Brexit related concerns. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. In addition to offering support and guidance, the LEOs act to signpost businesses to appropriate supports. They also participate in and run events related to Brexit and offer Brexit-specific mentoring to businesses. Up to the 6<sup>th</sup>of December 2019, 1,271 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, for terms of up to three years, to eligible businesses to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. As of 12<sup>th</sup>of December there have been 919 eligibility applications received, of which 828 have been approved and 219 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;47.5 million. However, it should be noted that 160 of the total applications under the scheme are re-applications. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the reason for re-applications was that eligibility codes had expired.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme provides long term loans with a term of eight to ten years, to support strategic long-term investment. As at 12 December, there have been 2,506 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 2,350 had been deemed eligible. To date, 650 applications have progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;124 million.</p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) operates the Brexit Loan Scheme (BLS) and also the Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS). It has been actively promoting these schemes through attendance at numerous business-related events to inform and promote schemes and through promotional radio and digital campaigns which include Twitter and LinkedIn.  </p><p>My Department has a dedicated Brexit page on its website which includes information on the schemes available and officials have put together Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme information packs which are available through my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>My Department has also published a report detailing the supports available to indigenous enterprises, including Brexit supports such as the Brexit Loan Scheme and Future Growth Loan Scheme. This sits alongside publications like the Quick Brexit Guide for Business and Currency Risk Management for Irish SMEs.</p><p>The uptake as of the 6<sup>th</sup>of December 2019 across all the Brexit preparedness supports available to businesses is provided in the attached table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Uptake at 6 December 2019 unless otherwise specified</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td>       <td>919 applications for eligibility received, 828 approved by SBCI, 219 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;47.5 million.<br /><br />Of the approved applications to date, 160 were reapplications as eligibility expires after six months.<br /><br />Data as of the 12th December 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td>       <td>2,506 applications for eligibility received, 2,350 approved by SBCI, 650 loans progressed to sanction at bank level.

We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and we have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency.

However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p><p>The table below details the number of IDA site visits per county from 2018 until the third quarter of 2019.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-17a.759.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121700069#WRO05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 326 together.  </p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS) published in 2013 provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead. The strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural, and family life in their own communities for as long as possible. The strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.</p>  <p>  Many of the objectives included in this Strategy are broad and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people  into the future.</p>  <p>  New arrangements to implement and monitor implementation of NPAS were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in 2016. The revised approach recommits to the core principles of the strategy, establishes a mechanism to give stakeholder groups effective and ongoing access to engagement with bodies and agencies relevant to older people through an annual forum for stakeholders, and monitors the effect of the implementation process through the publication on a regular basis of a Positive Ageing National Indicators Report. </p>  <p>  The inaugural stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. Based on the success of and interest in the forum, a second stakeholder forum was held in 2018 and the third stakeholder forum was held in November 2019. Areas of action have been identified at each of these fora and the Department is providing support and communication to stakeholder groups who are engaged in furthering work in these areas, with positive outcomes to date, including collaborative work in relation to the redesign of housing adaptation grant application forms.</p>  <p>  The strategy comprises four national goals, developed to address key aspects of older people&rsquo;s lives. The four goals, and examples of progress to date thereunder, follow.</p>  <p>  National Goal 1:</p>  <p>  Remove barriers to participation and provide more opportunities for the continued involvement of people as they age in all aspects of cultural, economic, and social life in their communities according to their needs, preferences, and capacities.</p>  <p>  A key objective under this goal is to promote the concept of active citizenship and to encourage people of all ages to become more involved in their communities. Age Friendly, an organisation whose remit it is to help to create an inclusive, equitable society in which older people can live full, active, valued, and healthy lives under the guidance of the National Positive Ageing Strategy, have been very successful to date in this area. Age Friendly is a World Health Organisation inspired movement which embraces the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. In Ireland each of the 31 local authorities have signed up to the Age Friendly Programme. Older People&rsquo;s Councils have been set up and are running throughout Ireland as part of this programme, as well, ensuring a voice for older people in local government and community concerns. Implementation on this front does not rest with Age Friendly alone; there are many NGOs engaged in making Ireland a better country in which to grow old and they do so with the objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy informing their work.</p>  <p>  National Goal 2:</p>  <p>  Support people as they age to maintain, improve, or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy is strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where wellbeing is supported at every level of society. The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices. Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.</p>  <p>  Commitments within Government that further the strategy in relation to health and wellbeing include the development of a statutory scheme for homecare, which will aim to improve access to the homecare services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way, thus enabling people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  National Goal 3:</p>  <p>  Enable people to age with confidence, security, and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  Across communities many initiatives, strategies, and schemes are in place that firmly support this goal. One such is initiative is the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Older People Strategy, which aims to ensure the policing needs of older people in Ireland are met to the highest standards. This supports the objective of empowering people to live free from fear in their homes and communities, as they age. With regards to facilitating older people to live in homes which are suitable to their physical and social needs, the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government and the Department of Health are implementing, through a Joint Committee on Housing and Health, a framework for supported housing, to facilitate people to age well and healthily in place.</p>  <p>  National Goal 4:</p>  <p>  Support and use research about people as they age to better inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of the strategy implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the strategy and establish an on-going system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing. The Initiative monitors changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. This is done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators which are published every two years. The initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first Positive Ageing National Indicators Report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland. The second Positive Ageing National Indicators report is due to be published later this year.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding to many organisations that work with older people and further the objectives of the strategy. This funding is ongoing by its nature, as the strategy and the goals therein are intended as direction for future engagement for the continued promotion of older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.</p></reply>

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access.</p><p>Regulations governing the current pharmacy fee structure were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and are set to expire at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations must be replaced on 1<sup>st</sup>January 2020 to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p><p>In keeping with my obligations under Section 43 of the 2017 Act, my officials have undertaken a process of consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), as the representative body for the profession. My officials have met with an IPU delegation on two occasions where proposed fee restructuring was discussed. A detailed submission was received from the IPU. This consultation process has now concluded. </p><p>I met with the IPU on the 5<sup>th</sup>December, where I reiterated my intention to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the FEMPI regulations and to commence a comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract. In this context I also communicated my intention to maintain the current fee structure from 1 January 2020. </p><p>The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract in 2020 will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money.</p><p>However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes. Accordingly, any measures to be considered must be evidence based.</p><p>New secondary legislation is currently being drafted in order to give effect to the prescribed fee structure, as required under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.</p></reply>

The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The Department will progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019. The Department looks forward to the report of the Committee following from this engagement. In the meantime, engagements with the Office of the Attorney General will continue with a view to progressing the legislative development process. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p></reply>

Alcohol sponsorship of events aimed at children, events which the majority of participants or competitors are children and events involving driving or racing motor vehicles will also be prohibited. The objective here is to ensure that there is no place for alcohol advertising and alcohol sponsorship in relation to children's sporting events.</p><p>Minimum Unit Pricing will help to prevent alcohol being sold at pocket money prices so that it is out of reach of our children.  The 2013 Government Decision which approved a minimum pricing regime envisaged its introduction in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction simultaneously. It is my intention to seek a revised Government Decision so that minimum unit pricing can be implemented as soon as possible in order to address the very significant health harms and financial costs of the way alcohol is currently consumed here. I also intend to regulate price-based promotions of alcohol products in the future so as ensure that these products become less affordable for young people.</p></reply>

Of these, 14 patients are waiting less than 3 months. There are no patients waiting more than 15 months for cataract surgery. </p><p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government. In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and NTPF and made considerable improvements to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts. </p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of November 2019, they stand at 4,320. Of these, 448 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 90% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371.</p><p>More broadly, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2019. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. The Department of Health is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020, which will include ophthalmology services.  <b></b></p><p>In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020.</p></reply>

The National Service Plan 2020 will set out HSE planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient/daycase treatment and with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services. </p><p>In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020. </p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents.

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Two cannabis-based products have been deemed to have met the applicable criteria set out in the legislation and have been added to Schedule 1 of the legislation. </p><p>As these products will be subject to international export licensing requirements, which are outside the control of the Department of Health, they are not expected to be available in Ireland for a further period.</p><p>Once suitable medical cannabis products are made available by suppliers, the MCAP will make it possible for a medical consultant to prescribe a listed cannabis-based treatment for a patient under his or her care for the following medical conditions, where the patient has failed to respond to standard treatments: </p><p>-  spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis; </p><p>-  intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy; </p><p>-  severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>The Department of Health will make this information available on their website.</p><p>Pending full operation of the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  </p><p>Clinicians may submit an application on behalf of their patients to the HSE for reimbursement approval if the patient has a valid medical prescription for medical cannabis for one of the above medical conditions and have sourced a cannabis-based product which has been prescribed under a Ministerial license. </p><p>The HSE has advised that in the previous situations where it considered reimbursement support appropriate, the following steps were completed: </p><p>-  The patient&rsquo;s consultant is satisfied that all therapeutic options have been exhausted and is prepared to accept the responsibility for monitoring the patient&rsquo;s response to the cannabis product. </p><p>-  A prescriber applies to the Minister for a Ministerial license and this is granted. </p><p>-  The consultant completes an Individual Reimbursement Form, setting out the therapeutic benefit for the patient. It is important that this is completed in sufficient detail for therapeutic benefit to be demonstrated. </p><p>-  The Individual Reimbursement Form is considered by the Medicines Management Programme (MMP). </p><p>-  On review of the documentation, the MMP makes a recommendation for or against reimbursement support for the patient to the HSE, under the patient's eligibility, and informs the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) of that recommendation. </p><p>If approval is given, the PCRS, when authorised to proceed, will make the necessary arrangements to cover the costs involved for the patient.</p></reply>

This Group was established to examine how to give effect to the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation on the removal of private practice from the public hospital system. The Group recommends offering only Sl&aacute;intecare Type A (public only) contracts going forward, with pay parity limited to new Consultants who would take up this contract. It is through the implementation of this major Sl&aacute;intecare reform that issues in relation to Consultant recruitment, retention, pay and other conditions will be addressed.</p></reply>

No. 390/1981 - Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 and Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 276 of 2016).</p>  <p>  With respect to consent, including the age of consent, under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, tattooing and body piercing may be construed as a criminal offence if proper informed consent is not obtained; or in the case of minors, if tattooing or body piercing is carried out on certain parts of the body, with or without consent.  Consequently, any queries relating to these issues would be a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  In the absence of a statutory framework being in place, this Department and the Health Service Executive are developing guidelines in relation to tattooing and body piercing industry. It is anticipated that the publication of this Guidance will promote and enhance evidence based best practice in hygiene standards and infection control. Once published, this guidance document will set out a standard of practice in relation to infection prevention and control which all operators should adhere to. This will help to drive up standards and provide a safe environment for clients and practitioners.</p></reply>

Detailed policy analysis to underpin this very significant health capital development is required to guide service and operational specifications for the new facilities.

Period products can be either disposable (sanitary towels, tampons and panty liners) or reusable (menstrual cups, cloth menstrual pads and period panties). In Ireland, sanitary towels and tampons are subject to zero percent VAT. </p>  <p>  Motions on period poverty, proposed by the cross-party Women&rsquo;s Parliamentary Caucus, were passed in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday, March 13th, 2019, and in the Seanad on Wednesday March 27th, 2019.  Amongst other things, these called on the Government to provide a range of free, adequate, safe and suitable sanitary products and accompanying information, to be distributed throughout all public buildings.</p>  <p>  Following the Oireachtas motion, the matter was passed to the Strategy Committee for the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG) . An NSWG Period Poverty Sub-Committee has been established to progress this further, is chaired by my Department and includes representation from a number of Government Departments, agencies and NGOs, including the National Women's Council of Ireland.   The Sub-Committee has met three times to date; on 6th September, 17th October and 27th November, 2019.</p>  <p>  Terms of reference have been agreed; the Sub-Committee&rsquo;s initial priority is to establish the prevalence of period poverty in Ireland and the population cohorts most at risk.  Other commitments for the sub-committee are to identify possible measures to address period poverty, and to consider how these could be mainstreamed across Government Departments, State agencies and other public bodies. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Sub-Committee will present its preliminary findings and conclusions to the full NSWG Strategy Committee in Q1-2, 2020. Following NSWG approval, the report will be submitted to the Minister for Equality, Deputy David Stanton, by the end of Q2, 2020 and will include recommendations regarding methods to address period poverty, in line with the motions passed by the Oireachtas. This will be considered by Government and decisions will be taken in terms of implementation at that point. </p></reply>

The Task Force report was published in December 2017 and it was suggested that the time-frame for full implementation should be three years. The report made recommendations in 10 different themed areas. It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation that would be tasked with developing and/or implementing these as appropriate. </p><p>Since publication of the Task Force report, a number of the recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies for 2018/2019. The implementation of these recommendations has been on-going. A small number of recommendations require further consideration. It is anticipated that the majority of recommendations will be implemented by 2021. Related to this, approval is currently being sought from DPER to establish a Pathfinder inter-departmental unit on youth mental health. </p><p>In addition, the successor document to a Vision for Change also supports full implementation of outstanding Task Force recommendations before December 2020. A full list of updates on initiatives is attached for your information.</p><p>">Task Force</p></reply>

My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.</p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan 2019/2020 was launched by the HSE on Thursday 14 November 2019. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period. The increased pressures include a prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections. </p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams (WAT), each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) and associated Acute Hospital and Hospital Group (HG), have prepared Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  These Integrated Winter Plans have supported the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for Portiuncula Hospital will be delivered by Winter Action Team 2 (WAT 2), whose membership includes the CEO of the Saolta University Healthcare Group, the Chief Officer of CHO West, and the CEO of Portiuncula Hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding available nationally. This is being used to relieve demand for ED services, support discharge and other initiatives to help hospitals deal with the challenges associated with winter. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and the availability of home care, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to both facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.  Specific funding has also been allocated to the Winter Action Teams to support initiatives at local level. </p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. </p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the Emergency Departments.</p></reply>

This provides an opportunity for businesses to partner with the Department in supporting new planting.  The WEF involves an additional once-off top up payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare paid by the business to the landowner. There has been a positive reaction from the business community to this scheme, with An Post and Accenture already signed up and other businesses submitting formal expressions of interest in participating in the scheme.  At a recent event to promote the WEF, there was substantial interest amongst businesses in attendance in investing in the Fund.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my colleague Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I recently  announced that Coillte Nature and Bord na M&oacute;na are collaborating on a new project which will see bogs that are no longer being used for peat production transformed into rich native woodlands. Following on from this, we plan to actively engage with other public bodies in the near future to encourage them to identify possibilities within their land bank for the establishment of native woodlands.</p>  <p>  Promotion of woodlands and all their benefits is really important which is why in January of this year, my Department advertised a &lsquo;Call for Proposals for Forestry Promotion&rsquo; for the two years 2019 &ndash; 2020. This was a public call open to all and was aimed at encouraging initiatives under three categories; promoting the multifunctional benefits of forestry, promoting the planting of trees and forest management promotion. The response to the call was impressive, with 15 projects at a cost of nearly &euro;1m chosen.  </p>  <p>  I am very pleased that a number of the successful projects are aimed at both primary and secondary school children, as there is enormous value in educating children on the benefits of forestry. These projects seek to raise awareness of the essential place of forests in their  lives, through innovative learning activities and workshops, which include taking children out of the classroom and into local forests to learn about nature and trees.</p>  <p>  My Department expects to advertise a similar &ldquo;Call for Proposals&rdquo; in 2020, and  this will provide an opportunity for new proposals to be submitted for consideration, such as "foraois na bp&aacute;ist&iacute;".</p></reply>
