In relation to tourist/visiting anglers, the 21-day licence available at a duty of &euro;50 is particularly popular.Based on the recommendations of the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), and with reference to the Consumer Price Index, the duty for certain categories of angling licences, which were reduced in the prevailing economic circumstances in 2010, were restored to 2008 levels for the current angling season. The duty for a one-day licence was restored to the 2008 level of &euro;36. </p><p>  Licensing duties in Ireland are relatively consistent with similar costs internationally. In addition, unlike other countries angling licences in Ireland are required only for salmon and sea-trout over 40 cms and angling for all other species does not require a licence or attract a duty.</p></reply>

Additionally, there is a further commitment to develop a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters.   The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is one of the major Government policies to help deliver on the ambition in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. The RESS is an auction-based support scheme which invites grid-scale renewable electricity generation projects to compete to receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate. </p>  <p>  Over 1GW of new wind and solar generation was secured in the first RESS auction in 2020, and projects are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023. A significant volume of new renewable generation is expected to be secured in the second RESS auction which will take place next month. Alongside this, my Department is drafting the terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific RESS auctions. At least three offshore RESS auctions are currently planned for this decade. </p>  <p>  Achieving the target of up to 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources will entail investment of tens of billions of euro, including in the installation and maintenance of generation assets, and associated infrastructure and services, as well as in the development of supply chains and port infrastructure. In particular, significant grid infrastructure projectsÂ will be requiredÂ at both transmission and distribution level. In this context, EirGrid have committed to updating their &lsquo;Shaping our Electricity Future&rsquo; roadmap to assess the infrastructure required to meet Ireland's up to 80% renewable electricity target and deliver on our climate ambition.</p></reply>

They will introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives. New measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. It is estimated that each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and that there are over 16,200 life years lost. In addition, many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. The regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental challenge and will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p><p>  The primary focus of these regulations is on the large-scale commercial sale of turf. I recognise that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatland areas and the intention is to preserve customary practices in this regard. Final regulations will be agreed by Government in due course reflecting the ongoing consultation as to their exact content.Â We willÂ ensure that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat.</p></reply>

The Consultation is open until the end of May 2021.Â </p>  <p>  There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing a number of new schemes which will support the installation of destination charge points in these locations and will help provide critical links in the overall network for public charging.</p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that the Residential Charging Scheme and Destination Charging Scheme will be open to applications for fundingÂ  later this year.Â </p>  <p>  I would welcome applications from both Cork County Council for funding under these new schemes. While the SEAI has not yet received a completed application from Cork County Council for EV charge point funding, I can confirm that Cork County Council requested an application form under the Public Charge Point Scheme in 2021.</p>  <p>  Other supports that are available for EV charging infrastructure include the Home Charger Grant. </p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.Â  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600.Â Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV homeÂ chargerÂ grant to include multi-unit dwellings. This scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was also committed from the Climate Action FundÂ to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging twoÂ vehicles - Seventeen high-powerÂ chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This workÂ is substantially complete. 258 of the chargersÂ have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found atÂ esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport in Summer 2022.Â ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure.</p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays tuition fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual.

ETF investments can take many different legal and regulatory forms even where they are established within the same jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  An ETF is an investment fund that is traded on a regulated stock exchange. A typical ETF can be compared to a tracker fund in that it will seek to replicate a particular index. </p>  <p>  There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs. Â Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for such funds. The domicile of the ETF will generally determine the applicable fund regime, specifically whether the ETF falls within the domestic fund regime or the offshore fund regime. </p>  <p>  Where the domestic fund regime applies, a &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; applies such that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund but the fund has responsibility to deduct an exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund. To prevent indefinite or long-term deferral of this exit tax, a disposal is deemed to occur every 8 years.Â  Where the offshore fund regime applies, the applicable tax treatment depends on the location and nature of the fund.</p>  <p>  Income and gains arising from investments into Irish and EU domiciled ETFs are subject to income tax at a rate of 41% on a self-assessment basis. Such income and gains are not subject to Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) or Universal Social Charge (USC) liabilities.Â  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors, liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  To assist taxpayers in determining the appropriate tax treatment for investments in ETFs, Revenue has published guidance which is available at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-27/27-01a-03.pdf.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to review the taxation of Exchange Traded Funds.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8, 7 and 7.4 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area respectively in March. </p>  <p>  The rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Price spikes have been seen in a range of other commodities as well, including food, fertilisers and metals. Global supply chain disruptions, including the availability of inputs and transport bottlenecks, have also added to inflationary pressures. Domestically, the speed and strength of the economic recovery has led to an imbalance between demand and supply and put additional upward pressure on both wages and prices.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, energy prices increases will continue to be a key driver over the coming months. Inflation is now expected to peak at around 6&frac34; per cent in the second quarter and average 6&frac14; per cent for the year as a whole. Pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors such as food (via higher fuel/fertiliser costs) and consumer goods and services (due to higher energy inputs), and will add to core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, this year. Core inflation is expected to average 3.9 per cent for 2022 as a whole. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the impact of rising prices on citizens and businesses and has introduced a series of measures in recent months at a cost of over &euro;2 billion to help address the rising cost of living. This included a reduction in the VAT rate to 9 per cent for electricity and gas to end-October, an additional once-off lump sum payment in respect of the fuel allowance, a reduction in the PSO levy, an extension of the reduction in excise duty to mid-October and a &euro;200 electricity credit to all households. However, it must be stressed that expenditureÂ resources are limited, the priority is to</p>  <p>  minimise the impact on those who are most affected. The Government can help, but cannot fully insulate all from the burden of higher energy prices.</p>  <p>  Given the current dynamics at play, we must remain prudent in our approach &ndash; conscious that broad fiscal measures at this point in time could lead to further inflationary pressure which would be counterproductive in nature. My Department will continue to monitor the inflation situation closely and take appropriate actions when necessary.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.</p>  <p>  I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.Â Â </p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  The arrangements for further meetings of and timeline for progression of the review by the NDIS working group is a matter for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. I cannot comment on any possible changes in advance of proposals arising from the review.</p></reply>

The strategy outlines the plan to increase affordability and housing supply by committed to, amongst other things, an average of 2,000 new &lsquo;cost rental&rsquo; homes every year, with targets of rents being at least 25 per cent below market level. Additionally, in respect of properties in rent pressure zones, since 11 December 2021 annual rent increases are limited to 2 per cent per annum or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.</p>  <p>  With that said, as Minister for Finance I can only answer the Deputy's question in respect of taxation measures as any direct expenditure measures in this area are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  Tax relief in respect of rent paidÂ was previously available to those paying for private rented accommodation, including rent paid for flats, apartments or houses. It did not include rent paid to local authorities. This relief was abolished in Budget 2011 following a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation. As such, it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 08 December 2010.</p>  <p>  The view of the independent CommissionÂ was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation. Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would very likely be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the cost pressure on tenants.Â </p>  <p>  AtÂ the time of its abolition,Â the rental tax reliefÂ cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum and it is likely that this figure would be even higher today were a similar scheme to be put in place.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the foregoing, I have no plans at present to reintroduce a tax-based support for those in private rental accommodation.</p></reply>

These are as follows:</p>  <p>  1. Single Scheme: </p>  <p>  ThisÂ the mandatory pension Scheme for all new-joiner pensionable public servants since 2013. The Scheme's rules are set out in legislation and are outlined in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012. Section 40 of that Act specificallyÂ providesÂ for pension increasesÂ to be appliedÂ to pensions in payment in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>  <p>  2. Pre-Existing Schemes</p>  <p>  There is a separateÂ policy applying toÂ those public service pension schemes which predate theÂ Single Scheme.Â  It is important to note that the grant of increases for members of these schemes is a discretionary power of the MinisterÂ forÂ Public Expenditure and ReformÂ under section 29(2) of the Pension Increase Act 1964.</p>  <p>  Under theÂ current pension increase policy for pre-existing public service pension schemes, an individual'sÂ pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff. Â This means that the majority of retired members generally receive pension increases in line with the payÂ increases due to their peers in employment.Â </p>  <p>  The current policy has been in place since 2017 and was introducedÂ as an equitable approach to deal with theÂ differences between cohorts of pensioners depending on when they retired (i.e. those who retired post February 2012 did so on reduced pensions). These complexities wereÂ caused byÂ the introduction of FEMPI arrangements and their subsequentÂ unwinding. </p>  <p>The policy is outlined in detail in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 10/2021, which is available here: www.gov.ie/en/circular/e3bc7-instruction-on-the-pension-increase-policy-in-the-public-service-until-end-2022/   </p>  <p>  In summary, the pension increase policy for all new members of the public service since 2013Â is linked to inflation consistent with the relevant legislation and is the default arrangement for all new members of the public service.Â TheÂ existing pension increase policy for the members of pre-existing schemes remains in place for the period up until the end ofÂ 2022, in advance of which I will give dueÂ consideration toÂ the policy approach going forward.</p></reply>

This is a key element in the Government'sÂ Housing For AllÂ strategy and will enable home ownership through an equity share model, in which eligible purchasers are able to buy the homes at prices significantly below open market value and in return the Local Authority takes a percentage equity interest in the home.Â </p>  <p>  On 13 April 2022 I signed two sets of Regulations to govern the implementation of this scheme by Local Authorities, both of which came into effect that day and which were announced inÂ Iris Oifigi&uacute;ilÂ on 19 April. The Affordable Housing Regulations 2022Â set out the eligibility criteria for the scheme, including the specific gross income limit calculated with reference to the market value of each affordable home. The Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022 provide for a number of other matters, including the process by which Local Authorities will advertise homes, receive and assess applications, and operate a Scheme of Priority. These Regulations has been circulated to Local Authorities along with an Explanatory Note and an Income Assessment Policy.

This followed an initial reduction in processing time from 40 working days to 35 working days which was made in March, and is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 167,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p>  <p>  Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:  The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.  A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.  The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.Â  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.  The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.  In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.  Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year.</p>  <p>  There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes (primary and post-primary), providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. Budget 2022 also provides for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places from September next. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. Both my Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that Minister Foley and I recently announced the establishment of a new special school in Cork together with an update on the expansion of existing special class and special school capacity in Cork and Dublin.</p><p>In line with the demographics and as part of forward planning, it is envisaged that special classes will be required at most, if not all, post-primary schools.  </p><p>A range of measures to meet additional SEN capacity demands have already been put in place including the utilisation of spare capacity in existing schools and delivery of additional SEN capacity within the scope of existing building projects. Additionally, it is general practice to include a SEN Base in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless exceptional local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. The extent of provision made at these schools is informed by the level of demand in the area as well as the size of the school. </p><p>My Department, together with the NCSE, is monitoring the availability of places for students with special educational needs throughout the country as a priority issue and will continue to work with relevant stakeholders to ensure a supply of placements coming on stream to meet emerging demand.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children and young people are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

Total gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year, after income disregards and Child Dependent Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500; and </p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2021, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2022.</p>  <p>  The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependents of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, to effectively target this cohort, the income limit for the special rate of grant is aligned to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years. The student grant means test for 2022 is based on gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year.</p>  <p>  The income threshold for the special rate of grant is strategically aligned with the highestÂ Department of Social Protection rate as described in order to target students from households in receipt of long term social welfare assistance effectively. The income threshold changes when this Department of Social Protection rate changes so the estimate that the Deputy is requesting is not possible to provide.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware I did increase the special rate of grant payment itselfÂ  by &euro;200 as part of Budget 2022, along with all other student grant rates. For the 2022/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance the student is from the college attended.</p></reply>

This does not take account of any additional students who may choose to study in Northern Ireland should a change be made to the scheme to allow for the payment of tuition fees to students studying in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection from the State can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, I should firstly explain that anyone who wishes to make an application for international protection must proactively do so on their own behalf and on behalf of any of their minor family members. If they apply initially at their port of entry to the State they will still need to make a formal application at the Dublin offices of the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department. There is no need to make an appointment. Everyone completes their preliminary interview under Section 13 of the International Protection Act 2015 on the day they first attend the IPO offices. Therefore, there are no applicants waiting for a preliminary interview.</p>  <p>  Applicants will generally receive the Temporary Residence Certificate on the same day they complete their application if there is no language barrier and if the number of applications the IPO received on that given day is not excessively high.</p>  <p>  If an interpreter is required to assist them or for other reasons beyond the control of the IPO, the applicant may need to be called back to complete their application. The call back appointment is usually arranged quickly, unless there is a difficulty with sourcing an interpreter for the required language.</p>  <p>  In recent months, the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly with approximately 1,039 new applications received in the month of March alone. This has unfortunately impacted the IPO&rsquo;s ability to complete an application and issue TRC cards on the same day to applicants. There are currently approximately 937 applicants who need to return to complete their applications.</p>  <p>  The IPO has identified the practical efficiencies that can be made to improve the process and has put in place measures to ensure that the call back appointments are cleared as quickly as possible for the benefit of applicants allowing the majority of applicants complete the entire process on the first day. The target is to have up to 300 call back slots taking place per week to eliminate the backlog in the shortest timeframe possible, including by offering appointments at weekends. The IPO is determined to maintain the positive momentum around this approach and to continuing to ensure that the majority of new applicants receive their TRC cards on the day of application.</p>  <p>  You may be interested to know that the IPO received its highest ever number of daily applicants on 19 April 2022 (163 new applicants). All 163 people received their TRC cards on the same day, eliminating the need for call back appointments.</p></reply>

The National Diabetes Registry Demonstrator Project, funded through Sl&aacute;intecare, was paused as key HSE staff were redeployed onto urgent on-going COVID-19 work. Following substantial increases in investment in eHealth, the national diabetes registry is now being considered as part of a wider review of Ireland&rsquo;s health information strategy, and will operate as a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registry.</p>  <p>  Government approval was given this month toÂ prepareÂ the General Scheme of a Health Information Bill. It is envisaged that the BillÂ will include a provision to enable the operationÂ of disease-specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry, where information on disease diagnoses and treatment from healthcare providers is efficiently collated, combined and quality-checked from administrative records to create a database akin to an active registry for each disease.

Officials from my Department and from the HSE have held three rounds of discussions with the Irish Dental Association, the most recent on 2nd March when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the DTTS.</p>  <p>  I have now given approval for significant fee increases to be paid to contracted dentists across a number of items, including the Dental Examination and Fillings. I have also approved the reintroduction of Scale and Polish for medical card patients on the DTSS. These new measures are designed to address access problems for patients, and address dentist&rsquo;s concerns about the viability of the DTSS, while aligning the DTSS more closely with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by private dentists for PRSI patients.</p>  <p>  These measures should amount to an additional investment this year of about &euro;26 million over what was spent on the Scheme in 2021.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-27a.303.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700084#WRL01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government agreed in 2020 commits the Government to &lsquo;Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care&rsquo;. This is an entirely new scheme and separate to the "fair deal" scheme.Â </p>  <p>  Consequently, work is on-going within the Department of Health to progress the development of the new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not possible to give you definitive dates for new statutory scheme. This is because there are dependencies for these pieces of work that are beyond the control of the Department. Â Â </p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.Â  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.Â  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. Â The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Â The pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. </p></reply>

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and HSE has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  The provision of additional protected capacity for elective care is further confirmed by the Government Decision, in December 2021 and subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, on a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.Â  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on aÂ nationalÂ basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice.</p></reply>

One of the central priorities for me as Minister for Health is that waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures are improved, and that children receive the care that they need and deserve in a timely and appropriate fashion. </p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the wait time to see a respiratory consultant at Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin has been provided to my Department by the NTPF and is outlined in the attached document. The information is provided for Outpatient (OPD) and shows the number of patients on the paediatric Respiratory Medicine waiting list by time-band at Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital at the end of March. <table>    <tr>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> Respiratory Medicine Outpatient Waiting List (OPD), as at 1/03/2022 </p><p>Children's Health Ireland (CHI) Temple Street <table>    <tr>       <th>Time Band (months)</th>       <th>0-6Months</th>       <th>6-12Months</th>       <th>12-18Months</th>       <th>18+Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Respiratory Medicine</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>127</td>       <td>119</td>       <td>529</td>       <td>951</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>127</td>       <td>119</td>       <td>529</td>       <td>951</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the GMS and GP Visit Card contracts, the maximum number of medical card or GP visit card patients on a GP's patient panel may not exceed 2,000, or 2,200 if the GP also holds an under 6 contract, except in exceptional circumstances. There is no minimum number of patients specified for a panel. The State does not prescribe the number of private patients that may be registered with a GP;Â this is a matter for individual GP practices.</p>  <p>  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, the person concerned having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with.Â As private contractors,Â it is a matter for each individual GP toÂ decide whether to accept additional private patients.Â Information on the capacity of GP practices to accept private patients is not collected by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reform and service development will see the Government increase annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.Â Â In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with an intake of 258 planned for this year.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.Â </p></reply>

Medical practitioners are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to operate in accordance with best medical practice.</p>  <p>  This is the process that underpins the provision of healthcare services in this country, and this will remain the case in the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH).</p>  <p>  The new NMH is a vital project and work is ongoing to finalise the legal arrangements underpinning the planned relocation to the Elm Park campus. As I have previously said, the core objectives of the legal framework are to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - firstly, all clinically appropriate services that are legally permissible are provided for women who need them in the new NMH;</p>  <p>  - secondly, to prevent any influence, religious or otherwise in the operation of the new hospital; and</p>  <p>  - thirdly, to protect the State&rsquo;s investment, in relation to capital, revenue and service provision at the new hospital, for the public good.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I will bring a proposal to Government for approval to proceed once I am satisfied that the legal arrangements achieve the objectives set out above, and that all legally permissible services, including termination of pregnancy, will be provided in the new NMH as they are in the current hospital building at Holles Street.</p></reply>
