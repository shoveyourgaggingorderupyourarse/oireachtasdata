While the CSO's statistical Business Register contains a classification by legal form of enterprise, the statistics do not separately count family businesses. The closest approximation available is enterprises that are classified as Sole Traders or Partnerships. The latest year for which this information is available is 2018. Data for 2019 will be available in mid-July.</p><p>There were 270,344 enterprises in the private business economy in 2018, of which 141,916 (52.5%) were Sole Traders or Partnerships. These contributed 15.3% of total Persons Engaged and 4.2% of Turnover in the private business economy in 2018. The corresponding figures for the years 2015 to 2017 are provided in the table below.</p><p>The CSO's recent report on the Business Impact of Brexit on SMEs, which was published on Friday 11 June 2021, contains analysis of how small and medium enterprises have been impacted by and responded to Brexit: </p><p><b><i>Table: Contribution of Sole Proprietors / Partnerships to the private business economy, 2015 to 2018</i></b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Number of enterprises</td>       <td>Number of enterprises</td>       <td>Number of enterprises</td>       <td>Number of enterprises</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total  enterprises</td>       <td>248,843</td>       <td>250,033</td>       <td>271,166</td>       <td>270,344</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sole traders or partnerships</td>       <td>140,479</td>       <td>137,061</td>       <td>148,394</td>       <td>141,916</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Share of sole traders and partnerships in total private business economy (%)</td>       <td>Share of sole traders and partnerships in total private business economy (%)</td>       <td>Share of sole traders and partnerships in total private business economy (%)</td>       <td>Share of sole traders and partnerships in total private business economy (%)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprises</td>       <td>56.5%</td>       <td>54.8%</td>       <td>54.7%</td>       <td>52.5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Persons Engaged</td>       <td>17.5%</td>       <td>16.4%</td>       <td>16.3%</td>       <td>15.3%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Turnover</td>       <td>5.9%</td>       <td>4.3%</td>       <td>4.8%</td>       <td>4.2%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>1. If an Enterprise has the Legal Form of Sole Proprietor (sole trader), it does not necessarily mean there is only one person employed in the business. A Sole Proprietorship may have employees. Conversely, businesses with only one Person Engaged may have a legal form other than Sole Proprietorship (e.g. Limited Company).</p><p>2. The private business economy comprises the Industry, Construction, Distribution, Financial and Services sectors (NACE Rev 2 codes B to N, excluding code 64.20 &ldquo;Activities of Holding Companies&rdquo;) as classified by the CSO.</p></reply>

It has been an incredibly difficult time for such businesses.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive package to help the wide range of businesses during the pandemic, including travel agents, includes the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  In addition to these financial provisions, my colleague Mr Eamon Ryan T.D., Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Transport also provided access to the Refund Credit Note scheme which allowed travel agents to issue credit notes, underwritten by the State, to consumers in lieu of cash refunds. This measure helped further enhance the ability of travel agents to survive this crisis. </p>  <p>  These schemes have been vital in sustaining businesses and workers, getting us to the point we have now reached. With the economy now re-opening in clear phases, and vaccine roll-out comprehensively underway, the Economic Recovery Plan sets out a renewed package of assistance, investments and policies for a new stage of economic recovery, providing a clear pathway for the labour market and enterprise towards new opportunities.   </p>  <p>  The Plan includes in excess of &euro;3.5 billion in further labour market and enterprise schemes and just under &euro;1 billion additional funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).</p>  <p>  This Plan comprehensively expands the EWSS and PUP, and provides clarity and certainty for businesses and employees over the period ahead by outlining next steps.</p>  <p>  In addition, it extends CRSS as well as enhances the SBASC payment; extends the Commercial Rates Waiver until the end of September 2021; provides for a new additional Business Resumption Support Scheme; extends Tax Debt Warehousing until the end of 2021; and further extends the 9% tourism VAT rate until September 2022. Information on the wide range of schemes can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for the SBASC for Q2 2021 applications has been broadened in two ways.  Where businesses have a minimum turnover of &euro;50,000 they can benefit from a &euro;4,000 grant. This now includes businesses in non-rated premises, thereby benefitting self-employed people working from home, who meet all other eligibility criteria.  It also provides for a grant of &euro;1,000 for businesses with a minimum turnover of &euro;20,000 and a maximum turnover of &euro;49,999, with all other SBASC eligibility criteria applying.  Applications for this Scheme close on 21 July 2021.</p>  <p>  We are committed to the economic recovery of the country and work is ongoing across Government to ensure the assistance which will be in place is sufficient, targeted and sustainable.</p>  <p>  I, along with my colleagues, Ms Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, and Mr Eamon Ryan T.D., Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, am fully committed to doing everything possible to support all those affected by the necessary restrictions implemented due to COVID-19, and including continuing to help businesses survive until such times as they can begin to trade in a meaningful way again.</p></reply>

It provides important statutory payment protections for subcontractors in the construction industry who have been considered vulnerable in the payment cycle in that industry. It also provides a statutory entitlement to avail of adjudication as a means of swiftly resolving payment disputes that arise under construction contracts. </p><p>There is also a general prohibition in section 3(5) of the Act that a provision in a construction contract is ineffective if it provides that the payment of an amount due to an Executing party or the timing of such a payment is conditional on the making of a payment by a person who is not a party to the construction contract. </p><p>Section 6(1) of the Act provides a right for a party to a construction contract to refer a payment dispute arising under the contract for adjudication. When this right is exercised, the parties to the contract may jointly agree to appoint an Adjudicator of their own choice. In circumstances where the parties cannot or do not agree as to whom to appoint, a party may apply to the Chairperson of the Construction Contracts Adjudication Panel under section 6(4) of the Act to appoint an Adjudicator to the dispute from the Ministerial-appointed Panel of Adjudicators. The adjudication will then be concluded within a set timeframe in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  </p><p>As construction contracts, by their nature involve private contractual arrangements between parties, there is no statutory public register for cases where non-payment may have arisen. However, as stated above, the Construction Contracts Act, 2013 provides a statutory entitlement to avail of adjudication as a means of swiftly resolving such payment disputes in a professional and efficient way. Full details of the Construction Contracts Act, 2013 are available on the website of my Department at the following link: </p><p>.</p></reply>

They are not created to provide compensation for loss of personal income above this level or compensation for loss of profits for any sector.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors, and the new National Economic Recovery Plan includes &euro;4 billion of stimulus to fuel the economy and for businesses to recover and rebuild.</p>  <p>  The Plan has outlined the changes to the current financial supports as public health restrictions unwind, assuring that the CRSS will remain in place for businesses that have to stay closed. For businesses re-opening in June and July, they will receive a double payment for the first three weeks upon reopening up to a maximum of &euro;30,000. This will help firms with cashflow and to restock and re-engage with staff.</p>  <p>  The PUP is a statutory income support for qualifying employees and the self-employed who have lost employment due to Covid-19. Under the Recovery Plan to support the reopening of the country, the PUP has been extended beyond the end of June 2021, in recognition that some sectors will continue to be impacted. The scheme is due to close for new applications from 1st July 2021 due to the progress in the roll out of the vaccine programme and reopening of the economy. The PUP will continue to be paid at existing rates until 7th September, when the rate will commence a gradual reduction back to the Jobseekers rate on a phased basis.  Further adjustments are scheduled from 16 November 2021 and from 8 February 2022. As recipients are placed on to the &euro;203 rate, they will be transferred to standard Jobseeker terms commencing from this September. </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of the PUP who is engaging in self-employment can earn up to &euro;960 over a rolling eight week period and continue to maintain entitlement to PUP.  Where a self-employed person exceeds this threshold and works up to 24 hours per week, they may be eligible for the Part Time Job Incentive scheme which has been extended to the self-employed who transition from the PUP.  This enables a person to take up limited self-employment and retain a weekly personal payment of &euro;128.60. This scheme will be available to the self- employed until the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant (ESG) is available to eligible self-employed recipients who close their PUP and re-start their business.  The grant, of up to &euro;1,000, is payable to self-employed individuals who employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from similar business reopening grants from other Departments.  The ESG will continue to be available to self-employed people closing PUP claims on its current terms until the end of 2021, at which point it will revert to its normal rules. Self-employed people closing their PUP claim to reopen their business will be able to avail of this grant even if they have previously claimed it as part of a reopening in 2020.</p>  <p>  Details of the PUP and the ESG are available on the website of the Department of Social Protection, which has the remit for these Schemes.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is being extended until the end of 2021, the commercial rates waiver will continue during the third quarter of this year for those availing of it, the 9% VAT rate will be extended until the 1 September,2022, tax warehousing is being extended until the end of the year and will be interest free in 2022.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for the SBASC for Q2 2021 applications has been broadened in two ways. Where businesses have a minimum turnover of &euro;50,000 they can benefit from a &euro;4,000 grant. This now includes businesses in non-rated premises, thereby benefitting self-employed people working from home, who meet all other eligibility criteria.  It also provides for a grant of &euro;1,000 for businesses with a minimum turnover of &euro;20,000 and a maximum turnover of &euro;49,999, with all other SBASC eligibility criteria applying. </p>  <p>  Applications close on 21 July for this scheme.</p>  <p>  A streamlined Business Resumption Support Scheme will be introduced in September 2021 for businesses with significantly reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions. More details will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p></reply>

The Government approved funding of &euro;108 million for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s large-scale peatlands project to rehabilitate 33,000 hectares of peatlands. This project is seeing Bord Na M&oacute;na reassign employees from peat harvesting activities into rehabilitation operations while supporting the natural environment and biodiversity of the peatlands. </p><p>In 2020, following a public procurement process, Bord Na M&oacute;na were engaged by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to project manage, provide other professional services, and undertake restoration works within the designated raised bog network.</p><p>Since its appointment in April 2020, Bord Na M&oacute;na, overseen by a project working group, has undertaken significant preparatory works in advance of restoration measures at 9 project sites in the Midlands region, with a further 5 raised bog special areas of conservation to form part of this year&rsquo;s programme.</p><p>Combined, these schemes will support 350 jobs - taking seasonality into account, this equates to 230 full-time equivalent roles. Of the 350 jobs, approximately 330 will be from the existing workforce. </p><p>To date across counties Galway, Meath, Kildare, Westmeath, Offaly, Roscommon, Laois and Longford I'm advised that 152 jobs have been assigned.

I propose to answer Questions 45 and 46 together.</p>  <p>  The Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy (2018) acknowledges the role of data centres as part of the digital and communications infrastructure for many sectors of our economy.  The statement also notes that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system.</p>  <p>  Ensuring a continued secure supply of electricity is vital for the proper functioning of society and the economy. It is also necessary to ensure people and business have confidence in switching to electrified solutions such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has statutory responsibility, under S.I. 60 of 2005, to monitor security of supply of electricity and to </p>  <p>  take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. </p>  <p>  In this regard, on 8 June, the CRU published a proposed direction related to data centre grid connections. This direction, which is currently subject to consultation, proposes to prioritise the processing of data centre applications to connect to the electricity grid based on a number of criteria which are focused on security of supply. These criteria include location relative to grid constraints, ability to provide onsite dispatchable generation and/or storage and the ability reduce consumption when requested by the system operator. </p>  <p>My Department is also carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. The review will consider the impact of increased electricity demand, including from data centres.</p></reply>

The initial impetus in this area arises from the Single Use Plastics Directive (EU 2019/904) which has a transposition deadline of 3 July 2021. From this date single use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, balloon and cotton bud sticks may not be placed on the Irish market. This ban will also apply to expanded polystyrene cups and food containers and all products containing oxo-degradable plastic.  The Plan also details our ambition to lead EU efforts on dealing with disposable coffee cups through the introduction of a latte levy and an eventual ban on disposable coffee and cold drinks cups.</p></reply>

This will not impact the overall level of subsidy required for the NBP intervention. Payment of subsidy in 2022 will be linked to the achievement by NBI of milestones under the NBP contract and the 2022 allocation for the NBP will be determined as part of the 2022 Estimates process later this year.</p></reply>

UNCCD has advised that the Landmark Report has led to significant positive developments for the GGW. These changes can, at least in part, be attributed to the recommendations contained in the Landmark Report, supported by Ireland. The most significant development and a culminating milestone was the One Planet Summit, held on 11 January 2021, which saw the launch of a GGW Accelerator. The Accelerator will help all actors for the GGW Initiative to better coordinate, monitor and measure the impact of their actions and speed up implementation towards achieving the 2030 ambition.</p><p>  As a result of delays in finalising the Landmark report (Pillar 1), the launch of Pillar 2 has also been delayed compared to the envisaged timeframe.

I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 crisis. In April of last year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.    </p>  <p>  Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers. Those commitments were further supported through regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis. Ministerial consent was granted for this framework proposed by the regulator to provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand due to Covid 19 related remote working and studying from home.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. A combination of commercial investment and the State led intervention will ensure access to high speed broadband in every part of the country no matter how remote. Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps. National Broadband Ireland will address the remaining premises through the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p>  <p>  A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to a further 1.4 million premises, bringing its fibre deployment to some 1.8 million premises. SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services. Virgin Media is offering 250Mbps as a standard offering with higher speeds available to many of its customers across more than 1 million premises. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></reply>

This <i>Review</i>will examine the rail network on the island of Ireland in relation to improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility, supporting balanced regional development and rail connectivity to our international gateways, with the latter also considering the role of rail freight.  </p><p>The <i>Review</i>will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network and that scope will certainly include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the Wexford to Waterford line.</p><p>With regard to the Barrow Bridge, I can inform the Deputy that I am aware of the matter raised and indeed discussed the issue previously in the House in relation to this line generally.  </p><p>As previously stated, it is the case the line has been closed to scheduled services for almost 11 years now. The National Transport Authority and Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have agreed that, reflecting that fact, the bridge should be left in the &lsquo;open&rsquo; position for marine traffic as trade continues of course in the port of New Ross.  I am informed that the planned securing of the bridge in the open position in no way removes the future functionality of the bridge for carrying rail traffic should services on this line resume, nor, I would stress, does it in any way impede consideration of the line in the context of the <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>. I understand that Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will ensure the continued functionality of the bridge through scheduled movements which will allay potential concerns that may exist as regards the permanency of the changed position.</p><p>I look forward to the <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>and its consideration of the strategic potential of the rail network on the island of Ireland, including the Wexford to Waterford line.</p></reply>

In line with the gradual reopening of services, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have recommenced in a limited fashion. The further opening of the driver testing service will be the subject of discussions between Department officials and the RSA in the coming weeks.</p><p><b></b>The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority, and as a result it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels.  The driving test creates particular difficulties, given the need for a tester and a test candidate to sit in close proximity in the same vehicle for a substantial period of time. Testers are also moving between vehicles provided by test candidates, which are not controllable work environments.  </p><p>From the start, it has been clear that the first priority is public safety. We want to provide services, and we know people are looking for services, but we will provide them only to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p></reply>

It provides that where a flight is cancelled then a consumer must receive a refund within seven days. However, there is no legal onus on airlines to refund where a flight goes ahead.  ‎‎Mindful of the position that Government has taken in relation to international travel in the interests of public health, the matter of consumer protection, consumer refunds and particularly fair treatment of air passengers who choose not to travel on Government advice, has been high on my agenda since assuming Office. I have taken many opportunities to impress on the main Irish airlines that their treatment of passengers who choose not to travel, for example in following Government advice, needs to be fair and reasonable.‎‎I have sought clarification from the two main Irish airlines on their current rebooking policies. Ryanair has clarified that the expiry dates for vouchers that were issued for flight cancellations last year are being extended so as to enable passengers to make bookings when travel is open again. I understand from their response also that a rebooking can be made with no flight change fee for travel before 31 October 2021. Finally, Ryanair has also informed me that that vouchers that were offered to customers whose flights were cancelled can be converted to cash at any time or can be redeemed for future bookings.</p>  <p>  In continuing dialogue with the airlines, I will seek to ensure that passenger considerations are kept in focus.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of Employers' PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and to encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.4 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;565 million have been granted to 49,800 employers in respect of 579,400 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1 June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.</p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. The are no changes in respect of the qualification criteria for EWSS eligibility for the childcare sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August / early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding the position as to whether the EWSS will remain in place for childcare workers that would typically be in receipt of social welfare payments over the summer months, I would note that this is a matter for the each individual employer to determine as appropriate to their business needs.</p>  <p>  In general terms, where a childcare facility would normally close for the summer months but due to current Covid-19 circumstances, the employer wishes to keep the employees on the payroll to open the facility, or to retain the employees on payroll for training or curriculum development purposes, etc., then an eligible employer can remain in the EWSS. This was the also the case last year when the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was in place. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I would add that there is no distinction made regarding eligibility of the scheme or the subsidy amounts payable based on whether the business has closed or is operating with curtailed services due to the public health restrictions. All qualifying employers are entitled to claim the EWSS in respect of the eligible employees on their payroll.</p></reply>

This new measure is &lsquo;triggered&rsquo; when a residential unit is acquired on or after 20 May 2021, with the &lsquo;look-back&rsquo; 12-month period commencing at this time on a rolling basis. The units acquired during that period are aggregated. When the 10th unit is acquired, it is chargeable at the 10% rate and this rate also then applies to the other 9 units and to any other units acquired at the same time as the 10th unit. However, while any units acquired before 20 May 2021 are taken into account in establishing whether the threshold of 10 units has been reached, the 10% rate of stamp duty is not applied to these units but only to those units acquired on or after this date. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that multiple purchases by Local Authorities, approved housing bodies, and the Housing Agency are outside the scope of this higher stamp duty. In this regard, you should also note that when putting this Financial Resolution on a permanent statutory footing, I propose providing an exemption from the 10% rate for the provision of the  mortgage to rent scheme by private sector participants. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that the information sought by the Deputy in connection with forward purchase agreements is not collected by any Government Department.  However, I will explore with the Minister for Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage and Revenue whether it is possible to put in place a reporting regime for agreements of this nature.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, in line with the EU Solvency II Directive insurance framework, I cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide refunds to their customers, as this is a commercial matter. As the Minister for Finance, I am also not in a position to comment on individual cases.</p><p>Nevertheless, working to protect insurance policyholders during and after the COVID-19 crisis is a priority issue for Government, and is therefore included within the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. Throughout the pandemic, Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently called on insurers to treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. We have emphasised the importance of insurers supporting their customers during these difficult times by continuing to provide necessary reliefs, and responding to both the Government&rsquo;s insurance reforms and the pandemic by lowering premiums.  </p><p>Minister of State Fleming has had extensive engagement with insurers on these points, including a series of meetings in April at which he pressed the need for premium reductions in light of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. He outlined that upon renewal, the Government expects premiums to reduce for all classes of insurance, including motor insurance, and that insurers should consider increasing their risk appetite to provide increased cover in new areas. </p><p>This engagement was positive, with insurers indicating that they will lower premiums in response to the Guidelines. The issue of COVID-19 forbearance measures was included on the agenda for these meetings, and I understand that a number of firms indicated that they will also take account of COVID-19 restrictions when setting premiums. It is Minister of State Fleming&rsquo;s intention to meet with insurers again later in the year to review progress in this regard.</p><p>I am pleased to note that most of the main insurers operating in Ireland have twice renewed their commitment to forbearance measures announced by several members of Insurance Ireland last year. I believe it is important that insurers now take a long term view towards supporting their customers, as we work to rebuild the economy and recover from the impact of the pandemic.  Both Minister of State Fleming and I will remain proactive in engaging with industry on this matter, as well as working with colleagues to implement further key reforms, which I hope will go some way to improving the cost of insurance for all groups, including motorists.  </p><p>Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

The scheme gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis. One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties. By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. In accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Government, HTB was enhanced in July 2020.  </p>  <p>  The future of the HTB scheme, beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2021, is a matter that will fall to be considered in the context of Budget 2022 and the subsequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

For this year, the Stability Programme Update projected a deficit of another &euro;18 billion. This was before the announcement of a range of support measures in our National Economic Recovery Plan, which will add approximately &euro;2&frac14; billion to the deficit this year. </p>  <p>  In terms of housing, the Government has already made extensive commitments in this area, including a record Exchequer funding allocation of &euro;3.1 billion in Budget 2021. Total housing expenditure has more than doubled since 2016 and as of 2021, it will be more than 40 per cent above the peak level in 2008. It is therefore a gross simplification to suggest that providing additional housing is purely a matter of increasing Exchequer funding. </p>  <p>  While public investment has an obvious role in alleviating housing market pressures, there are also significant non-fiscal constraints. In particular, the public health measures needed to suppress Covid-19 have placed a direct restriction on the construction of new housing. The industry is now facing increased costs and difficulty sourcing building materials as a result of the pandemic, high international demand, and Brexit. There are also skills shortages within the construction sector, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades. As acknowledged in the report, simply increasing expenditure will not negate these capacity constraints.</p>  <p>  From a broader fiscal perspective, as we move beyond the extraordinary events of the pandemic, it is important to remember that it is neither sustainable nor prudent to run perpetual deficits. This fact is underlined by the European Commission&rsquo;s recent announcement that the General Escape Clause of the EU fiscal rules should not extend beyond 2022.</p>  <p>  Pre-pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s level of public debt per capita was one of the highest in the developed world &ndash; this level of debt has of course increased as a result of our response to the crisis. We must build up fiscal buffers to deal with the clear fiscal challenges ahead, so we can address future shocks by providing support at the right time &ndash; as we have done during the pandemic &ndash; and steadily reduce our public debt to lower and safer levels. Ireland cannot afford to become a fiscal outlier, as we saw during the crisis of only a decade ago.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Action Plan for Insurance Reform also commits to examine the forthcoming final report and recommendations of the Central Bank <i>Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets</i>and take any appropriate actions as deemed necessary, in light of the final report. The Central Bank&rsquo;s Interim Report, published in December, marks an important milestone in its review of the issue and summarises the initial observations from its ongoing market analysis and consumer research.  I look forward to the final report being published shortly.  </p><p>I note that the Central Bank has stated that differential pricing can be associated with both benefits and costs for consumers. Accordingly, completion of the analysis will be essential in order to ensure a full market perspective, evidence-based conclusions and in turn appropriately calibrated regulatory interventions as are needed to apply to the specificities of the Irish market.  In addition, the associated consumer research will also provide insights which will be essential to the Central Banks&rsquo;s overall analysis.</p><p>Both Minister of State Fleming and I have repeatedly called on the industry to treat its customers fairly and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  Minister of State Fleming has raised his concerns with the main insurers that dual pricing in particular may be unfair for some customers and that they be proactive in responding to the Central Bank&rsquo;s interim findings.  However, the Government also believes that prior to proposing solutions, it is essential that the Bank&rsquo;s Review be completed, to ensure remedies are evidence-based and do not impact consumers negatively, including impacting the ability of consumers to shop around for better deals.  This position is consistent with the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</p><p>In advance of the publication of that report, my Department is proactively considering issues raised in the general debate on this, including the Private Member&rsquo;s Bill proposed by Deputy Doherty in February.  As part of this work, it is examining recent developments in the UK, where the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a ban on the practice of &lsquo;price walking&rsquo; for motor and home insurers, to come into effect next year.  This is the practice where providers initially offer a lower premium to new customers, which is then increased in subsequent years on renewal.  While my Department is not directly consulting the FCA on its policy statement at this time, my officials are engaging, both through our Embassy in London and directly, with the UK Treasury on this and other financial services issues of relevance.  I would expect that during the course of its work, in particular following the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report, it will consult all relevant stakeholders as necessary to ensure any policy solution proposed is fully considered and evidence-based.</p></reply>

The surveys required for the development of the scheme will be identified in due course. The design process will also consider Natural Water Retention Measures (NWRM), including upstream water storage, as part of the detailed assessment of flood relief measures for the scheme. The process will include further consultation with relevant Stakeholders, and the general public will be given the opportunity to discuss and feed into the flood mitigation options under consideration for Clifden. </p>  <p>  Galway Co. Council, acting as the Contracting Authority, went to tender for consultants, to further develop the scheme for Clifden in March 2021.  I have been advised by my officials that the tender documentation and briefing material provided by GCC to the prospective tenderers for this tender competition included the full requirements for environmental assessments associated with a flood relief scheme of this nature. </p>  <p>  The tender competition has now closed and the Council is currently in the process of assessing the tenders, with a view to appointing consultants to progress the development of a flood relief scheme for Clifden in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors.</p><p>I was delighted that as part of the National Economic Recovery Plan launched on June 1<sup>st</sup>, I secured agreement from Government for a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for artists.  The Government recognises that bold steps are necessary for our invaluable and much treasured arts community to come back stronger than ever before.</p><p>I have recently established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the outstanding recommendations of the <i>Life Worth Living</i>report. The membership of the Group is drawn from Departments and Agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations, including the Basic Income Guarantee pilot. The Oversight Group held its first meeting on May 27<sup>th</sup>and is being chaired by my Department and joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members and as well as a representative of the County and City Managers' Association.</p><p>I have asked the Oversight Group to prioritise the manner in which a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for artists could be delivered. As work on the pilot scheme is just getting underway it is too early to be definitive about the exact nature of the pilot scheme at this point.  The Oversight Group is expected to report to me by the end of July.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the local authority to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.  </p><p>The allocation of local authority dwellings, including the prioritisation of certain households, is a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with their allocation scheme made under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Regulations. This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p><p>It is the local authority which assesses housing applicants, taking into account factors such as the condition and affordability of existing accommodation, medical and compassionate grounds, etc. The authority then prioritises the needs of approved applicants in accordance with its allocation scheme.</p><p>Decisions on the allocation  of social housing support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned. Each application must be considered on its own merits and the individual circumstances taken into account.</p><p>As Minister I am precluded by housing legislation from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in the provision of social housing support in individual cases.</p><p>Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims of domestic violence rests with my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I understand that the delivery of these services is managed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>In terms of housing services, in 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to local authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions whereby a household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p></reply>

Most of the funding from Central Government to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: housing, transport, recreational, education and environment. </p>  <p>  My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, covering a broad range of functions, including local authority housing, voluntary housing, homeless services, estate regeneration, energy efficiency retrofitting, housing grants, rural water schemes, urban renewal/regeneration, and fire services.   In order to achieve its business objectives, the Department allocates significant resources to an extensive range of organisations, including local authorities, dedicated agencies, and other bodies; some allocations, depending on the programmes concerned, are made on a national or other non-county basis in the form of grant funding.  </p>  <p>  Grant funding is provided primarily on the basis of vouched expenditure, as opposed to specific up front annual allocations, once all necessary requirements as detailed in grant assistance schemes are met by the bodies/organisations concerned and that appropriate systems and procedures are in place to ensure the exercise of proper financial controls.   Accordingly, the circumstances of funding being returned to the Exchequer do not arise. </p></reply>

In addition, any person or a planning authority may seek a court order under section 160 of the Act in relation to unauthorised development with a view to ensuring that the development works in question are not carried out or continued.   </p>  <p>  Provision for the recoupment of costs arising from enforcement action taken by planning authorities is provided for under section 154 of the Act. Section 154(5)(b) provides that an enforcement notice shall require that such steps as may be specified in the notice be taken within a specified period, including, where appropriate, the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure and the discontinuance of any use and, in so far as is practicable, the restoration of the land to its condition prior to the commencement of the development.</p>  <p>  Section 154(5)(c) further provides that if the steps specified in the enforcement notice are not taken within a specified period (not being more than 6 months), the planning authority may enter on the land and take such steps and may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in that behalf.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 154(5)(d) provides that an enforcement notice shall require the person or persons served with the notice to refund to the planning authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority, including costs incurred in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers. </p>  <p>  Section 154(7) further provides that if required, any expenses reasonably incurred by a planning authority may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person or persons on whom the notice was served. Alternatively, the costs incurred by a planning authority may be secured by charging the land under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, or where the person on whom the enforcement notice was served is the owner of the land, an instrument vesting the ownership of the land in the authority subject to a right of redemption by the owner within five years. </p>  <p>  Section 156 sets out the penalties that may be applied in relation to non-compliance with specific sections of the Act. In this connection, 156(1) provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.  It further provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both.  Under section 156(2) of the Act, where a person is convicted of an offence and there is a continuation by him/her of the offence after his/her conviction, he or she shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention continues and for each such offence shall be liable.   </p>  <p>  Accordingly, as indicated, there are already extensive enforcement powers available to planning authorities in relation to non-compliance with planning legislation. This planning legislation is in compliance with EU law and applies to all forms of development, including the operation of quarries. Under section 157(4)(AA), enforcement action may be taken against unauthorised quarrying at any time.    </p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. </p>  <p>  While I do not envisage that any further actions are required in relation to planning enforcement at this time, I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The reform agenda includes:</p><p>- Amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction IndustryRegister Ireland) Bill</p><p>Specifically relating to product legislation, since 2013, the Construction Products Directive (CPD)- 89/106/EEC has been replaced by the Construction Products Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (CPR). It sets out rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU. Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he/she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, Dublin City Council has been appointed as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions across the country and has created a Market Surveillance Unit within Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO).  Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p><p>The National market surveillance programme 2021 provides specific details on the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p><p>Separately, the Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.</p><p>In this context, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference have recently been adopted and include:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 <i>&ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; </i>in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - <i>&lsquo;Safe as Houses?

The full conditions for eligibility under the Scheme are available on the Pyrite Board&rsquo;s website at www.pyriteboard.ie.</p>  <p>  &euro;20m was provided under Budget 2021 to cover the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2021. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 300 additional dwellings in 2021 and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approx. &euro;166m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014. </p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that 2,889 applications have been received under Scheme and, so far, 2,413 dwellings have been included. A further 108 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, 108 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process and 260 applications were not successful. Of the 2,413 dwellings included, the works in respect of 2,148 are complete with the rest at various stages of progress.</p>  <p>  It is projected that approx. &euro;62.5m will be required under the scheme between 2022 and 2026.  Projected expenditure is under constant review and is updated regularly. It is unlikely that applications will cease entirely post end-2026 but its expected they will reduce at a gradual rate over time.</p>  <p>  The average all in cost of remediation of dwellings under the Scheme ranges from &euro;65,000 to &euro;70,000 per dwelling.</p></reply>

It has been an important contributor to social housing supply since its introduction on a pilot basis in 2005 and continues to be delivered by all local authorities, who source accommodation from the private market and Approved Housing Bodies.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of RAS, local authorities retain the responsibility to source alternative accommodation for a household accommodated under the RAS scheme, should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable. In such circumstances, it is a matter for the local authority to secure suitable alternative accommodation for the household. Another option is for households in RAS properties to source alternative accommodation themselves, independent of the local authority. Once the local authority is satisfied that proposed accommodation meets the needs of the household and conforms to standards for rental accommodation, the property may be brought into the RAS scheme.</p>  <p>  The Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements, which underpin RAS, as a form of social housing support. Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing. Recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations with regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued from the Housing Agency in 2011 recommending that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. This arrangement effectively allowed those households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  All tenants allocated RAS accommodation post 1st April 2011 were informed at the time of offer and allocation that, as RAS tenants are considered to be in receipt of social housing support, their housing need is being met and that they will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list. </p>  <p>  However, it was recommended that allocation schemes also provide a &lsquo;transfer pathway&rsquo; for new RAS tenants, whereby households in RAS have access to the transfer list in the same way as tenants in local authority accommodation. Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation. It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

With very limited exemptions, these apply to all private rented accommodation. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties, regardless of tenancy type, comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January and May 2021) do not permit rental inspections. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors. </p>  <p>  The CCMA Business Continuity Working Group met recently to discuss the further phased re-opening of local authority services in line with the most recent government guidance and planned easing of restrictions. Housing inspection services were discussed by the group. Following the Business Continuity Working Group meeting, a draft updated version of the CCMA Local Authority Services Framework for Future COVID-19 Pandemic Response document was sent to the CCMA for consideration. Its approval is awaited. Once approved, this framework will be circulated to all local authorities.</p></reply>

The aim of Mandatory Hotel Quarantine is to protect the progress which has been made in Ireland in suppressing Covid-19, and the achievements of the vaccination programme which is currently being rolled out. Guidance on all the requirements and measures in place for persons arriving in Ireland following international travel is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  All passengers travelling from Designated States must pre-book a place in Mandatory Hotel Quarantine prior to departure.

This applies even if only transiting through a Designated State and even if remaining airside. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs is not the responsible authority on the operation of Mandatory Hotel Quarantine, which is a matter for the Department of Health. There is an option to lodge an appeal on arrival based on personal circumstances and this will be heard within 24 hours. However, this is only granted in very limited circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to strongly encourage citizens to consult with the latest travel advice and Government guidance before undertaking any travel to or from Ireland at this time and continues to advise citizens that the list of Designated States is subject to change at short notice from the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has a Mandatory Hotel Quarantine helpline which can advise in more detail for exemptions and proof for exemptions.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.</p><p>In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms such as Defence Forces vehicle fleet. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p><p>Certain purchasing is carried out by the Defence Forces directly under delegation of financial responsibility which permits the Defence Forces to procure a wide range of goods and services directly, this includes the purchasing of non-armoured vehicles.</p><p>I am advised by the military authorities that the Defence Forces vehicle fleet currently consists of approximately 1,700 individual vehicles of different types and configurations. Of this number there are currently forty one (41) electric powered vehicles (EVs) and three (3) hybrid vehicles. Thirty of these vehicles were purchased in the last 2 years with 8 more to be delivered later this year.</p><p>The table below gives the full breakdown of the forty four vehicles by vehicle type and year of purchase. </p><p><b>Table 1: Breakdown of Defence Forces electric and hybrid vehicles by vehicle type and date of purchase for the years in question</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year of Purchase </b></th>       <th><b>EV - Saloon </b></th>       <th><b>EV - Buggy </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>2020</b></td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>2021</b></td>       <td>8</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>16</b></td>       <td><b>12</b></td>    </tr> </table> The Defence Forces maintain two fleets of vehicles; the military fleet and the administrative fleet. The military fleet, which consists of military specific vehicles such as armoured vehicles, trucks and off-road SUVs, comprises approximately 55% of the fleet. The administrative fleet are vehicles that can be purchased commercially such as saloon, stores vehicles and minibuses. They comprise approximately 45% of the Defence Forces fleet. </p><p>In line with Government policy in relation to the Clean Vehicle Directive, the Defence Forces are committed to procuring vehicles that have reduced carbon emissions. </p><p>Due to the specific nature and requirements of the military fleet of vehicles and the locations where they are likely to operate, these vehicles are Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) type and will be replaced, as required, with fossil fuel ICE vehicles for the reasons outlined above. The Defence Forces, however, endeavours to replace these ICE vehicles with more energy efficient models where possible. For example, the new SUV and Troop Carrying Vehicle (TCV) fleets will be replaced with EURO 6 compliant engines which will result in a 50% reduction in emissions compared to the older EURO 3 engines which they replace. </p><p>The Defence Forces has committed to replacing the administrative fleet with energy efficient (green vehicles) as the technology allows. To date the investment in energy efficient vehicles as outlined in Table 1 above amounts to &euro;1.2m inclusive of VAT. The Defence Forces has committed to spend a minimum of 6% of the vehicle replacement budget on EV starting in 2020 and a minimum of 8% in 2021, with a commitment to increase investment by a minimum of 2% of budget each subsequent year. Already in 2021 the Defence Forces have taken delivery of eight (8) EV saloons and an electric buggy. A further eight (8) EV stores vehicles have been ordered with delivery expected by year end.</p><p>The Corps of Engineers have also invested in supporting infrastructure with the installation of 19 EV chargers across 16 Defence Forces locations to sustain the enlargement of the Defence Forces Electric Vehicle fleet into the future. </p><p>I am satisfied that, with these new acquisitions and the planning for future clean vehicle procurements, the Defence Forces will continue to have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

This Department&rsquo;s most recent projections indicate continued increasing demand for post primary school places in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  Following such an analysis, a new post primary school (Carrigtwohill Community College) was established to serve the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area in 2016.  My Department currently has no plans to establish an additional new school in this school planning area, however, the requirement for school places will continue to be kept under review, particularly in light of the significant projected future growth in the population of Midleton.  In this regard, my officials will continue to liaise with officials in Cork County Council in respect of the draft Cork County Development Plan 2022-2028 (currently at consultation stage), with a view to ensuring appropriate provision for potential future school accommodation needs in all areas of County Cork, including Midleton.</p>  <p>  In addition, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p></reply>

For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1).  Budget 2021 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2021/22 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools. In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.  </p>  <p>  Each one point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule would cost approximately &euro;14.5m annually.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.

The risk of someone aged 55-64 with COVID-19 is 70 times higher in terms of death, over 20 times higher in terms of ICU admission and 5 times higher in terms of hospitalisation when compared to the risk facing someone aged 20-34 with COVID-19. I appreciate this change in schedule has been a cause of upset and disappointment for many in the education sector, and also in other sectors. </p>  <p>  The move to an age-based model supports the vaccination programme objectives by protecting those at highest risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death first regardless of occupation.  The Department remains committed to regular engagement with the education partners and will continue to engage with unions and management bodies on all issues concerning Covid-19.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible but who apply for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education and Skills on the suitability of placements for children with special needs.  Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO).  School transport is provided to children with special needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO.  Where a child has special educational needs, a parent/guarding should contact the school principal of the school that their child is attending who will assist in making an application for school transport to the SENO that is affiliated with their school.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005.</p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing.</p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council.</p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to</p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs.</p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

As part of the forthcoming Pathways to Work strategy, this has been increased to 150 Job Coaches, to further build on this capacity and what will be a crucial resource in assisting our recovery efforts. At present, 84 of these Job Coaches are currently in place. </p>  <p>  The annual cost of the assignment of 150 Job Coaches is estimated at &euro;7.1 million, based on relevant annual average salary. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by this Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is &euro;953 million. Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to be approximately &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a social welfare assistance scheme which is means-tested and provides a payment for carers who, on a full-time basis, look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention and where the carer's income falls below certain limits. The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and, in doing so, to protect the interests of the person in respect of whom care is being provided by ensuring that payment of the allowance is contingent on the provision of the necessary hours of care. However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care. The maximum period in which a person may engage in in employment, education and training is 18.5 hours per week and during this time, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. </p>  <p>  In responding to COVID-19, my Department made special provisions for those who may be most vulnerable and negatively affected at this time and have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. As the Deputy is aware, the Department introduced the following short-term emergency payment- the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). A carer whose work ceases as a result of COVID-19 and whose situation qualifies them for the PUP will get the payment along with their current carer income support, whether Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.</p>  <p>  .Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is not payable with Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as in order to qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance a person must be unemployed and looking for work. The conditions attached to the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance payment are fundamentally incongruent with the nature of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment. </p>  <p>  With regard to other supports available for carers it should be noted that the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all family carers providing full-time care and assistance, regardless of means. This is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe. The Grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance. Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for a &lsquo;standalone&rsquo; grant. As part of Budget 2021, I increased the Grant from its previous rate of &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850 &ndash; the highest ever rate at which it has been paid since it was first introduced. At the start of June the Grant was paid to some117,000 carers. The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is over &euro;265 million.</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. However, any changes to the current supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

Consequently, any decision made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation and rules set out in the trust deed and the rules of the particular scheme.  Trustees of pension schemes must act in the best financial interests of the scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially.  If there is a conflict of interest then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests. </p>  <p>  Measures were introduced in 2015 to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members. Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits. This affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits in advance of any proposed change taking effect.</p>  <p>  These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members, the Pensions Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme. Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a section 50 direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law.</p>  <p>  More generally, there is no impediment to scheme members, or a representative group for such scheme members, from communicating to the trustees of a scheme in respect of matters pertaining to that scheme.  In addition, any scheme members, or their representative groups, can make submissions to my Department in respect of the funding standard.  Any such persons wishing to engage with, or make a submission to, the Pensions Authority should contact that office directly.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  All recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means-test for fuel.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.  </p>  <p>  The standard capital means assessment rules for State Pension (Contributory) purposes apply to Fuel Allowance applicants who have capital. An applicant may have capital/savings of up to &euro;57,999 (i.e., equivalent to &euro;100.00 a week under capital means assessment rules) in addition to income of up to the maximum State Pension rate, and still be eligible to receive a Fuel Allowance. If an applicant has a second property (property other than their own home), then rental income from that property is assessed.  However, the capital value (less any mortgage outstanding on the property) will be assessed if the property is not rented.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at this time to change the fuel allowance means test criteria so that the value of a second property owned by an applicant is disregarded.</p>  <p>  With regards to the right of appeal, the fuel allowance scheme is administrative (non-statutory) and therefore decisions on claims cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, if a customer is dissatisfied with a decision not to grant an allowance, s/he may request a review of his/her claim by a different Deciding Officer.  It is open to applicants to supply any additional facts of information in support of his/her application.  However, if it is the case that they are simply not qualified for payment, a review will not overturn the previous decision.  If following this review, the applicant still does not qualify for the allowance it is still open to them to contact the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These measures have continued and, in particular, during the Level 5 periods of restriction in place over the course of the last fifteen months. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, CE participants due to finish on schemes since October 2020, have had their contracts extended on a number of occasions.  </p>  <p>  On the 11th of June Minister of State, Joe O&rsquo;Brien and myself announced further measures to support participants of both Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s schemes.  Under these measures, CE and T&uacute;s participants&rsquo; contracts will be further extended until the end of October 2021.  This will benefit 7,000 participants who have been granted contract extensions since last October and whose contracts were due to end next month.  These measures will also benefit over 4,000 additional existing CE and T&uacute;s participants whose contracts would ordinarily come to an end between July and October.</p>  <p>  These measures will ensure that schemes can fully re-commence service delivery in local communities, while also supporting participants who have been long-term unemployed.  This latest extension will also allow participants further opportunities to complete their training and work placement experience.</p>  <p>  Importantly, this final extension will also allow CE and T&uacute;s schemes to conclude participants&rsquo; placements on a co-ordinated and phased basis.  This will also facilitate the planned increase in the rate of referrals to fill existing and new vacancies to ensure that opportunities to participate on the schemes continue to be available to those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>  From the end of October there will be a phased exit of those CE and T&uacute;s participants who have benefitted from this latest extension over a number of months up until February 2022.</p>  <p>  To assist with this transitional arrangement, there will also be a short contract extension for those CE and T&uacute;s participants whose contracts would be normally due to end between November 2021 and February 2022.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 999,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The 2021 funding allocation for the free travel scheme is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Providing an accurate projection of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance is being paid is very difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the number of newly qualified people.  The fact that many operators have reduced fares for children and that in some cases children under five years of age can travel for free would also have to be taken into account.  Taking all of this into consideration, I am advised that the yearly cost of the measure suggested by the Deputy could be as high as an estimated &euro;6.1 million. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to all children in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance is being paid would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to the Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer's Allowance schemes, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carer's Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  This will benefit over 130,000 carers.  Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim also benefit from the Budget 2021 increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse / civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.  </p>  <p>  As of May, there were 89,523 recipients of Carer's Allowance. The estimated expenditure for the payment in 2021 is in the region of &euro;953 million. </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p>  <p>  By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week. For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%. For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  The ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model is used for the purposes of estimates such as the one requested. The estimated gross expenditure is an additional &euro;1.16m annually. However, it should be noted that is not possible to estimate the increase in the number of persons entitled to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if the means test thresholds were increased. This is primarily because it is not known how many people there are caring and working that are currently over the income limit but who could apply for/become eligible for Carer's Allowance if the income limits were higher. SWITCH cannot model behavioural responses in such cases.  </p>  <p>  SWITCH showed no distribution/poverty affects arising from the increase suggested by the Deputy. It is important to note that based on the Department's own analysis of the Carer's Allowance, some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard. Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the means test must be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The response to DSGBV is a cross Departmental and multi-agency issue with policy coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla supports some 60 front line DSGBV services around the country, and the Department has increased its funding to Tusla for this sector by some &euro;4.7 million this year. Overall funding now stands at a total of &euro;30 million for 2021.</p>  <p>  Clare Haven Services is based in Ennis, and provides emergency refuge accommodation and support to women and children experiencing domestic violence. The service also provides a 24-hour confidential domestic violence help line, court accompaniment services, and outreach supports in several towns throughout County Clare. Depending on the convenience or geographical location of service users, or the availability of refuge spaces, individuals in County Clare may choose to use services in Counties Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry, or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Rape Crisis Midwest is based in Limerick City, and provides an outreach service in the Ennis area for adult survivors of sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse. The organisation also provides telephone support and one-to-one counselling. Individuals may engage with the service via its Limerick base, or the outreach service in Clare. Other supports for survivors of sexual violence are also available in neighbouring counties, if convenient.</p>  <p>  In addition to services located in County Clare, Tusla supports national services that assist survivors of DSGBV throughout the country. Women's Aid and Dublin Rape Crisis Centre provide two 24-hour national helplines for victims of domestic and sexual violence. Funding for the two national helplines has increased in the context of increased reports of DSGBV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tusla also provides funding to the Men's Development Network and Men's Aid to operate two helplines for male victims of abuse. All of these services are available and open to survivors of DSGBV in County Clare. </p>  <p>  With regard to emergency accommodation for victims of DSGBV in Clare, Tusla is undertaking a review of these services nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that this report will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence in County Clare, and across Ireland, are met in the most appropriate way possible. I strongly support the work of Tusla and its funded service providers and I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.</p></reply>

The specialist team working with these children and young adults, the Separated Children's Team, is fully aware of and attentive to their aspirations and needs, especially for those whom their application for international protection has not yet been decided.  </p>  <p>  As you will know, applications for international protection are processed through the Department of Justice.  The Separated Children Team helps the children in their care to apply for international protection, they also provide assistance in completing applications for family reunification. Having decisions relating to their status made as early as possible is crucially important, however, some children arrive in their 17th year and their application may not be processed before they reach their majority. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of children in receipt of a service from Tusla's Separated Children team receive some form of residency permission before they are 18, and as such, will not avail of direct provision.  If a care leaver is waiting for a final decision on their international protection application, and they turn 18 years of age, they may be referred to the IPAS for accommodation.   </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s current practice; where a young person is deemed to be exceptionally vulnerable, they may continue to be accommodated in a Tusla residential centre or in their foster placement. </p>  <p>   In Budget 2021, I secured an additional &euro;5m for Tusla to provide dedicated services to accelerate the intake of children from Greek refugee camps. Tusla officials have developed a suite of care options to include expansion of residential care placements and development of specialist foster care placements.  The suite of additional services included additional aftercare supports for separated young people in aftercare.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2020 there were 64 children under 18 in the care of the Separated Children Seeking International Protection Team in Tusla and a further 93 young adults between the ages of 18 and 22 were in receipt of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  The impact of the cyber-attack on Tusla systems continues to be felt. Tusla continues to provide a vital service and is working hard to restore their IT systems and access to information. When proper access is restored I will ensure that you are provided with more detail on this matter.</p></reply>

In view of the extent of State support, increases are not justified at this time. </p>  <p>  One of my key priorities in Government is to achieve affordability of early learning and care and school age childcare. The Programme for Government commits to substantially reducing fees to parents while supporting quality service provision. The Government has been strongly supportive of the sector, particularly since the onset of Covid-19. We have provided substantial additional supports to allow services to operate sustainably throughout the pandemic, acknowledging that there are higher delivery costs and many extra practical and financial challenges to be met. One of the objectives of these supports was to ensure that the higher delivery costs due to public health requirements and lower occupancy were not passed on to parents.</p>  <p>  In addition to my Department's funding schemes, all services can currently participate in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which provides an average of 50% of normal operating costs for services, at a value of some &euro;35m to the sector each month. The EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates since October 2020, and is due to continue until the end of December 2021. Most businesses must demonstrate a 30% reduction in turnover to be eligible for supports under the scheme. When the EWSS was introduced in August 2020, I negotiated a special arrangement for registered ELC and SAC services to be exempt from this turnover test and I can confirm that these special arrangements will be extended for Quarter 3 of 2021. Officials in my Department are engaging with the Department of Finance in the context of wider proposals for the EWSS in Quarter 4. </p>  <p>  I recognise that early learning and care and school age childcare services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions and I am aware that there are service providers notifying parents of a future significant increase in fees. Given the substantial additional supports allocated to the sector, and the assurance that there will be no sudden withdrawal of Government supports, there is no case for an increase to fees paid by parents. </p>  <p>  I might add that where providers require further financial assistance in addition to current supports available, my Department operates a Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme. I would urge providers to apply for funding under this Scheme before taking steps to increase fees charged.</p>  <p>  For parents who might wish to find an alternative provider, there are 30 City/County Childcare Committees around the country who can assist in identifying services in their areas. Information on these is available at myccc.ie. Information on services registered with Tusla, including contact details and inspection reports, is available on Tusla's website.</p>  <p>  There are a number of measures in place to ensure affordability for parents. Families may be entitled to subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of early learning and childcare for tens of thousands of families. The scheme comprises of two types of subsidies:</p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy for children of pre-ECCE age who are availing of early learning and childcare services from an approved provider. The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level. </p>  <p>  - An income-assessed subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of early learning and childcare services from an approved provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family's reckonable income. </p>  <p>  NCS subsidies are awarded as an hourly rate for a maximum number of hours per week. Where parents are not engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 20 hours per week. Where parents are engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 45 hours per week. The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements, and engagement in work or study for just 2 hours confers entitlement to higher maximum hours of subsidised provision. This makes the scheme as flexible as possible.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, my Department will be developing a new funding model for early learning and care and school age childcare that provides additional resourcing to services subject to quality and affordability. An Expert Group has been progressing this work since late 2019 and I expect their report to be finalised in November. An essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations on a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC/SAC. </p>  <p>  Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the work of the Group. Frontier Economics, the Research Partner, have produced and published eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the early learning and care sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents. This research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the new funding model. </p></reply>

These supporting measures were designed to encourage sign-up, support readiness and facilitate the smooth operation of the NCS.</p><p>My Department provides an annual programme support payment (PSP) to compensate providers for the time they have to devote to the administration of DCEDIY funding schemes, including the NCS.  Training and support on registering for the NCS is available for providers from all City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and from Pobal, the scheme administrator.</p><p>At present, over 3,000 ELC and SAC providers are contracted to participate in the NCS.  My Department will launch a communications campaign on the NCS in the next month, which will encourage more providers to sign up for the NCS, and also inform parents of the supports which they can receive under this scheme.</p><p>I do appreciate the difficulties caused when a parent&rsquo;s preferred provider does not engage with the NCS. However, parents can access their NCS subsidy through any ELC and SAC provider which is registered to provide the NCS. Their CHICK number, which unlocks their subsidy award, can be used in any NCS-registered ELC and SAC service. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the DCEDIY funds a national network of City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) to support and assist families and early learning and childcare providers . A parent&rsquo;s local CCC will be in a position to provide them with information and assistance with locating a suitable service or childminder in their area that is participating in the NCS. Further information on CCCs can be found at www.myccc.ie.</p><p>With regard to <b>the cost of insurance</b>, I understand that there has been a slight increase in brokerage fees for the majority of ELC and SAC providers this year, but that there has not been a general increase in premiums for providers.  I understand that insurance costs remain at an average of &euro;60 per child per annum for full time providers.</p><p>Neither the Government or the Central Bank of Ireland can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, insurance reform is a priority for this Government. The Action Plan for Insurance Reform, which was launched on 8 December 2020, contains a range of deliverables in a number of Government Department policy areas. It is intended that the cumulative effect of the implementation of the actions will be to improve the insurance environment, in particular for businesses. I am a member of the Sub-Group for Insurance Reform, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste, which has been set up within the Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and Investment to implement these reforms &ndash; the sub-group will publish progress reports every six months. </p><p>Seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. In this regard, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups, including ELC and SAC providers.</p><p>With regard to the <b>pay of staff in early learning and childcare services</b>, I am very conscious of the need for improvement in pay and working conditions in the sector. </p><p>As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p><p>In December 2020, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the sector, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. On foot of this process, the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail has written to the Labour Court, who are currently examining whether to establish a JLC. If established, a JLC could lead to an Employment Regulation Order, which would establish binding rates of pay and conditions for the sector.</p><p>Work on the new funding model is relevant here. The recommendations of a dedicated Expert Group are due later in 2021 and will be central to addressing both affordability and quality issues. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services. </p><p>Finally, work on the Workforce Development Plan continues, with final outputs expected by the end of the year. This is expected to include plans for making careers in early learning and childcare more attractive.</p><p>With regard to the to <b>the availability of early learning and childcare places,</b>my Department monitors the supply of, and demand for, ELC and SAC places annually through the Early Years Sector Profile report. This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department.</p><p>Published data from the Sector Profile for the 2018/2019 programme year indicates that existing early learning and childcare provision, in general, meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.  </p><p>Nationally the vacancy rate in 2018/19 was 6%, which was an increase from 5% in the previous year.  Dublin City had a vacancy rate of 4% in 2018/2019, no change from 4% in 2017/2018.</p><p>Capacity data is not available for 2019/2020 owing to the impact of Covid-19 on supply and demand for services, however the nation network of CCCs have been working to monitor the availability of ELC and SAC places during Covid-19.  I understand from their valuable work, and from engagements I have had with representatives of the early learning and childcare sector, that the pandemic as resulted in a reduction in demand for ELC and SAC places, in particular for after-school care.</p><p>With regard to the <b>availability of places for babies, </b>the Sector Profile shows that while there are vacancies in centre-based care for babies, they may not be available nationwide.  The national network of CCCs can advise parents of the availability of centre-based care in their locality, and also of other options, such as childminders.</p><p>It is my intention to provide increased support to parents to enable them to have the choice of looking after their children at home up to the age of one.  This commitment is set out in First 5, in the first Strategic Action 1.1: <i>Facilitate mothers and fathers to care for their child at home during their first year</i>.  My Department is overseeing the introduction of a range of measures across Government to support this commitment.</p><p>My Department will continue to actively monitor supply and demand, and will continue to build on the progress achieved over the past decade in order to ensure that ELC and SAC services are accessible, affordable and high-quality, for all age ranges.</p></reply>

Pobal acts in this capacity as Scheme Administrator, and it is their role to follow up on individual cases. We would ask that Parents using the NCS be advised to direct queries in relation to applications and the operation of the NCS to Pobal as the Scheme Administrator who are best placed to address them promptly.</p>  <p>  My Department has referred this query to Pobal, who confirmed that the first start date of a subsidy awarded to this parent was from 2 November 2020. </p>  <p>  NCS subsidies are not paid from the date of application. Rather, NCS subsidies can only be paid once an application has been completed, a CHICK has been registered with a childcare provider and the parent confirms on the system that all details are correct. This measure ensures that public funding is safeguarded and that the investment is following the child.</p>  <p>  The parent in question submitted their first application on 19 October 2020, the subsidy was not confirmed from that date. There are a number of steps that take place once an application has been submitted. As the income of both parties is processed, a partner must be given a window to raise an objection to the processing of this data. As such, the income assessment did not begin for this parent until 26 October 2020, and the award commenced on next available payment week starting Monday, 2 November 2020.  Email notifications are issued to all applicants whenever they are required to take action to progress their application. In total the entire application process including the week the matter was with the applicant's partner took 2 weeks.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the applicant only confirmed three of the four child registrations; a registration is where the provider registers the child with their service and parents confirm the registration. The parent must confirm registrations  before subsidies can be drawn down by the provider. </p>  <p>  With regard to the fees charged by the cr&egrave;che in question, the NCS subsidies parents for the cost of their childcare. Childcare providers set their own fees, sessions and admissions policies. My Department has no role in determining the fees charged by childcare providers.</p>  <p>  Regarding HSE employees benefitting from the NCS, we are aware of the issue you raise caused by the cybersecurity attack and have made provision for it, to ensure HSE staff can still be awarded a NCS subsidy. Any HSE employee who has queries and need assistance with this issue should contact National Childcare Scheme Parent Support Centre Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm on 01 906 8530..</p>  <p>  Once the period for requesting a review has lapsed, it is not possible for an applicant or a childcare service provider to request a review. </p>  <p>  My Department has asked Pobal to contact the parent and the childcare provider in question directly to provide assistance and answer any questions they may have. </p>  <p>  The NCS Parent Support line is available to assist parents, and can be contacted by phone at 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm.</p></reply>

My Department is cognisant of its obligations as a data controller when responding to SARs and is responding on a case by case basis to individuals within the timeframes required by the GDPR.</p>  <p>  GDPR provides that the one month period for SARs may be extended by a further two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request. The data controller is obliged to inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of the receipt of the request including the reasons for the delay. The deadline for responding to SARs commences from the time the identity of the requestor is verified. My Department is responding to SARs in accordance with its GDPR obligations and engages with each data subject in relation to the progress of their request. </p>  <p>  The right of a person to obtain a copy of their personal data, contained in Article 15 of the GDPR, is not absolute. It is specifically limited by reference to the rights of others, which must not be adversely affected by the right of a data subject to obtain a copy of their personal data. Therefore, in responding to a SAR, my Department must consider the rights of the data subject and also ensure that the rights and freedoms of others are not adversely affected. The consideration of adverse effects and the balancing of rights test is a critical part of the SAR process and can be highly complex. My Department also has regard to relevant Regulations such as S.I.  No. 82/89 &ndash; Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations, 1989 where health data is included in a record. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General, developed guidelines which set out the steps that must be taken in response to each subject access request. </p>  <p>  In order to assist the processing of subject access requests and to vindicate the rights of data subjects, my Department has put in place a multi-disciplinary team which includes legal and data protection expertise. In addition, my Department has engaged external data protection consultants to support the processing of SARs.  </p>  <p>  Information relevant to making a SAR is available on my Department's website. The webpage also includes a detailed guide to making a SAR that provides responses to Frequently Asked Questions. The guide includes information on the different means available to make a SAR such as by email, post or other means.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also operates a dedicated telephone information line which provides information to callers on procedures for making a SAR in respect of records relating to the Mother and Baby Home Commission of Investigation.</p></reply>

This scheme will include a restorative recognition payment and a form of enhanced medical card. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) was set up to develop detailed proposals for the Restorative Recognition Scheme, which must then be brought to Government for approval. While the IDG must take account of the recommendations of the Commission, its considerations are not limited to those recommendations. The work of the IDG is underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by consultation with survivors.</p>  <p>  To support and inform the work of the IDG, a public consultation process took place during March and April. The input from survivors to that consultation is invaluable in order to develop a scheme that will have their needs at its core. I was delighted with the strong response to the consultation process with approximately 450 written submissions received and 17 online meetings held.

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation, is currently provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) sets out signatory obligations but does not set out a standard or recommended number of refuges. With regard to the provision of shelter for victims, a policy document "Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services", published by the Council, references two possible standards depending on the types of service provision in place. Tusla has applied the standard of one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population, with specific mechanisms for measuring population and calculation of shelter spaces. This standard applied by Tusla, reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges. </p>  <p>  Tusla has previously advised this Department that the cost of maintaining a single refuge space is in the region of &euro;100,000 annually. Accordingly, the provision of 331 additional spaces would require an additional &euro;33.1 million on an annual basis. This would not include the initial capital costs for the development of these additional spaces.</p>  <p>  With regard to emergency accommodation for victims of DSGBV, Tusla is undertaking a review of these services nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that this report will be finalised in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Action Plan aims to improve access, through childminding, to high quality and affordable childcare. The Action Plan sets out a pathway over the next 8 years towards regulation, support and subsidies for all paid, non-relative childminders. The Action Plan will involve change and will bring significant benefits for childminders, and for the children and the families using their services.</p>  <p>  A National Action Plan for Childminding Steering Group will be established shortly, to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan.  The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and consultation and communications.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders on the Steering Group, which will be chaired by my Department. Additionally the National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders on all four Advisory Groups.</p>  <p>  Initial work on drafting a role profile for childminders and childminding network leaders and the features of a foundation training programme began prior to the launch of the National Action Plan, in the context of on-going work on developing a Workforce Development Plan for early learning and care and school-age childcare. In order to draft proposals, a working group was established specifically on childminding. The working group has strong representation of childminding views. Of its 12 members, six are childminders or work exclusively with or for childminders, while other members represent the views of parents, the statutory regulator (Tusla) and organisations which have provided extensive support for childminders. All decisions on the design and implementation of training programmes for childminders will be made by the Steering Group of the National Action Plan for Childminding.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan itself was based on extensive consultation and engagement with childminders, and the blueprint for the National Action Plan was the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which was coordinated and chaired by Childminding Ireland. The National Action Plan commits to further consultation with childminders, especially during Phase 1 of the Plan when developing regulations specific to childminders.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been engaging with the organisation in question on their specific concerns. While discussions are ongoing, I am hopeful that all relevant organisations that have a significant role in representing or supporting childminders will be actively involved in the oversight and advisory structures for the National Action Plan.</p></reply>

The reforms were designed to drive real and lasting change in the sector and address abuse of the immigration regime and labour market, improve the overall quality of educational offering to international students, and improve protection and supports for learners, whilst safeguarding the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers consistent with the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy. </p><p>The primary purpose of the Stamp 2 immigration permission is to enable non-EEA students to travel to Ireland to avail of educational opportunities and in the case of the sector in question, to study English. To pursue their studies, English language students can avail of up to three Stamp 2 immigration permissions, each of 8 months duration, to a maximum of two years.  As part of each 8 month permission, a student enrols on an English language programme which meets the requirements of the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), which is at least 25 weeks in duration and which provides a minimum of 15 classroom tuition hours per week led by an appropriately qualified teacher. The class attendance requirements linked to this permission are key to underpinning the integrity of English language provision.  </p><p>While primarily for the purpose of study, this permission also allows Stamp 2 holders to work while in the State subject to clearly stated conditions.  Students may take up employment which enables them to work up to 20 hours a week during term time and up to 40 hours a week during designated holiday periods. </p><p>Following the initial outbreak of Covid-19, it was recognised that English language students may be particularly vulnerable and face a distinct set of issues arising from the pandemic. These issues include a language barrier when accessing information, concerns surrounding their immigration conditions and the potential loss of employment.  In March 2020, my Department established a specific Working Group for the English language education (ELE) sector to address these issues. This group is comprised of the sectoral representatives of students, staff and providers alongside representatives of relevant Government Departments such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Protection. It has met 12 times to date.  </p><p>In the course of its work, this Working Group has published and enabled the dissemination of material for students to provide information on health advice, updates on new immigration measures as they have been introduced, and to advise them of their eligibility to apply for relevant social protection supports such as the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. In its engagements to date, the Working Group has also addressed questions surrounding access to Government services such as Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSNs) for students and clarified public health advice and supports for students who may reside in accommodation where social distancing and self-isolation may be challenging or not possible.  </p><p>In relation to the loss of employment, the key social protection measure that is available to ELE students is the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). The PUP was introduced by Government and made available to employees and the self-employed who lost their job on or after 13 March 2020.  ELE students and their representative bodies have been advised of the details of the PUP scheme alongside their eligibility to apply for it. In addition to the PUP, and in exceptional circumstances, ELE student have also been advised where they are experiencing a financial need that they cannot meet out of their weekly income they are also eligible to apply for the Exceptional Needs Payment which is available via the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Clarity surrounding the immigration permissions of ELE students has also been provided by the Department of Justice.  As the pandemic has developed and evolved, a number of updates in respect of the status of immigration permissions for International Students have been announced. The most recent update was provided in March 2021 announcing that relevant permissions are being automatically extended to 20 September 2021 including for English language students. The conditions attached to these renewed permissions are unchanged. Therefore, ELE students may take up or continue employment on the same basis as before.</p><p>Student welfare has been the key driver of my Department&rsquo;s response to the pandemic to date and my officials will continue to engage with ELE students representatives, via the ELE Working Group, to focus on student issues as this sector prepares to move towards the resumption of in-person activity, in line with public health guidelines, when it is safe to do so.</p><p>The planned establishment of the International Education Mark is intended to underpin a high quality ELE sector in Ireland that safeguards the interests of students and ensures that that the educational function of the ELE sector which is the teaching and learning of valuable English language proficiency is the mainstay of its future direction consistent with the objectives of the 2015 reforms.</p></reply>

The most recent announcement has extended relevant permissions until 20 September 2021. </p><p>The primary purpose of the Stamp 2 immigration permission is to enable non-EEA students to travel to Ireland to avail of educational opportunities and in the case of the sector in question, to study English. </p><p>In September 2014, a policy statement entitled &ldquo;Regulatory Reform of the International Education Sector and the Student Immigration Regime&rdquo; was launched jointly by the then Minister for Education and Skills and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The document contained a series of reforms considered necessary to address significant problems in part of Ireland&rsquo;s private college sector. During 2014, some 10 colleges closed their doors and over 3,000, mainly non-EEA, students were left without the education programmes for which they had paid. There were concerns as to the level of immigration abuse in the sector at that time, leading to the publication of .</p><p>On this basis, a series of reforms to the student immigration system for international education were implemented in 2015. The reforms were designed to drive real and lasting change in the sector and address abuse of the immigration regime and labour market, improve the overall quality of educational offering to international students, and improve protection and supports for learners, whilst safeguarding the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers consistent with the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy. One key reform was the introduction of the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), a more restrictive list of education programmes eligible for student immigration purposes.</p><p>Previously a student studying an English language programme of 25 weeks (375 hours tuition) was granted a full 12 months immigration permission. In 2015 it was agreed that this situation was no longer tenable and was regarded as contributing to some of the problems in the sector. Consequently, the general student permission for attending a 375 hour plus language programme was reduced to 8 months i.e. approximately 34-35 weeks. A non-EEA student can obtain up to three such Stamp 2 permissions studying English Language up to a maximum of two years.</p><p>This permission enables Stamp 2 holders to both study and work while in the State subject to the conditions of the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) Scheme.  Students may take up employment which enables them to work up to 20 hours a week during the traditional academic term and up to 40 hours a week during designated holiday periods. These holiday periods have been standardised as the 1st June to 31st September and the 15th December to 15th January of each year.  Therefore, under current conditions, ELE students who hold a Stamp 2 immigration permission can now work in Ireland for up to 40 hours per week until the end of September. </p><p>The Department understands from engagement with provider representatives that the majority of English language students enrol on 25 week programmes that predominately operate outside of the designated holiday periods therefore facilitating their ability to work fulltime over holiday periods. However, where students have enrolled on programmes scheduled during these periods, students are obliged to continue to meet their attendance requirements, aligned with conditions for ILEP.</p><p>The planned establishment of the International Education Mark is intended to underpin a high quality ELE sector in Ireland that safeguards the interests of students and ensures that that the educational function of the ELE sector which is the teaching and learning of valuable English language proficiency is the mainstay of its future direction consistent with the objectives of the 2015 reforms.</p></reply>

This comprises tuition fee funding via the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of almost 140,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution. In addition, over 60,000 students have all or part of the &euro;3,000 student contribution paid on their behalf under the Student Grant Scheme at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  This substantial funding support has played a very important role in enabling access to and growth in higher education in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of the future position, my Department's Statement of Strategy, which I published on 8 March last contains a commitment to put in place a sustainable funding model for higher education.  This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.    </p>  <p>  A comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options contained in the Cassells Review was commissioned by the European Commission and undertaken by independent expert consultants.  This review is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the completion of the funding review which will provide the basis for determining how best additional investment in higher education can meet future requirements, in particular in supporting access to higher education in terms of the totality of the costs of participation.  This is an essential to meeting a core objective of my mission as Minister is that everyone regardless of their background, age, gender, or address achieves their best potential.</p></reply>

This approach for on-site activity is consistent with small group learning across further, higher and adult education. To enable this to happen, all existing restrictions and public health guidance with appropriate protective measures and limited congregation will be followed supported by reopening protocols and an adaptation framework that are aligned with public health guidelines to facilitate and ensure the safe return to classroom activity for this cohort of students. The Working Group has worked collaboratively to develop these sectoral reopening protocols and supporting materials and this work is now nearing finalisation.   </p>  <p>  This approach notes the sector is much reduced with estimates placing student numbers at less than 10,000 currently in the State in comparison to pre-pandemic levels where the sector has capacity to facilitate approximately 200,000 foreign learners annually. </p>  <p>  Prospective ELE learners in the State not previously enrolled and students who are not currently in the country are not included in these planned on site activities.</p>  <p>  ELE providers have been advised that there remains no basis for the recruitment of new international students who might travel to the country at this time.

The proposed Higher Education Act 2021 will allow for strong internal governance of universities, technological universities and institutes of technology by reforming the size and composition of their governing bodies. Head 90 of the general scheme proposes amendment of Section 12 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 which provides for the membership of governing body of a technological university (TU). In order to support the objectives of the legislation to achieve effective and efficient governance, the governing bodies of TUs shall be significantly smaller than under current provisions. All external members are to be appointed using a skills based competency framework with consideration of experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the functions of the technological university to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the effective and efficient performance of those functions, or matters connected to education, teaching and learning, research, international perspectives, organisational and financial governance, management or public administration.</p>  <p>  While the proposed reforming provision does not reference Education and Training Board (ETB) membership of a TU governing body explicitly it will be open to ETB members to seek nomination to the governing bodies of TUs in accordance with the procedures for nomination which will be put in place.</p>  <p>  The reformed Higher Education Authority (HEA) legislation will provide for a co-regulation approach to governance such that each higher education institution (HEI) has primary responsibility for governance within an overall performance and regulatory framework including a clear accountability and reporting requirement to the HEA. This co-regulation model requires strong internal governance in HEIs. To secure strong internal governance, the governing bodies of HEIs should be of a size to allow for effective oversight.  As proposed membership shall be predominantly competency-based rather than representational and a strong external component to membership of governing bodies is required if they are to provide genuine accountability. This aligns with the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 which recommended that HEI governing authorities should have a smaller number of members, with the majority external members and membership should be competency based.</p>  <p>  In parallel with a move towards governing bodies that are smaller, more competency based and with a greater balance of external non-executive input, the legislation will seek to put in place effective consultation structures within HEIs and the higher education system to maintain a strong voice for stakeholders.</p></reply>

The following information sets out the legal position in this area. </p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 provides for the making of barring orders. The court may make a barring order to direct a respondent to either leave a place or to prevent them from entering a place where the applicant for the order or a dependant resides. Barring orders can remain in place for three years (or for a shorter period if the court so specifies). Before the expiration of that period another barring order can be made for a further period of up to three years.</p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act provides for the making of interim barring orders where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or a dependant, and the making of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect them.  An application for an interim barring order is made during the period after an application for a barring order has been made and before the application for the barring order has been determined. The court can make an interim barring order to direct a respondent to either leave a place or to prevent them from entering a place where the applicant or a dependant resides. An interim barring order may be made ex parte, in which case it shall have effect for a period not exceeding eight working days. An interim barring order shall cease to have effect once the application for a barring order has been determined.</p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Act provides for the making of emergency barring orders where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or a dependant. A person may apply for an emergency barring order where that person has lived in an intimate and committed relationship with the respondent without being their spouse or civil partner or where that person is the parent of an adult respondent. The applicant may apply for an emergency barring order if they have no legal or beneficial interest in the place or an interest which is less than the legal and beneficial interest of the respondent. The court can make an emergency barring order to direct a respondent to either leave a place or to prevent them from entering a place where the applicant or a dependant resides. An emergency barring order may be made ex parte and shall have effect for a period not exceeding eight working days. </p>  <p>  I must emphasise that it is for the court, which is independent in the exercising of its functions, to decide in each case if the barring order should be granted. </p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight that our laws in supporting victims of domestic and sexual crimes have been significantly strengthened in recent years, including by the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018. I can assure the Deputy that my Department is continually examining our laws in this area in the context of their effectiveness and to identify if any changes are required.</p></reply>

The coroner is an independent quasi-judicial office holder whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. This is an important public service to the living and in particular to the next-of-kin and friends of the deceased. Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved, but also perform a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns.</p>  <p>  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in assisting the coroner and in the carrying out of certain functions is set down in the coroner legislation. However, their obligations to investigate serious crimes, including where a death has occurred, is set down in the criminal law and is not a matter for the coroner. Access to an active crime scene must be strictly controlled where necessary for the investigation of the crime, as must access to any personal items or other materials that are relevant to the investigation. The conduct of any investigation is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, and as Minister I have no direct role in such matters.</p>  <p>  A Code of Practice for Families at Inquest as provided for under section 31 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is in final preparation. The Code has been agreed between IHREC, the Coroners Society of Ireland and my Department and will provide an extensive information resource and guidance for families. The Code will be put on a statutory basis by an Order to be made by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the Review of the Coroner Service published in December 2000, which was a significant milestone in the process of modernising our death investigation service, strengthening coroners&rsquo; powers and to provide for a major administrative restructuring of the coroner system. </p>  <p>  There are currently 39 Coronial Districts in Ireland, 38 of which are funded by the relevant local authority. My Department has taken on full responsibility for the Dublin Coroner Office from the Dublin local authorities since 1 January 2018. We have greatly increased the resources available to that Office, which is the busiest in the State and operates on a full time basis. The related Dublin District mortuary and post-mortem examination facilities for the Dublin Coroner, which are also available to the Office of State Pathologist have also been modernised and extra resources provided.  </p>  <p>  The majority of the recommendations of the 2000 Review related to the strengthening of the legal provisions relating to the work of the coroner and have been implemented, including through amendments to Coroners Act 1962 in 2005, 2011, 2013, 2019 and 2020 as follows:</p>  <p>  - The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005 ended the restriction on the number of medical witnesses allowed at inquest.</p>  <p>  - The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for the restructuring and amalgamation of coronial districts. Coroner districts within counties have been amalgamated as the opportunities have arisen. There were 48 districts in 2000, there are 39 now and will reduce to 38 within 2021.</p>  <p>  - The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for Legal Aid and Legal Advice by certification by the coroner to the Legal Aid Board in relation to inquests.</p>  <p>  - The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 clarified, strengthened and modernised coroner&rsquo;s powers in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths. The scope of enquiries at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death, to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Act also broadened the coroner&rsquo;s powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquest into maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations and significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest.</p>  <p>  - The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2021 made provision for the temporary additional coronial resources to coroners in districts significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The structure and resourcing of the Coronial Service will continue to be reviewed and revised as appropriate in the context of the learning from the pandemic.</p></reply>

There has also been ongoing correspondence and dialogue between the two parties. </p>  <p>  Draft legislation is currently being prepared by the Department and contains provisions for appropriate compensation under various income loss headings for the small number of operators affected.

The details of the legislation, and the proposed compensation scheme will be presented before the Oireachtas in due course.</p>  <p>  Whilst COVID-19 brought about a renewed focus on fur farming, the primary reason for its prohibition is animal welfare related.  While fur farming was once legal and socially acceptable in most countries, societal understanding of animal welfare has developed significantly and there is now a broad consensus among veterinary and other scientific experts that certain animals should not be farmed solely for their fur or skin.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-16a.645.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061600088#WRM04300"><p>The increased shift to remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has given us the opportunity for a greater regional distribution of jobs and to support a better quality of life for many people who previously spent many hours in long commutes. This is a key focus of the Government's new rural development policy <i>Our Rural Future.</i></p><p>Remote working, supported by appropriate infrastructure and facilities, has the potential to encourage more people to live in rural areas while working in good quality jobs, no matter where their employer is based. It can also help revitalise our rural town if remote working hubs are developed in their centres.</p><p>The National Hub Network expanded from a &euro;1m scheme that was funded under the 2019 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan. This project was originally scoped to develop a hub network, supported by a shared online platform for remote working facilities in the Atlantic Economic Corridor. However, in light of the clear demand for such a network across the county, this was expanded to a national project that would support both <i>Our Rural Future</i>and the National Remote Working strategy.</p><p>To support this expansion I have provided the Western Development Commission with additional funding to support the project, with &euro;250k being provided to develop connnectedhubs.ie as a national brand, which I launched on May 31 in Swinford, Co. Mayo. This money will also fund a national awareness raising campaign for the hub network.  </p><p>In addition, I have committed to funding the on-boarding and operational costs of the connectedhubs.ie platform for hubs across the country for the next 3 years. This is expected to cost in the region of &euro;1.3m.</p><p>The National Hub Network, supported by connectedhubs.ie will work to increase the impact and benefit of our remote working infrastructure across the country. This will help to guide future funding decisions and to increase the return-on-investment to the exchequer going forward.</p><p>My Department also continues to invest significantly in the development of new Hub facilities across the country. Since 2015, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme has provided &euro;7.8m in funding to hubs and hub-related projects. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs. </p><p>I recently announced funding of &euro;15 million that is available under the 2021 Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS). In line with <i>Our Rural Future</i>, a key focus of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to renovate derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres, and specifically supports bringing vacant properties in town centres back into use or re-purpose existing community or publicly owned buildings as remote working hubs. </p><p>I have increased the maximum grant available under this Scheme to &euro;500,000 to permit projects of significant scale to be funded. The TVRS It is administered by Local Authorities, who are currently seeking expressions of interest for suitable projects from local groups in towns and villages within their respective counties. The closing date set for receipt of completed applications by my Department is 16 July. </p><p>In addition to funding through the Town and Village Scheme, &euro;65m has also been invested in hub projects through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund since 2018. A further call for projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will issue later this year.</p></reply>

PPNs were established following the enactment of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged Mazars consultants to carry out an independent review of PPN structures, which is currently underway after a competitive procurement process. The final cost of the review will be published, as appropriate, when the process is completed. The review will consider whether the current structures in place are supporting PPNs in meeting their objectives. Its aim is to ensure that PPNs continue to be fit for purpose and to make recommendations that will support their ongoing development. </p>  <p>  Such a review is regarded by my Department as timely given the length of time since PPNs were established. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to &ldquo;carry out a comprehensive review of PPNs and LECPs to ensure they are fit for purpose for climate action and community development&rdquo;.  The final review report is expected to be complete by end 2021.</p></reply>

The Programme provides funding to community groups and organisations across Ireland, with a focus on areas of disadvantage.  Funding is provided to each Local Authority area, and the programme is administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDC) on the basis of local need.  </p>  <p>  Between 2018 and the end of 2020 the CEP funded over 8,000 projects across the country.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2021 CEP on the 10th May with an allocation of &euro;4.5m.  The key theme of this year&rsquo;s programme is supporting groups as they their re-open facilities which were closed due to COVID-19.  In order to allow flexibility, each LCDC can set their own closing date to best suit its area, but all closing dates must be no later than 16th July 2021. Groups should check with their LCDC for further details. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present for another call for funding that is specifically for community centres under the CEP in 2021. However, groups involved with community centres, like all other community groups, can apply for funding under the CEP that was recently launched.</p></reply>
