The Office of Public Works are responsible for the delivery of the necessary infrastructure and in preparation for the no-deal scenario, temporary facilities were installed in Rosslare Harbour including public office facilities, basic driver comfort facilities and exam areas for SPS and Customs controls. OPW are currently working to ensure that permanent facilities will be in place by 1 January 2021. </p>  <p>  As regards staffing and resources, I am advised that Revenue appointed over 400 additional staff nationally to customs and related roles for Brexit in the period September 2018 to 12 April 2019. 30 of these additional 400 staff were assigned to Rosslare Europort. These additional staff brought the total Revenue staff in Rosslare Europort to approximately 50.  In order to facilitate trade, Revenue will operate extended opening hours to suit current trade flows.</p>  <p>  Revenue has engaged directly with trade and business to provide advice and support in relation to the changes that will occur as a result of Brexit. On 30 January, Revenue, together with Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, hosted a Customs Brexit Information seminar in Wexford town. This was part of an ongoing and extensive trader engagement program highlighting the Brexit-related Revenue supports and providing an opportunity for traders to speak directly with experts across a range of specific Customs themes as well as from other Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  On 5 April 2019, Revenue commenced direct engagement with truck drivers at both Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort. Customs Officers provided advice to drivers waiting to embark ferries and on-board a number of sailings. Information leaflets, providing key customs advice for truck drivers were  distributed to ensure that drivers understand and are aware of the impact Brexit will have on their journeys.  </p>  <p>  On 8 April 2019, Revenue gave a presentation in Rosslare Europort to the haulage sector outlining the Customs procedures and obligations in relation to the flow of goods through Rosslare Europort.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-17a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041700059#WRB01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 98 together.</p>  <p>  Our economy continues to grow at a robust pace, with GDP growth of 6.7 per cent in 2018. As a result, Ireland continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. I would like to stress that while the headline GDP figure can be exaggerated in an Irish context, other indicators such as consumer spending, modified domestic demand, along with taxation receipts confirm the robust growth in our economy. </p>  <p>  Our economic health is most clearly evident in the labour market with more people working in Ireland than ever before (2.28 million) and the unemployment rate is now significantly below that of other Euro Area countries. The outlook for the economy remains positive over the coming years, with modified domestic demand, a more meaningful measure of underlying economic activity in Ireland, is set to expand by 4.0 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year.</p>  <p>  The strength of our economy, in part, reflects the important steps we have taken to improve our competitiveness. Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent.  </p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. However we cannot become complacent. As the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) highlighted in its recent report, there remains a number of bottlenecks at a sectorial level which impact on Ireland's cost competitiveness.   </p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For 2018 as a whole, Ireland&rsquo;s inflation averaged just 0.7 per cent, this compares to an average inflation rate of 1.9 per cent for the EU as a whole. The comparatively low level of inflation in Ireland should help to maintain our competitiveness and protect real wage growth. </p>  <p>  On wage developments, while average hourly earnings grew at 3 per cent in 2018, a noticeable increase on the growth rate of 1.7 per cent recorded in 2017, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, which may undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness relative to other European countries. </p>  <p>  Despite the positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for housing and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.</p></reply>

I last answered it in Dail myself in mid February this year (PQ 1750/19) and my colleague Minister English also answered a similar question at his oral Parliamentary Questions last week. Each time it has clearly been stated that the Government is not, and has never committed to, establishing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) on behalf of the organisation mentioned in the details supplied.  </p>  <p>  At present I am not aware of any legal or regulatory barriers to the organisation mentioned establishing its own SPV to invest social housing through Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  </p>  <p>  Since 2015, there has been extensive engagement from my Department and the Department of Housing with this organisation. Following analysis of their two proposals and meetings with the organisation in question, both Departments stated in writing that the second of the proposed models &ndash; the establishment of an SPV by credit unions &ndash; was the most suitable.</p>  <p>  In July 2016, Rebuilding Ireland separately committed to establishing an Innovation Fund to support the development of innovative financial models, such as SPVs, by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  It has been repeatedly clarified both in writing and indeed in answers to Parliamentary Questions that this commitment was not to establish a state owned SPV, rather to provide funding to help develop a sector-led AHB SPV. </p>  <p>  In relation to supporting Credit Unions in the provision of funding for social housing, the role of the Government and the Central Bank is to ensure there are is an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework. In this regard, the Central Bank revised the Credit Union Investment Regulations in March 2018 to enable credit unions to invest in social housing via an SPV. </p>  <p>  As such the Government and the Central Bank have fulfilled their role and it is now up to both the credit union and social housing sectors themselves to progress and develop any specific funding mechanisms. </p>  <p>  I am aware that one of the Credit Union representative bodies has completed all of the preparatory work for establishing an SPV but is awaiting a minimum level of projects to justify the costs of establishing the SPV. I have not been made aware of progress made by the organisation referred to in establishing such an SPV.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-17a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041700059#WRB02200"><p>I am aware of recently expressed concerns to which the Deputy refers, in relation to the potential effect investors adopting the 'buy to rent' model are having on the Irish property market.</p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis, and has recently published a paper on Institutional Investment in the Housing Market. The paper is based on CSO data up to 2017, the latest year available. </p>  <p>  While there is a perception that institutional investors are purchasing large amounts of housing stock, the data show that their activity has been limited in the context of the overall housing market.  In 2017 &mdash; the latest year for which we have data &ndash; firms in this category were net purchasers of just 1 per cent of residential sales, or just over 500 units. Furthermore, from 2010 to 2017, net purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate funds and private equity firms were less than 0.01 per cent of available units, or just 380 units.</p>  <p>  In relation to the tax treatment of such entities, the function of the REIT framework for example, is not to provide an overall tax exemption. It is to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are required to distribute 85% of their property profits each year for taxation at the level of the shareholder and Dividend Withholding Tax is collected on the distributions. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime was introduced in Finance Act 2016 as a result of concerns raised in both the media and the D&aacute;il regarding the activities of certain non-resident investors in the Irish property market. These provisions apply to certain investment funds deriving 25% or more of their value from Irish real estate assets and impose a Dividend Withholding Tax on distributions to non-resident investors.</p>  <p>  I currently have no plans to change the aforementioned treatment of such entities, however, as the Deputy will be aware, as part of the 2018 Finance Bill process I committed that my officials would undertake a report of the impact of REITs, IREFs and Section 110 companies on the residential property market. This report to be presented to the Tax Strategy Group this summer, and work is ongoing in this regard.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-17a.26.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041700059#WRB02400"><p><i>54.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance when measures will be introduced to ensure insurance companies cannot refuse insurance in locations in which flood defence measures have been introduced. <b>[10612/19]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-17a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041700059#WRB02500"><p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management ("CFRAM") Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment ("AFAs") including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway. The Plans also provide the outline of 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties and the evidence to prioritise their delivery to where its benefit is greatest. OPW have informed us that they and Local Authorities will work closely together on the all of the projects to ensure that they are all implemented in the lifetime of the Programme.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to believe that its existing policy and investment in relation to flooding which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme by the OPW and Local Authorities, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes.  </p>  <p>  The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey in March 2019 of approximately 87% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 95% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 74% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover. It should be noted that my Department is continuing to actively examine what can be done to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences.</p></reply>

As the market developed this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products.  However, it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. </p>  <p>  After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. The Deputy referred to the example of the change in the VAT treatment of herbal teas. The change in that instance was affected by amending the VAT Consolidation Act by way of an amendment in Finance Act 2014. Following the consultation process that is planned I will consider if an amendment concerning food supplements is necessary.</p>  <p>  I have committed to putting in place a consultation process to help me identify the policy options in relation to VAT on food supplements and will publish the conclusions in the Tax Strategy Papers later this year. I envisage seeking input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, to ensure that any legislative changes I bring forward are evidence based, and I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Health in this regard.</p>  <p>  Details on the public consultation will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

The Commission of Investigation is under the remit of the Department of Taoiseach and the former Minister for Finance and Department of Finance Officials are the subject of one of the terms of reference. Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to comment extensively. The Commission's terms of reference and interim report are available on the Merrion Street website. Neither call for a suspension of NAMA's activities. The Commission's final report is scheduled to be published by the end June 2019.</p>  <p>It is important to note that in no way has the integrity of NAMA or the NAMA Board or the integrity of its decisions been brought into question in relation to the disposal of Project Eagle. I therefore have no intention of directing NAMA to halt its activities. To do so would irreparably damage NAMA's positive contribution to our recovery and damage our reputation as a credible, open and transparent market. By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The decision of the Oireachtas in 2009 to allow NAMA to carry out its functions in an independent manner has been vindicated by its strong performance since inception. In October 2017 it eliminated the Irish taxpayers' contingent liability of &euro;30 billion which arose from the senior debt issued in order to acquire bank loan portfolios.  NAMA also expects to redeem its subordinated debt by March 2020 and to produce a surplus &ndash; currently estimated at &euro;3.5 billion &ndash; by the time it completes its work subject to continued positive market performance.</p>  <p>  Halting NAMA&rsquo;s activities would put these achievements at risk. It would entail the State taking direct control of NAMA and bring NAMA onto the State&rsquo;s balance sheet. Such action also would raise serious competition concerns limiting the State&rsquo;s flexibility in recovering value from NAMA&rsquo;s remaining assets.  Such action would also create significant challenges for NAMA in retaining staff and preserving a viable platform to maximise the return from its remaining assets.</p></reply>

In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately being borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  In the course of last year's Finance Bill process, I acknowledged that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. At the time I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p>  <p>  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters in their pricing decisions. Betting duty will be given further consideration in the next budget and in that context my decision will be informed by the outcome of the review into the alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector as well as the other considerations which I have set out.</p></reply>

In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as play centres where because of these aforementioned factors, insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive. </p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report which concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  </p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he hopes to have this Bill enacted by the summer.  In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.</p></reply>

Furthermore under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale. </p>  <p>  However, while the legislative framework has been expanded to include the regulation of both loan owners and credit servicing, regulated lenders (or credit servicing firms) are entitled to make certain commercial decisions in relation to non performing loans whilst adhering to all the relevant consumer protection regulation that is in place.</p>  <p>  The specific legislation and regulation of receivership would fall under the aegis of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation who would be better placed to comment on and provide information on this topic.</p>  <p>  With regard to the "state owned" banks or, more accurately, those in which the State has a majority shareholding, their corporate strategies and decisions are the responsibility of the boards and management and the firms must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents which I as Minister, cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  That being said my officials received the following response from AIB:</p>  <p>  "AIB continues to seek engagement with all borrowers in difficulty and only appoints Receivers when all other avenues have been exhausted.

The terms of reference required that in conducting the review the review group was to have regard to the principle of achieving relative stability in the LPT payments of those liable for the tax and provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020. </p>  <p>  The review group was asked to look in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments since the original valuation date of 1st May 2013. The review also included an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.  A public consultation process was conducted as part of the review to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT. </p>  <p>  The review focused on the impact of house price movements under a series of scenarios involving different rate and tax band structures. However, against a background of significant but geographically uneven increases in residential property price levels, I believe it is necessary to engage in further consultation in order to identify a scenario that would deliver on the condition I set that there should be relative stability for all taxpayers in their LPT liabilities and that any increases should be modest and affordable.</p>  <p>  Having considered the findings of the review report, and as I announced on the 2nd of April, I have therefore decided to defer the valuation date from 1st November 2019 to 1st November 2020 and to submit the report to the Budget Oversight Committee (BOC) in the context of the  recommendations in its report on LPT of 21 March 2018. The deferral of revaluation until November 2020 provides time and space for the BOC to consider the report of the inter-departmental review and to provide its views to me. Importantly, as a result of my decision, the LPT bills of those liable for the tax will not be increasing in 2020.</p></reply>

This represents a small shortfall of just 3.3 per cent or &euro;171 million. However, it should be noted that income tax is a broadly based tax-head, covering a range of sub-components. In the year to end-March there was some weakness recorded in receipts derived from unearned sources of income, and early Schedule D tax payments. However, it should be noted that PAYE income tax receipts which account for about 70 per cent of the overall annual target finished the quarter broadly in line with collection targets which reflects the continuation of positive labour market developments. Separately, USC posted a similar performance. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would caution against drawing any conclusions for the year&rsquo;s performance with just one quarter of data.

The result of this is that in certain parts of the economy such as play centres, insurers are withdrawing altogether as they argue they are incurring losses in these areas </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products.  However it was recognised that the State could play a role in improving the environment within which insurers operate, thus explaining why the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016.</p>  <p>  The CIWG has produced two reports and a series of quarterly progress updates on the various recommendations made by CIWG and endorsed by Government.  The difficulties facing the consumer, voluntary and small business sector from the high cost of insurance premiums are acknowledged in these reports. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the CIWG was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) which was asked to examine amongst other things award levels in this country compared with elsewhere.  The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum. </p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he intends having it enacted by the summer.  In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the investigation of insurance fraud by the Garda&iacute;, Minister of State D'Arcy has been in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner. The Minister of State has been  assured by the Commissioner that he is working to increase Garda capacity in this area and a public announcement is expected on this matter in the next couple of weeks.  </p>  <p>  I expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing of premiums in general will take account of the measures which have been, and are being, implemented as a result of the CIWG recommendations more broadly and I believe that insurers themselves recognise this.  In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  A further public statement by insurers to this effect would assist in efforts to continue the necessary reform.</p>  <p>  Finally, it has been suggested that the provision of support packages to businesses like play centres to protect the businesses and the jobs of persons working in them should be considered.  However, this would amount to the State in effect becoming an insurance provider. Such a step would likely be in breach of the Solvency II Directive and as it would involve the State providing preferential support to one part of the economy over another, it would run the risk of being consider State Aid and contrary to EU State Aid rules.  In addition, if a package of Government support, contained or otherwise available more generally to businesses, was put in place, it is also likely that such a measure could result ultimately in insurers withdrawing from large parts of the overall market.  This would end up being counter-productive and bad for such small businesses in the longer term.</p></reply>

Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p>  <p>  Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance provide more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.  The eighth quarterly update was published in March and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Alongside delivering fairer premiums for consumers, a key objective of the Working Group is to create a more competitive insurance market overall in this country.  I believe that the full implementation of all of the recommendations will make Ireland more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing capacity as well as competition.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the nature of the EU Single Market is such that insurance undertakings authorised in other member states are allowed conduct business in the Irish market on either a freedom of service basis or a freedom of establishment basis, consequently there are no restrictions preventing such companies entering this market if they wish.  You should also be aware that Recommendation 5 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance called for the Department to support efforts and raise awareness of the need to improve cross-border insurance at EU level.  Accordingly, the Department is monitoring developments at EU level on an ongoing basis and is for instance actively participating in the current Motor Insurance Directive amendment proposal. </p></reply>

The estimated increased  Exchequer yield arising from this Budget change is &euro;466 million in 2019. In terms of composition, the VAT rate increase in tourist accommodation is expected to yield &euro;235 million, restaurants &euro;191 million; hairdressing &euro;27 million; bloodstock sales &euro;7 million and cinemas and shows &euro;6 million.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking VAT is paid in arrears every second month with relatively insignificant receipts in the &lsquo;off&rsquo; months. The January 2019 VAT receipts were primarily related to the November/December trading period, under which the old rate of 9 per cent would have applied to such tourism-related activity.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recent March collection which mainly relates to the January/February trading period would have been the first under the new 13.5 per cent rate. In year-on-year terms monthly receipts were up by 9.0 per cent or &euro;173 million. However, data is not available on what proportion of this relates to the rate increase or specifically the tourism sector. </p></reply>

In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler and their family bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems with such costs ultimately being borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  In the course of last year's Finance Bill process, I acknowledged that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. At the time I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p>  <p>  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters in their pricing decisions. Betting duty will be given further consideration in the next budget and in that context my decision will be informed by the outcome of the review into the alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector as well as the other considerations which I have set out.</p></reply>

This has fallen from 40% in the initial survey in 2011 to the current level of 20% in the most recent survey, covering the period October to March 2018.</p>  <p>  In respect of the issue of the high interest rates charged to SMEs by the Deputy, I, as Minister for Finance, have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers.   I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions as these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to product interest rates as determined by the banks from time to time.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, only 1% of SMEs that did not seek credit stated it was due to it being too expensive to borrow. The same survey notes that four in ten of all SMEs with outstanding debt are not certain of the interest rate attached to their outstanding loans. Of those that are aware, the average cost of credit reported on outstanding loans is 4.4%, down from 5.1% in September 2017.</p></reply>

Individual landlords are subject to income tax on all their income combined, at the applicable rates, including USC and PRSI where appropriate. </p>  <p>  Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&lsquo;relief for certain income from leasing of farm land&rsquo;) provides for the exemption of certain income from the leasing of farm land, where the land is let under a qualifying lease. This particular relief was designed to encourage longer term leases of farm land, with the targeted policy objective of assisting with the mobility and productive use of agricultural land. </p>  <p>  When considering the introduction of any tax expenditure measure, my officials undertake an evaluation of the proposal in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. An evaluation will seek to address issues such as identification of the market failure, the policy rationale for intervention, cost, and whether a tax based measure is the most efficient form of intervention. With regard to the latter point, in many cases a market failure may be more appropriately remedied by a direct expenditure measure or through regulation. Other considerations include the potential for deadweight costs, the potential cost of the tax revenue foregone to the Exchequer and the scope for abuse. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention. I must be mindful of the many demands on the Exchequer and the need to maintain a broad base of taxation.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in Finance Act 2018, and with effect from 1 January 2019, I provided for the full restoration of the amount of interest that may be deducted by landlords in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair their residential property, as a means to support the rental sector.</p></reply>

I would like to advise the Deputy that I signed the regulations and commencement order that give effect to the 2018 changes on the 27th of March.</p>  <p>  One of the most significant changes I made relates to the potential for inflated claims. Production companies are now required to apply for payment of the tax credit under the self-assessment system.  This brings the operation of the credit within the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for incorrect claims.</p>  <p>  In relation to training, I legislated to split the certification process between Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (DCHG). Production companies are now required to apply to the DCHG before commencement of main production to have the film certified as a qualifying film. This provides an opportunity for earlier engagement on the training requirements associated with the credit and the quality of training intended to be provided.</p>  <p>  Applicants must now provide a skills development plan if the amount to be spent on making the film in Ireland is over &euro;2m, that plan must be agreed with Screen Ireland.  There must be a skills development participant for every &euro;177,500 of tax credit claimed, up to a maximum of 8 such participants.  A post project skills development report is required for each project.</p>  <p>  In relation to quality employment, as I have previously stated, the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation through the Workplace Relations Commission, which falls within that Department&rsquo;s remit.  However, as part of the new certification process to be undertaken by DCHG, an applicant company is required to sign an undertaking of compliance with all relevant employment legislation. This undertaking is required to be signed and furnished with every section 481 application.</p>  <p>  If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including compliance with the undertaking, they are not eligible for the corporation tax credit.  Any amount already claimed will be recoverable, with interest.  As the claim for tax relief is made by the producer on a self assessment basis, in each case consideration would have to be given to Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions to determine whether or not penalties and publication may arise. </p>  <p>  In relation to numbers employed within the Industry, the Revenue Commissioners, from section 481 applications in 2016, estimate the number of employees directly engaged in Section 481 productions to be 2,158 (full time equivalents).  My Department in carrying out the Section 481 cost benefit analysis in 2018 estimated that there were a further 902 indirect employments giving a total of 3,060 full time equivalents associated with Section 481 projects in that year.  It must be emphasised that these figures relate specifically to projects in receipt of the section 481 tax credit, whereas some other figures quoted refer to the wider audio-visual and radio sector.</p></reply>

Article 284 of the Directive permits Ireland to maintain two thresholds - &euro;75,000 for goods and &euro;37,500 for services.</p>  <p>  Different VAT registration thresholds for the supply of goods and services are a feature of the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation and reflect the profound difference between the two supplies. In general, the value added in relation to the supply of goods will be much smaller relative to turnover compared with a supply of services. Having a lower VAT registration threshold for services reflects this difference in the proportion of value-added.</p></reply>

A first group of proposals advocate the need to reallocate a proportion of profits, and thus taxation rights, towards different concepts of value creation, including the value generated by having a presence in a market jurisdiction. The second group of proposals are asking whether there are remaining concerns about base erosion and profit shifting that should be addressed by common global minimum taxation rules.</p>  <p>  A public consultation was held by the OECD in March which provided an opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to the debate. There was considerable interest in the public consultation with approximately 250 responses received by the OECD.  A detailed work plan is now being developed by the OECD to be brought before the BEPS Inclusive Framework in May 2019 for agreement. This in turn will be presented to G20 Finance Ministers in June 2019 for approval.  It is expected that this workplan will request that the OECD's technical Working Groups further develop the proposals over the next 18 months with a view to reaching final agreement by end 2020.  </p>  <p>  I have consistently recognised that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  I remain convinced that the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework, where over 120 countries work together on an equal footing, is the correct forum for this work to be carried out.  </p>  <p>  There are a variety of views at the OECD table and the eventual outcome will need to strike a balance to reflect these differing interests.  It is in Ireland's interest that an agreement is eventually reached to ensure the continuation of a stable, consensus based international tax framework which is vital to facilitate cross-border trade and investment.</p></reply>

As the UK Government and other research institutes have assessed, Brexit will have a negative economic impact on the UK economy and the Northern Ireland economy in particular. The all-island economy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  In terms of the joint ESRI and Department of Finance research, a range of alternative scenarios were considered given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The study finds that, compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland ten years after Brexit would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a Deal scenario and 5.0 per cent lower in a Disorderly No-Deal scenario respectively. This assessment shows that all Brexit scenarios will imply a slower pace of growth with negative consequences throughout the economy.</p>  <p>  This slower growth will have a negative impact on the labour market. Employment is still forecast to continue growing &ndash; but at a slower pace than would be the case under a no Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  The general government balance would worsen by an average of &frac12; a percentage point of GDP over the medium-term, and by nearly 1 per cent over the long-term, in the disorderly no-deal Brexit scenario. The deterioration in the fiscal balance would be structural, not cyclical in nature. This would reflect a permanent reduction in the size of the economy and consequently in the amount of tax revenue it generates.  The implications of this will be considered as part of the Budgetary cycle.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average.</p>  <p>  The Government has also taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  We will continue to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Following the most recent round of consultations by the two Governments with the parties on 15 February, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution. However, I continue to believe that this can be achieved and there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the difficulties that have arisen in relation to the UK exit from the European Union and getting the Withdrawal Agreement ratified by the UK, has predominated in recent weeks. However, the Government has always strongly argued that the challenges raised by the UK exit must not stand in the way of getting all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement up and working again. Indeed, the challenges raised by the UK exit from the European Union for the island of Ireland are further profound and compelling reasons for the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the North South Ministerial Council to be operating on behalf of citizens, and in accordance with their respective mandates under the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  Both Governments remain determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions of the Agreement operating again.  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties, to get the necessary political process underway to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly and North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

Given this position, banking regulators have tasked each bank with developing and implementing strategies with the expectation that their ratios will be reduced towards the European average. Despite the significant number of restructures undertaken, given the sale of reduction required, it was inevitable though unfortunate, that loan sales would be required.</p>  <p>  I should highlight for the Deputy that in my role as Minister for Finance, I cannot stop loan sales even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard, as well as the criteria used to decide the make-up of loans to be included, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale, either by way of securitisation or otherwise, remain unchanged. Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in terms of overdrafts being converted into a loan facility and transferred to a Retail Credit Firm, customers have the right to appeal the withdrawal of any undrawn funds (from the overdraft facility) to the Credit Review Office (CRO). The CRO is able to review cases where credit facilities up to &euro;3m are refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions. Details of how to appeal to the CRO can be found on the website www.creditreview.ie. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that the banks' independence in these matters is protected as previously discussed, officials from my department contacted AIB and it provided the following response:</p>  <p>  "As is standard for a portfolio sales process, it is a requirement to withdraw overdraft facilities and convert  these  facilities into term loans.   Please see detailed below the process and infrastructure in place to support overdraft customers as they transition to Everyday DAC:</p>  <p>  - "Customers included in the portfolio sale, with an overdraft facility, have been issued with a letter providing notification of the withdrawal of the overdraft facility. As part of this notification, customers have been advised that they can utilise the full facility, including accessing available funds, throughout the notification period which will be 65 days. This provides customers with the option of availing of the full credit facility ahead of the withdrawal date.</p>  <p>  - "Customers have also been advised that they can retain working current a/c&rsquo;s (which must be maintained in a credit position) post closure of sale. This means customers can retain their bank a/c&rsquo;s and there is no impact from an operational perspective in terms of physical movement of a/c&rsquo;s, debits etc.</p>  <p>  - "At the end of the notification period, the drawn balance will transfer with other Loans to Everyday Finance DAC. Any overdraft facilities with a &euro;0 or credit balance will not transfer and will remain with AIB operating as a current/credit account.</p>  <p>  - "As outlined in the notification letter, SME customers have the right to appeal the withdrawal of credit and the appeal will be heard in line with the current independent SME/Credit Review Office appeals process."</p></reply>

In fact, in February of this year my Department published a paper tilted &lsquo;Institutional Investment in the Housing Market&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The paper describes how ownership of rental properties by large scale landlords - those that own more than 100 rental units - accounted for less than five per cent of all tenancies nationally. In 2017, the latest year for which data is available, the combined property purchasing activity of property funds, real estate companies and REITs accounted for a net one per cent of transactions. </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office is due to publish updated data on the market activity of all non-household buyers in the summer. Publication of this data will allow further analysis of the impact of institutional investors such as venture capital companies.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary response to mitigating residential price inflation is to increase supply. I understand that in 2019, the vast majority of investments made by institutional investors will be via &lsquo;forward commit&rsquo; deals i.e. the funding or forward purchasing of yet-to-be-built stock. This is a very positive development in terms of boosting supply, particularly as the focus of most institutional investors is on the construction of apartments. As the National Planning Framework sets out, Ireland needs to increase the density of its housing stock if we are to meet our sustainability goals.</p>  <p>  In relation to prices, the increased presence of institutional investors has coincided with a significant deceleration in home price inflation. As of February 2019, annual residential price inflation was 4.3 per cent, substantially down from 12.5 per cent in the same month last year.</p></reply>

The extension includes giving the UK flexibility to leave before that date should the Withdrawal Agreement be ratified.  </p><p>The European Council decision made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be re-negotiated and that any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement. We welcome these important assertions.  </p><p>If the UK stays in the EU beyond 22 May and holds EP elections, it will continue to be a full EU Member State. We welcome the UK&rsquo;s commitment to act in a responsible and constructive way during the extension. This is important to safeguard the effective functioning of the EU as we make decisions on our future and for our citizens, and the EU27 can therefore discuss matters related to long term decisions without the UK. </p><p>The European Council also agreed that should the UK&rsquo;s position on the EU-UK future relationship evolve, the EU is prepared to reconsider the political declaration on the future relationship.</p><p>The Government remains focused on the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement as the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the European Council provides the UK with more time, until 31 October, to ensure an orderly withdrawal, however while it means that the immediate risk of a no deal Brexit has receded it has not been fully averted. The preparations, that have been taking place since before the Brexit referendum took place for all possible scenarios are therefore continuing. Brexit in all scenarios will have negative consequences and as a Government we are determined to be as ready as we can be. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018, sets out comprehensive, cross-Government preparations that have been taking place since even before the referendum. The Government has been taking key decisions to advance the implementation of our Brexit preparations. </p><p>This includes the preparation of Brexit related legislation, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, which has completed all Oireachtas stages and was signed into law by the President on 17 March. </p><p>The Act complements legal measures at EU level and focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.  It makes provisions for continued access to healthcare, social security protection, student support and justice and security measures. The Act is primarily intended for a no deal scenario, and most of the Act will not be commenced should the Withdrawal agreement be ratified. </p><p>The legislation which I proposed in the areas of Taxation and Financial Services is an important part of the whole of Government response to Brexit, as it will ensure continuity of access for business and citizens in relation to certain taxation reliefs and allowances, as well as enabling insurance undertakings to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers, in a no deal scenario.  </p><p>The Government has also taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure.</p><p>As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. I am satisfied that my Department and its relevant agencies will continue to work to ensure that they are as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, post Brexit. </p><p>As a Government we will continue to strongly encourage businesses and citizens to do the same. For instance businesses that trade with the UK should apply now to the Revenue Commission for their customs number (EORI). The Government website <i>gov.ie/brexit</i>is an important resource in this regard and contains information on a range of Brexit supports and advice, as well as an overview of the institutions offering financial assistance to businesses such as the SBCI, microfinance Ireland, Intertrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

This rate is applied to a broad base with limited deductions &ndash; a policy which is endorsed by the likes of the OECD as it is good for growth in our economy.</p>  <p>  Our competitive corporation tax regime has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then, bringing real jobs and investment into Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The value of a stable and consistent approach to corporation tax policy, both for the business community and for the Exchequer, has long been recognised. The cornerstone of this policy is the long-term and continuing commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been criticised for the way in which our tax system has been used by multinationals in their aggressive tax planning structures to exploit mismatches between the tax systems of various countries and gaps in the international tax framework. In defending our domestic tax system I recognise the importance of ensuring effective taxation of multinational companies and the need for internationally agreed solutions to counter aggressive tax planning.  For this reason Ireland has been, and continues to be, fully engaged with international efforts to counter aggressive tax planning, through both the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) project and the co-ordinated action at EU level. </p>  <p>  In September 2018, I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, marking another milestone in Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing work on corporation tax reform.  It lays out the next steps in implementing the various commitments we have made through the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, the BEPS reports and the recommendations set out in the Coffey Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code.  </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage in the OECD on ongoing international tax reform and recognises that further change to the international tax framework is necessary. I am supportive of the further examination of proposals currently being discussed via the OECD Inclusive Framework and the aim of reaching a global consensus. In these discussions it is Ireland&rsquo;s view that any changes must not disproportionately prejudice small open economies and any agreed outcome must be long-term, sustainable and above all fair.</p>  <p>  In all of this we will continue to foster economic activity in Ireland, the EU and beyond by adapting and evolving our corporate tax regime, while maintaining our key 12.5% rate, and ensuring that we continue to have a regime that is transparent, sustainable and legitimate.</p></reply>

These are numerous and primarily external in nature. </p>  <p>  First and foremost is the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Joint research by the ESRI and my Department has shown the impact that a disorderly Brexit could have for the economy. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further disruption to trade or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy, and a stylised model based assessment of the impact of a shock to world growth is provided in the Stability Programme.</p>  <p>  On the domestic front, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment, and the concentrated nature of Ireland's production base.</p>  <p>  The best way that we can mitigate against these risks however is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, and this is what this Government continues to do.</p></reply>

In that regard, a key recommendation of the CIWG was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) which was asked to examine amongst other things award levels in this country compared with elsewhere.  The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum. </p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he hopes to have the legislation enacted by the summer.  In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.</p>  <p>  Finally, I expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing of premiums in general will take account of the measures which have been, and are being, implemented as a result of the CIWG recommendations more broadly and I believe that insurers themselves recognise this.  In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  A further public statement by insurers to this effect would assist in efforts to continue the necessary reform.</p></reply>

However, over the last number of months uncertainty in the external environment has increased substantially.  The pace of growth has slowed in Ireland's key export markets, with a loss of momentum particularly evident in both the euro area and the UK. Accordingly the Department of Finance has revised down its forecast, relative to Budget 2019, for GDP by a quarter of a percentage point this year and next.</p>  <p>  As published in the Stability Programme Update for 2019, my Department is forecasting GDP growth of 3.9 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year. Over the medium term, GDP is expected to at around 2 1/2 per cent, with positive contributions from both net exports and domestic demand.</p>  <p>  As regards Brexit, the Department&rsquo;s projections assume that a transition period will be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020, i.e. the UK is assumed to remain in the single market and customs union during this period.  From 2021 onwards, the baseline forecasts assume that the EU and UK conclude a trade agreement. This form of agreement results in any lower level of GDP over the 2021-2023 period relative to a hypothetical no-Brexit baseline scenario.</p>  <p>  Despite the relatively positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further disruption to trade or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy. Over the medium term, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment.</p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Pre-opening capitation funding and start-up grants are available to new Irish-medium and English-medium schools established in this way, and ongoing funding and resources are provided in line with national norms. </p>  <p>  I am taking the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;new independent Gaelscoileanna&rdquo; to mean new Irish-medium primary schools established by private parties.  There is no mechanism by which new independent primary schools established by private parties are recognised and/or supported by the Department.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in an area also have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, following completion of nationwide demographic exercises, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) to meet demographic needs. </p>  <p>  While a new school wasn&rsquo;t announced for the Ballyfermot_D10 and Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn_D12 areas, as with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data is being kept under ongoing review by the Department to take account of updated data.</p>  <p>  Regarding the language of instruction of a planned new school, a patronage process is run by my Department after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, along with their preference for the language of instruction (Irish or English) of the new school, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  It is through this process that a new primary school can be an Irish-medium Gaelscoil or an English-medium school.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process also provides an opportunity to increase the number of Gaelscoileanna nationwide.  This new process is aimed at accelerating the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools towards the Government target of 400 such schools by 2030.  The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-/non-denominational schools in Irish or English and an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.  </p>  <p>  Separately to the main Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process, school communities can directly engage with their school patron regarding transfer of patronage to become a multi-denominational school, including a multi-denominational Irish-medium school.   Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage should contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide, which in the case of Tipperary ETB includes a report on the Roscrea area. It is envisaged that these reports will be published on my Department's website www.education.ie in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  The Newport/Birdhill/Ballina is does not form part of the 16 areas selected by ETBs for the initial roll-out of this process.  However, separately to the main Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process, school communities can directly engage with their school patron regarding transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron.  For example, the &lsquo;early movers&rsquo; provision fast-tracks patronage reassignment.  The first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  </p>  <p>  Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the 'early movers' provision should contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.</p><p>For additional and more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following .</p></reply>

Together with my Department and its enterprise Agencies, I am focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country.  </p>  <p>  The annual results of the IDA demonstrate that we are making significant progress. In 2018, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by the Agency were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history.    </p>  <p>  While there were no new foreign direct investment (FDI) supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in FDI employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County.  Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase in IDA supported employment, with the creation of 67 new jobs last year. </p>  <p>  Since this question was last raised by the Deputy, IDA Ireland has released the site visit data for the first quarter of 2019 and Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath have each hosted one site visit so far this year. In 2018, County Meath reported a twofold increase in site visits with six visits last year. County Cavan hosted two site visits, whilst there were three site visits to County Monaghan, compared to one visit in 2017. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, as part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;10m for the next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme (RPP). The RPP includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan and a design and delivery team has been appointed for this Unit. </p>  <p>  The IDA has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to promote the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath, meanwhile, is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.</p>  <p>  We are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of all counties including those in the Border. The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create more jobs and source new investment in 2019.</p></reply>

The Government welcomes all new job announcements by businesses, and the announcement by Mr Price to create 200 jobs in Athlone in July of last year is very good news for Athlone and the Midlands. I look forward to the impact these jobs will have in the Midlands region. </p><p>My Department remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average. </p><p>The most recent CSO Labour Force Survey employment figures (Q4 2018) for the Midlands continue to show very good progress in employment levels.  From Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q4 2018, a total of 20,000 more people are in employment in the Midlands, and unemployment has more than halved in over the same period from 14.9 percent to 6.6 percent.</p><p>It is also important to note that as well as meeting the numerical targets, it is also about creating jobs that are of good quality and sustainable over the longer term.</p><p>To that end, on the 6th of February last in Mountmellick, I launched a new Regional Enterprise Plan to 2020 for the Midlands, one of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans that build on the progress achieved under the previous Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. </p><p>The Midlands Plan is focused around seven Strategic Objectives as follows: </p><p>1. Ensure that the Midlands is well positioned to address the challenges posed by the transition to a low carbon economy and renewable energy</p><p>2. Leverage opportunities in big data and data analytics from ILOFAR  </p><p>3. Position and support the growth of the Midlands as an advanced manufacturing centre of excellence  </p><p>4. Enhance the collective offering of the Midlands as a place to live, work and invest in</p><p>5. Strengthen the attractiveness of the Midlands as a destination to visit </p><p>6. Harness the potential of the food and beverage industry in the Midlands </p><p>7. Ensure the availability of skills and talent to realise the Midlands&rsquo; economic potential and address upskilling requirements</p><p>I'm pleased to report that the Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee has begun the process to drive delivery of the actions within the new Plan.</p></reply>

Quarter 4 in 2018 saw the highest number of permits issued in any quarter in the previous 10 years.  The high levels of permits being issued has continued into 2019 with a 44% increase in permits issued through Quarter 1 when compared to the same period in 2018.  A total of 3,878 permits have issued by end of March 2019 (which includes a number of permits that were applied for in 2018).</p><p>Through a combination of increased resources, staff working overtime and ICT and operational improvements, processing times are reducing with further improvements anticipated for standard applications in the coming weeks.</p><p>As well as the short-term measures introduced to date, my officials are currently seeking tenders for a Business Processing Reengineering study to be carried out to identify further efficiencies and identify possible new system requirements including exploring the development of a new IT system which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitisation.  In parallel with this new development, the Department is determined to continue to reduce processing times and is engaging extensively with stakeholders to ensure that they understand the process and that they comply with the application requirements so that no unnecessary delays occur..</p><p>There are currently approximately 1,890 permit applications in the processing queue, down from a peak of 3,230 in September 2018.  All permit applications remain in this queue until reached for processing at which stage the appropriate economic sector is assigned.  Therefore, there is no statistical breakdown by economic sector for applications in the processing queue.  However, please find the overall amount of permit applications in the processing queue that remained to be processed on the dates requested.</p><p><table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Employment Permit applications in processing queue at month end</th></tr><tr><td>31st December 2018</td><td>2,637</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2019</td><td>2,052</td></tr><tr><td>28th February 2019</td><td>1,975</td></tr><tr><td>31st March 2019</td><td>1,731</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is because there is a public interest in ensuring that ongoing and future investigations are not compromised by the disclosure of details of an individual investigation and the investigative process itself.</p><p>However, while it is not possible to publish the report itself, an account of the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer, in so far as they relate directly to the role of the ODCE, was published on 4 December 2018 on the website of my Department.  The account sets out the factors which led to the investigative shortcomings identified by the Judge, including the need for a broader skills base, a greater range and depth of knowledge and experience of criminal prosecutions within the Office and a greater appreciation of the necessity to employ appropriate procedures and manage risk.</p><p>Now that we know the factors that led to the shortcomings, our focus has shifted to ensuring we use the lessons of this investigation, note the steps already taken to address them and identify further measures to enhance the capacity of the ODCE to tackle corporate wrongdoing.</p><p>Since the time of the investigation, the Director has implemented multiple reforms within the ODCE, including staffing and procedural reforms that address many of the issues that led to the investigative shortcomings outlined by Judge Aylmer.  Further measures to be taken include the establishment, as announced by Government in November 2017, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as a stand-alone agency, to provide it with greater autonomy in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. </p><p>In his judgment, Judge Aylmer did not point to any deficiencies in the company law framework.  Nevertheless, as part of the process of preparing legislation to establish the ODCE as an Agency, any further powers that are identified as a requirement for carrying out the functions of the Agency will be conferred under statute as appropriate.</p><p>The General Scheme of a Bill to establish the ODCE as an Agency was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 4 December 2018 and is currently subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The General Scheme proposes new, or develops existing powers and investigative tools for the Agency, including:</p><p>Enhanced search and entry powers;</p><p>Admissibility of statements;</p><p>Access to telecom records;</p><p>Power to oblige liquidators to provide evidence that they are qualified to act as liquidators;</p><p>New grounds to apply to the Courts for an Order to restrict a person from acting as a director in winding-up situations.</p><p>With regard to the procedures pertaining to the parliamentary or committee system, such procedures are a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The resulting Audit Directive (2014/56/EU) and Regulation ((EU)(537/2014)) updated existing EU law. The package contained new legislative requirements including in relation to the independence regime between the audited entity and audit firm and auditor reporting. </p>  <p>  The Audit Directive and Regulation were given effect in S.I. 312 of 2016 and elevated to primary legislation in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018. The Regulatory Impact Analyses for S.I. 312 of 2016 and the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018 are each published on my Department&rsquo;s website with details of the Member State options exercised in the transposition. </p>  <p>  The new framework for statutory audit enhances independence requirements on all statutory auditors and audit firms such as the requirement to maintain professional scepticism and to assess possible threats to their independence in advance of taking up an audit engagement. The EU Regulation also introduced new obligations specifically addressed to the auditors of public interest entities i.e. credit institutions, insurance undertakings and listed entities. The main requirements on auditors and public interest entities in respect of independence are:</p>  <p>  - The prohibition of the provision of certain non-audit services to the audited entity and the provision of other non-audit services subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  - A cap on fees from non-audit services of 70% of audit fees, based on the average of the three preceding years audit fees.</p>  <p>  - A requirement to change auditor at least every ten years and to change the key audit partner every five years.</p>  <p>  In relation to auditor communication, the content of all audit reports now includes requirements to describe the scope of the statutory audit and to provide a statement on any material uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The EU Regulation also imposed additional obligations in respect of the audit report of public interest entities such as providing a description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement including assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud and the auditor&rsquo;s response to those risks.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the current requirements which have been in place since 2016 but, as with all areas of policy and law, their impact will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published recently and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.</p>  <p>  The NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p></reply>

The HSE completed the first phase of their work in relation to the agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Following constructive engagement with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission, an agreement was reached on 2 October between the parties.  Pay restoration will commence with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019 for those employed by the 50 organisations involved in the pilot.  Any outstanding balance will be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE are undertaking a further validation exercise of those 50 pilot organisations and their funding requirements to enable the pay restoration.  Further information was requested from these organisations.  It is recognised that some of the organisations which did not form part of this pilot phase are likely to have pay restoration issues also.  A process of engagement to address this will commence in 2019.</p></reply>

In the months since then, there was a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This included women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.  This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome but has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been undertaking a global search for laboratory capacity to help alleviate the backlog and has recently advised that it has identified additional capacity internationally.

The Emergency Department is located at Cavan General Hospital, while the facilities at Monaghan Hospital are focused on elective care and the streaming of appropriate patients to the Minor Injuries Unit located on site.</p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework defined the role of smaller hospitals and outlined the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate within Hospital Groups.  The Framework identified the activities that can be performed in smaller Model 2 hospitals, like Monaghan Hospital, in a safe and sustainable manner. In developing our smaller hospitals, the first and over-riding concern is the safety of patients. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in the establishment and development of Hospital Groups over the last few years. Our hospitals are now working together and supporting each other in Groups.  This new way of working provides a stronger role for smaller hospitals, like Monaghan Hospital, in delivering a higher volume of less complex care in many cases closer to patients&rsquo; homes. It also ensures that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in a larger hospital environment.</p>  <p>  With regards to the Minor Injuries Unit, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Department of Health is committed to undertaking a review of Medical Assessment Units, Minor Injuries Units and similar units with a view to extending their opening hours. Minor Injuries Clinics and similar units provide valuable services to local communities and alleviate the pressures on Emergency Departments. The Minor Injury Unit in Monaghan Hospital is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm and can treat both adults and children over 5 years with non-life-threatening or limb-threatening injuries.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017, hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity. </p>  <p>  This is a very busy period for our health services, with many sites reporting significant numbers of patient attendances. In the first 2 months of 2019, the number of patients attending our hospital Emergency Departments increased by 7% and the number of Emergency Department admissions increased by 5% compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  Despite this significant increase in demand, our health services have managed better than in previous years and based on provisional data, the numbers of patients on trolleys were 15% lower between December and February this winter than the previous winter. </p>  <p>  The establishment of Hospital Groups has enabled a better configuration of hospital services with benefits relating to safety, quality, access, cost and sustainable medical staffing. The structure ensures that Hospitals working together in a Group will be able to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care, and ensuring that those who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these smaller hospitals.  The Department of Health is committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals, including Model 3 hospitals such as Cavan Hospital, with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics.</p>  <p>  Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion for Health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care. Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue. As to be expected with such a plan, many proposals are at an early stage and will require to progress through appraisal, planning design and tender before a firm timeline or funding required can be established.</p>  <p>  The planning and management of future health expenditure is considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.</p></reply>

There will also be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in Council Regulations.  </p>  <p>  The recent meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament concluded a series of votes on the CAP reform package, including the adoption of an alternative compromise amendment on internal convergence which calls for full harmonisation of aid per hectare within Member States by 2027.</p>  <p>  My Department is a strong proponent of evidence-based policy making, and I can confirm that work is currently underway to analyse the impact of the various elements of direct payments in the draft regulations. Preliminary modelling exercises have been carried out and the results of these analyses are currently being reviewed and revised to take account of the most recently available data.</p>  <p>  All direct payment measures including the proposed Basic Income Support for Sustainability payment, the Complementary Redistribution of Income Support for Sustainability payment, the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers and the Eco-Schemes are inextricably linked to each other. This means that each time one of the elements is changed, each of the other elements also must change. As a result, any analysis, including analysis on convergence, only remains current until one of the elements changes. </p>  <p>  This state of flux is likely to continue until the regulations are fully developed, at which time detailed analyses will be completed to fully address the impact on farmers in Ireland of CAP 2020. This methodology is congruent with the requirement for each Member State to prepare a Strategic Plan addressing all aspects of CAP expenditure and, consequently, all of these analyses remain at a drafting stage until the Regulations are resolved.</p></reply>

It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p><p>The loans will be competitively priced at 4.5% or lower, will be for terms of 8 to 10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  </p><p>There is a minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs or &euro;50,000 for primary agriculture. The maximum loan amount is &euro;3,000,000 and loans of under &euro;500,000 will be made on an unsecured basis. There will be &euro;50 - &euro;60 million in loan funding available initially for farmers, within an overall agrifood package of &euro;120 million. Should demand exceed these levels, this can be reviewed.</p><p>The Scheme features a two-stage application process whereby initial application is made through the SBCI website. Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number, which can then be used in an application to one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p><p>The Scheme will open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI from 17th April.

It is important, however, that private sector and business in general take a lead themselves in considering climate impacts in their long term strategic planning and investment decisions, and assess climate risks to their own assets and activities.   Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework (NAF) represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into local, regional and national policy making. The National Adaptation Framework (NAF) identifies the need for Government to engage with the private sector in shaping and developing their adaptation strategies and plans and also identifies the need for further research into the impacts of climate change on enterprise.</p>  <p>  The National Adaptation Framework (NAF) recognises that the availability of accurate, consistent and authoritative data, information and analysis specific to Ireland is crucial to how effective we are in developing climate resilience. Information platforms such as Climate Ireland, which was developed under the EPA Research Programme, can help to provide business with more accurate information on the projected impacts of climate change and encourage them to take action to lower their exposure to the impacts of climate change. My Department is currently developing proposals in relation to the future of Climate Ireland in conjunction with the EPA.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities will also have an important role to play in engaging with businesses on climate change at local level. In 2018, my Department provided &euro;10 million to establish and fund four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs). The CAROs will provide a focal point for businesses and communities to partner and collaborate with Local Authorities in delivering on meaningful climate action initiatives at a local level. </p>  <p>  I'm currently working with my Government colleagues across all Departments to develop an All of Government Climate Plan. The Climate Plan will set out a detailed road map ensuring a whole of government integrated strategy and including a review of the challenges associated with the availability of property (home and business) insurance and possible responses. The All of Government Plan will require mobilisation across all sectors - including buildings, heat, transport, industry and agriculture to step up Ireland's response to climate change. </p></reply>

The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making.    Under the Framework, seven Government Departments with responsibility for twelve priority sectors are required to prepare sectorial adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The deadline for the submission of sectorial adaptation plans to Government for approval is 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right. Under the National Adaptation Framework, each Local Authority is required to develop a local adaptation strategy. Local Authorities have been set a deadline for the completion of local strategies by 30 September 2019. In January 2018, my Department entered into a funding commitment of &euro;10m over 5 years to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices(CAROs). A key priority for the CAROs in 2019 will be to support the Local Authorities within their region to develop their local adaptation strategies and ensure they align with national adaptation policy and sectorial priorities. </p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is an iterative process, with the National Adaptation Framework to be reviewed at least once every five years in line with the 2015 Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions as appropriate as climate projections are updated.</p></reply>

Met &Eacute;ireann is the leading provider of weather information and related services in the State with its mission to monitor, analyse and predict Ireland&rsquo;s weather and climate and to provide a range of high quality meteorological and related information to the public and to specific customers in, for example, the aviation and agricultural sectors. Questions in relation to Government policy on severe weather alerts are a matter for Met &Eacute;ireann.   Ireland&rsquo;s National Adaptation Framework (NAF) which was published in January 2018 identifies Met &Eacute;ireann as a key provider of technical and advisory support and climate services at national level. Met &Eacute;ireann is also represented on the national adaptation steering committee, which is chaired by my Department and which coordinates climate adaptation policy at both national and local level. My Department will continue to liaise with Met &Eacute;ireann and be guided by their expertise in relation to all areas that come under their remit.</p></reply>

Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll-out of the scheme for the period up to 2027.The first phase of the scheme, an installation grant for heat pumps, opened for applications in September 2018. This phase of the scheme will support ground, air and water source electric heat pump installations providing grant-aid of up to 30% of the installation cost. This phase of the scheme was implemented under the State aid General Block Exemption Regulation and did not require prior approval from the European Commission.</p><p>The second phase of the scheme, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems followed the full State aid notification process. Earlier this week (15 April) , the European Commission published a notification that it had approved the scheme under State aid rules. The Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the scheme are in the process of being finalised and will ensure full compliance with the requirements set out in the State aid approval. </p><p>While no date has been set, the completion of the State aid approval process is a key step and I expect to be in a position to announce the opening of the second phase of the scheme in the near future. </p><p>Further details of the scheme are available on my Department's website at the following .</p></reply>

A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   In December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019. </p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018.</p>  <p>  There are currently a number of on-going procurements in relation to the project being undertaken and managed by ESB Networks, such as tower design. However no critical procurement contracts such as construction will be concluded until all planning issues in Northern Ireland are resolved. The earliest possible date for construction to commence is early 2020.</p></reply>

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible. </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. This 'poverty-proofs' the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme.  It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.  Many working families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.  Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  For example, a family with a child aged two in full-time care (40 hours) and currently benefitting from the maximum subsidy of &euro;145 per week under CCS Band A, would see their subsidy increase to &euro;174 per week, an additional subsidisation of &euro;1,500 per annum.</p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. So, whilst there may have been fears that, in a small number of cases, where a family currently receiving the maximum amount of financial support for full-time childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the new Scheme, particularly if their child is, in reality, receiving after-school care only rather than full-time childcare, they will not lose out.  The family can continue to access their current targeted supports (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until the end of August 2020, 16 months from now. </p>  <p>  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.  In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed so that families who need the most support can receive it. Maximum subsidy rates are payable in all cases where a family meets the lowest income threshold, tapering down smoothly as income increases.</p>  <p>  An Income Assessed subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy will vary depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child. Where parents are not working, studying or training, the subsidy will be paid for up to a maximum of 15 hours per week. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for enhanced hours (i.e. up to a maximum of 40 hours per week), both the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s partner, if applicable, must meet at least one of the following criteria, they must be:</p>  <p>  - In work</p>  <p>  - In study </p>  <p>  - Transitioning into, or out of, work or study</p>  <p>  - Unavailable to provide childcare for the child.</p></reply>

No. 8 of 2006) was implemented, in 2006.  The Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court or an Adjudication Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p><p>The Code seeks to: </p><p>- Encourage best practice and conformity with the provisions of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2004 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001;</p><p>- Promote the development of policies and procedures to assist employers, employees and their representatives, as appropriate, to improve access to part-time work for those employees who wish to work on a part-time basis;</p><p>- Promote discussion and encourage employers, employees and their representatives, as appropriate, to consider part-time work and to address any barriers that may exist;</p><p>- Stimulate employers - where consistent with business requirements - to provide wider access to part-time work options;</p><p>- Provide a framework and practical guidance on procedures for accessing part-time work;</p><p>- Inform those who are interested in part-time work.</p><p>Further information regarding the rights of part-time employees is available from Workplace Relations Commission's Information and Customer Service.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through blended delivery, involving increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 homes, through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and supporting some 88,000 further households through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  Over the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 90,000 households were supported under current programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 90,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Looking at it another way, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for those 90,000 households. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding lreland is working, with annual delivery targets exceeded in 2017 and again in 2018. By end 2018, over 72,000 additional social housing supports had already been provided under the Plan. I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for delivering homes for those on social housing waiting lists.</p></reply>

Collection of data in relation to the number of households making a top-up payment to their landlord does not form part of the standard reporting process of my Department.  However, the information available to the HAP Shared Service Centre operated by Limerick City and County Council indicates that approximately three quarters of all HAP tenancies are fully supported.</p>  <p>  In the case of other tenancies, it should be noted that there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  This reflects the fact that, unlike Rent Supplement, where payment ceases in certain circumstances, HAP support can continue to be paid where a household&rsquo;s income increases, including for reasons of the tenant taking up full-time employment.  In those cases, it would therefore be expected that some tenants would consider rental options, which they source themselves in the private rental market, that would involve them paying an element of rent beyond the HAP rent limits, enabled to do so by their improved income position.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where they are not satisfied that the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.  </p>  <p>   My Department does not collect information in relation to social welfare payments; however, a local authority will take into consideration all relevant income when assessing a HAP application.</p></reply>

These regulations do not contain a reference to a 35% of net income threshold.</p>  <p>  Section 84 (2) of the 2009 Act provides that where a household applies to a housing authority to purchase an affordable dwelling under an affordable dwelling purchase arrangement, the housing authority shall carry out an assessment of the household's eligibility.  This assessment will take into account a range of factors, including the provisions of section 84 (2)(b), which provides that the assessment will have regard as to whether the income of the household is adequate to meet the repayments on a mortgage, i.e. that payments should not exceed 35% of the household's annual income, net of income tax and PSRI. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, this is another measure which seeks to address issues of affordability. Rather than a Loan to Income (LTI) limit of the nature suggested, a maximum permissible Net Disposable Income (NDI) ratio of 35% is used in respect of the loan. This reflects more accurately the benefit to the individual of the low fixed rate available for the full life of the loan.</p></reply>

As part of this, the future housing needs of our growing population are of course among the key issues that will be addressed through the NPF.  </p>  <p>  The NDP established four new funds, with a combined allocation of &euro;4 billion to 2027.  The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which is the fund operated by my Department, was launched last year and has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.  &euro;58m is available in 2019 to provide initial support to the 88 projects announced last November on foot of the first call for proposals.  &euro;550 million is included in the NDP to provide further support for these and other similar projects up to 2022.</p>  <p>  The URDF was established to support applicant led projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and the NDP. The aim is to achieve more compact, sustainable and mixed use development, with a view to ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. This will be done by supporting proposals that contribute to the re-development of key brownfield areas both by enabling infrastructure and new master-planned development proposals.</p>  <p>  While the URDF is not intended to provide direct support for particular housing projects, some of the projects it is currently supporting will enable a significant proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund  falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development. </p></reply>
