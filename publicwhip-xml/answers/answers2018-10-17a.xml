    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-17a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101700069#WRA00600"><p>The Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September and set out a wide range of principles and innovative proposals aimed at empowering the Garda Commissioner to ensure more effective management of the Garda organisation; strengthening our national security arrangements; supporting the governance of the Garda organisation through the introduction of a Board and reforming the method of recruitment and training of Garda&iacute;.  It also makes a number of recommendations on external oversight arrangements as well as on the Commissioner&rsquo;s engagement with the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration. My Department is engaged in a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with the other Government departments impacted by the report's recommendations. As part of this process, I have asked the Garda  Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  I have also written to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality and I look forward to hearing their direct response to the Report in the coming weeks.  I also understand that Kathleen O'Toole, the Chair of the Commission, has been invited to address the Committee next month.  I am very grateful to Ms. O'Toole and the other members of the Commission for their comprehensive report and I believe this will be a very useful engagement which will allow members to hear directly from the Commission as to how it approached its task and reached its detailed findings.</p>  <p>  Once these engagements are completed, I will bring a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure to Government for approval before the end of the year. This Implementation Plan will also take careful account of the conclusions of the third interim report of the Disclosures Tribunal.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach, is moving quickly to establish the Implementation Group for Policing Reform and Implementation Programme Office as recommended by the Commission.  These matters are being advanced at Secretary General level and I expect these structures to be in place in the near future including the appointment of an Independent Chair to lead the Implementation Group.  Given the whole-of-Government reach of the report which envisages a new holistic approach to policing and public safety, this Implementation Group and Programme Office will be based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  </p>  <p>  Funding has already been provided to support the transformation envisaged by the Report.  In 2019 the Garda Vote will increase by &euro;110 million to &euro;1.76 billion.  This money will support ongoing recruitment and further civilianisation to fill critical skills gaps and enable the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line policing which are identified as priorities.  The need for digital innovation and information is also strongly highlighted by the Commission and I am pleased that funding of approx &euro;65 million for ICT has been provided in 2019.  In addition funding of &euro;10 million is provided in 2019 for the Justice and Policing and Transformation Programmes and further funding will of course be provided to support this far-reaching transformation project in future years.</p>  <p>  While the programme of reform that the Commission outlined is undoubtedly an opportunity for transformational change, it is also extremely challenging, requiring actions across Government. It is prudent that we take some time now to ensure that the necessary structures and resources are in place to deliver this needed reform.  It will take time to fully implement the recommendations in the report and the Commission has suggested that the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022 would be an appropriate target for the transformation to be completed. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-17a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101700069#WRA01000"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of Garda personnel among the various Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I do not politically interfere in policing matters nor direct the Commissioner where to deploy resources.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Commissioner&rsquo;s responsibility I have provided for the record, in tabular form, the detailed information requested by the Deputy. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Clare Division on 31 August 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 316. There are also 6 Garda Reserves and 33 Garda civilian staff attached to the Clare Division. When necessary, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I wish to take the opportunity to again confirm the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring that the organisation is appropriately resourced.</p><p>Garda recruitment effectively ended in 2010 and did not resume till September 2014 when the Government reopened the Garda College in Templemore once the economy had stabilised.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since then 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 37 have been assigned to the Clare Division. I am pleased that the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will reach over 14,000 members by the end of 2018 for the first time in many years.  </p><p>I strongly welcome the funding provided in Budget 2019 for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda recruits next year, along with necessary civilian Garda staff. This ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties following civilianisation of their roles. The net benefit of this is the increased Garda visibility and greater response to the policing needs of communities in every Garda Division including the Clare Division.<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th><div>CLARE DIVISION 31 AUGUST 2018</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>DIVISION</div></td><td><div>DISTRICT</div></td><td><div>STATION</div></td><td><div>TOTAL</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>ENNIS</td><td>CRUSHEEN</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>ENNIS</td><td><div>130</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>IMMIGRATION OFFICE</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILLALOE</td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>NEWMARKET ON FERGUS  </td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>SCARIFF</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>SHANNON</td><td><div>57</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>SIXMILEBRIDGE</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TULLA</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNIS  Total</td><td></td><td><div>237</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILRUSH</td><td>BALLYVAUGHAN</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>COROFIN</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>ENNISTYMON</td><td><div>29</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILDYSART</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILKEE</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILMIHIL</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILRUSH</td><td><div>41</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>LISDOONVARNA</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILRUSH  Total</td><td></td><td><div>79</div></td></tr><tr><td>CLARE   Total</td><td></td><td></td><td><div>316</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Garda Reserves Clare Division by Station 31 August 2018</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilrush</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Killaloe</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The review will examine the adequacy of the mechanisms available in law and practice to protect and support victims of sexual violence through the judicial process. This will include practical supports for vulnerable witnesses through the reporting, investigation and trial processes; provision of additional legal supports to witnesses during the court processes and measures in place to protect vulnerable witnesses during evidence, including the use of measures such as pre-recorded evidence or video-link. Any considerations of this nature would, of course, need to take into account the rights of an accused person and the balance of justice. </p>  <p>  I have asked Mr. Tom O&rsquo; Malley BL., Senior Lecturer in Law at NUI Galway and member of the Law Reform Commission, to chair the review. I am very grateful to Mr O&rsquo;Malley for agreeing to take on this role and he will bring a wealth of expertise to this issue. The review will form part of the work programme of the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee and the review working group includes representatives of my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service and the Courts Service. </p>  <p>  I have asked that the report of the review be made to me by the end of the year or as soon as possible thereafter. The views and experiences of stakeholders will be considered as part of this review and I myself met with a number of victim support organisations earlier this year to understand where they feel improvements can be made. I am committed to taking on board any recommendations arising from the review and ensuring that we have a robust system in place to deal with sexual offences which is sensitive to the needs of vulnerable victims.</p></reply>

In this regard, I have been advised that relevant personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), in particular, are provided clear instruction to not engage in racial profiling, in the course of fulfilling immigration-related duties. </p>  <p>  The GNIB was established in May 2000 to provide an effective, organisational, structure to support the enforcement of Immigration policy, which rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Bureau is responsible for immigration controls at points of entry into the State, a role which, in recent times, has been shared at Dublin Airport with the Irish Naturalisation &amp;amp; Immigration Service (INIS). Other immigration-related functions undertaken by GNIB include the removal of persons who have been refused permission to land in the State; enforcement of Deportation, Removal and Transit Orders; the provision of a non-national registration service outside of Dublin &amp;amp; maintenance of an associated database; and the implementation of effective strategies to combat smuggling of illegal immigrants.</p>  <p>  The recently published Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report comprehensively addresses issues regarding the role and respect for human rights in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have a human rights strategy and a human rights unit within the organisation to develop, implement and monitor the strategy.  The importance of human rights training is also addressed in the report.</p></reply>

This new scheme will, initially, provide for 2 weeks of paid, non-transferable leave per parent, with a view to expanding the scheme in future years.</p>  <p>  This new scheme delivers on the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, as research shows that parental care is of particular importance and benefit in the first twelve months.  The new scheme is the key recommendation of the report of an interdepartmental committee which was established to develop recommendations as to how the Programme for Partnership Government commitments could be best implemented.  The Government is considering the report at present. </p>  <p>  The Government has indicated, in the context of Dail Eireann's consideration of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, a Private Member's Bill, that it agrees with the proposal to raise the qualifying age of the child in respect of whom unpaid parental leave can be obtained from 8 years of age to 12 years of age.  The Government recognises that parents may need to avail of unpaid parental leave for an older child in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

Developing this level of structural and organisational change, particularly while progressing existing Government priorities, will require considerable investment in specialist expertise and support.  A procurement process is underway to obtain the required external specialist expertise to support the Department in designing and implementing the new structure.  That process is expected to conclude in the coming weeks with a contract being put in place in November. </p>  <p>  The cost of the project will be dependent on the outcome of this procurement process, and on the final detailed design of the new operating model.  A provision of &euro;10m has been made in Budget 2019 to support both the Department and policing transformation programmes.  This is intended to cover a variety of costs that will arise in both programmes in 2019.</p></reply>

In addition, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also make use of the on-call doctor service when dealing with such incidents.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which provides for Garda powers to take into custody persons believed to be suffering from a mental disorder, may be invoked by the Garda&iacute; where they come into contact with a mentally ill person in a crisis situation.  In such situations, it may appear that the person is a danger to himself/herself or to others. Section 12 may be invoked to ensure that a medical assessment and admission to an approved centre and treatment in accordance with that Act are accessed.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that during Phase 1 of their training in the Garda College new recruits learn about the various types of mental illness and Garda powers and procedures for dealing with a vulnerable person suffering from a mental illness. They also receives training in how to intervene when there is an immediate risk of suicide. The vulnerability of suspects, witnesses and injured parties is also embedded in all training courses for Investigative Interviewing</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing considered the issue of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dealing with incidents concerning mental health.  The Commission's Report redefined policing as a multi-disciplinary, cross agency effort built on the foundation of protecting human rights.  Of particular note is its emphasis on understanding policing as including not only the prevention and detection of crime, but also the prevention of harm and protection of vulnerable people, and the implications of this for the whole of Government </p>  <p>  The report recommends that the prevention of harm including providing support to people with a mental health condition should be explicitly identified as a core objective of policing.  My officials have commenced a consultation process with other Government Departments and with the various agencies with a remit in this area and I intend to seek the Government&rsquo;s approval for a High-level Implementation Plan before the end of this session. </p></reply>

Further, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy will be aware of the significant efforts being made by Government to enhance the working environment for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In particular, unprecedented investment has been committed under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 to upgrade Garda premises, the Garda fleet and Garda ICT infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Garda estate, I would refer to the Deputy to the Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021.  This ambitious programme, based on agreed Garda priorities, is backed by over &euro;60 million Exchequer funding, as well as a major Public Private Partnership project.  This is in addition to over &euro;100 million the Government provided for construction of the new Regional and Divisional Headquarters now operational in Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street, Dublin. </p>  <p>  The Programme is benefiting over 30 locations nationwide and will provide new stations and modernise older stations at key locations, ensuring a safe, modern working environment for members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects.</p>  <p>  I understand that provision is made under the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme for works at the existing Garda Divisional Headquarters at Navan.  These works to Navan Garda Station include demolition of the existing cell block, construction of a new cell block and overhead office accommodation.  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is actively engaged with the OPW to progress this project. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Courts Service has not yet identified a particular site, in relation to delivery of the new court intended for Navan in the context of Project Ireland 2040.  </p>  <p>  However I can inform the Deputy that the OPW and Garda authorities inform me that every effort is made to ensure good value for money in the building and refurbishment works undertaken to address the deficiencies in the Garda estate.  I am informed that the OPW and AGS remain in contact regarding any future needs in Navan, which would have to be considered in the context of available resources and overall Garda accommodation priorities nationwide. </p></reply>

The Convention recognises that international co-operation in criminal law should further the ends of justice and social rehabilitation of prisoners and that this may be best achieved by having them transferred to serve their sentences in their own countries.  The Minister of the day has discretion under the Transfer of Persons Acts to decide whether to consent to any such transfer.</p>  <p>  A number of factors, including the Supreme Court Judgment in the case of O'Farrell, McDonald, Rafferty -v-The Governor of Portlaoise Prison, have implications for the continuance in its present form of the process operated by the Irish Prison Service for transferring prisoners from other States to Ireland. </p>  <p>  That judgment found against the State and raised a number of complex issues about the legislation itself and its administration.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Court of Appeal decision in the case M.McK v The Minister for Justice and Equality [2016] IEHC 208, has clarified that the Minister should ultimately consider each application on its own merits and give detailed reasoning for the decision reached. </p>  <p>  The judgment also concludes that the Minister cannot fail to implement legislation through prolonged inactivity of a statutory scheme such as the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts.  As the Deputy is aware, following the judgment, all existing applications have been reactivated and will be re-considered on their own merits.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that here are currently 7 cases being processed from applicants from outside the UK jurisdiction.  Each case is at a different stage of the application process and all cases require the collation of a number of reports, e.g. Garda Reports and Probation Service Reports, some of which are still outstanding in a number of these cases. </p>  <p>  The issues raised in the judgments also required substantive consideration by my officials, which indicates that legislative change is required, and my Department is currently finalising a draft scheme of a Bill for consideration by Government. Following this, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will be asked to draft a Bill to deal with these issues as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Budget also provides for the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.</p>  <p>  As I said on Budget day, the Commissioner will need to consider all aspects of the funding requirement in the Garda Vote and how all resources at his disposal can be best deployed including in relation to the composition of the Service.  I expect to receive his proposals in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  Since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014, we have been rebuilding the Garda organisation and I am pleased that, since then, approximately 2,200 new Garda members have attested and assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. Garda numbers will increase to approximately 14,000 by the end of this year for the first time since 2011. </p>  <p>  In addition to the vision of 15,000 Garda members by 2021, plans are also in place for 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserves. I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 August 2018 there were 2,330 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda Siochana. I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, albeit more slowly than anticipated.  It is clear, however, that progress is being made with close to 300 new civilian staff posts sanctioned to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation.  This will allow more Garda&iacute; to focus on operational policing duties where their training and specialist expertise can be put to best use. Already approximately 150 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to operational policing duties and I expect these numbers to accelerate in the coming months and throughout 2019. Work is also continuing on a strategic review of the Garda Reserve which I expect to be concluded shortly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September. This innovative report sets out a number of  recommendations across the policing sector and in particular on the work of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, including the Garda reserve. I am currently consulting widely on the issues raised including with the Garda Commissioner in advance of returning to Government in December with a high level implementation plan.  </p></reply>

I do not politically interfere in policing matters nor direct the Commissioner where to deploy resources.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Commissioner&rsquo;s responsibility I have provided for the record, in tabular form, the detailed information requested by the Deputy. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Tipperary Division on 31 August 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 393. There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 42 Garda civilian staff attached to the Tipperary Division. When necessary, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I wish to take the opportunity to again confirm the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring that the organisation is appropriately resourced.</p><p>Garda recruitment effectively ended in 2010 and did not resume till September 2014 when the Government reopened the Garda College in Templemore once the economy had stabilised.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since then 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 48 have been assigned to the Tipperary Division. I am pleased that the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will reach over 14,000 members by the end of 2018 for the first time in many years.  </p><p>I strongly welcome the funding provided in Budget 2019 for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda recruits next year, along with necessary civilian Garda staff. This ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties following civilianisation of their roles. The net benefit of this is the increased Garda visibility and greater response to the policing needs of communities in every Garda Division including the Tipperary Division.</p><p><b>TIPPERARY DIVISION 31 AUGUST 2018</b><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>DIVISION</td><td>DISTRICT</td><td>STATION</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>CAHIR</td><td>ARDFINNAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>BALLYPOREEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CAHIR</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CASHEL</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CLOGHEEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAHIR</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONMEL</td><td>CARRICK-ON-SUIR</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CLONMEL</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>FETHARD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILSHEELAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>MULLINAHONE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONMEL</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NENAGH</td><td>BORRISOKANE</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CLOUGHJORDAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>LORRHA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>MONEYGALL</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>NENAGH</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>NEWPORT</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>PORTROE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>ROSCREA</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NENAGH</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>THURLES</td><td>BALLINGARRY SOUTH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>BORRISOLEIGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>HOLYCROSS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>KILLENAULE</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TEMPLEMORE</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TEMPLETUOHY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>THURLES</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>THURLES</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>BANSHA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CAPPAWHITE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>EMLY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>GOLDEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY  TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>393</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Garda Reserves Tipperary Division by Station 31 August 2018.</b><table><tr><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Thurles</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Templemore</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Clonmel</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Cahir</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cashel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscrea</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Carrick-On Suir</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Templederry</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>16</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference. </p>  <p>  The Report makes many innovative proposals aimed at strengthening our national security arrangements; empowering the Garda Commissioner to ensure more effective management of the Garda organisation; supporting the governance of the Garda organisation through the introduction of a Board as referenced by the Deputy; and reforming the method of recruitment and training of Garda&iacute;.  It also makes a number of recommendations on external oversight arrangements as well as on the Commissioner&rsquo;s engagement with the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration. My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations. As part of this process, I have asked the Garda  Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  I have also written to the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality and I look forward to hearing their direct response to the Report in the coming weeks. Once this engagement is completed, I will return to Government to discuss my substantive response as well as a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In that context my Department, in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach, is moving quickly to establish the Implementation Group for Policing Reform and Implementation Programme Office as recommended by the Commission.  These matters are being advanced at a senior official level and I expect these structures to be in place in the near future including the appointment of an Independent Chair to lead the Implementation Group.  Given the whole-of-Government reach of the report which envisages a new holistic approach to policing and public safety, this Implementation Group and Programme Office will be based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  </p>  <p>  While the programme of reform that the Commission outlined is undoubtedly an opportunity for transformational change, it is also extremely challenging, requiring actions across Government. It is prudent that we take some time now to ensure that the necessary structures and resources are in place to deliver this needed reform.  It will take time to fully implement the recommendations in the report and the Commission has suggested that the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022 would be an appropriate target for the transformation to be completed. </p></reply>

The function of using less than lethal weapons is for circumstances where it is necessary to avoid the use of firearms.  The use of firearms is permitted only to repel serious attacks on Garda&iacute;, members of the public or property, or in the arrest or re-arrest of persons involved in serious offences.  </p>  <p>  Less lethal weapons are not routinely carried by the Garda members authorised to use them as their deployment is intended for critical incidents.  The criteria applied to the use of less lethal weapons is, therefore, intentionally strict so as to limit their use in daily operations.  However, I believe it is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have at their disposal the necessary tools to ensure the safety of the public at large, and the Garda members themselves.  On this basis, I work closely with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that sufficient resources are put at his disposal so as to successfully execute the work of the force.</p>  <p>  In order to monitor and control the use of such weapons, I am informed that a system of reporting incidents of use is in place both internally within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and externally via a reporting mechanism with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, the use of Incapacitant Spray must be initially reported to the member&rsquo;s immediate supervisor where such use occurs other than in training.  This must also be reported prior to the conclusion of the member&rsquo;s tour of duty and an incident report on the matter leading to the weapon&rsquo;s use created on the Garda computer system.  </p>  <p>  With regards the reporting of incidents involving the use of incapacitating spray to GSOC, I have been advised that other than in training or in the humane destruction of animals, and which do not result in the death of, or serious harm to a person, these incidents must be notified to GSOC within 48 hours by the District Officer for the area where the incident occurred.</p>  <p>  The process for this notification is set out in Garda HQ Directive 10/2010 which came into effect on 26 January 2010.  This directive requires members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to notify GSOC of the discharge of a firearm, or less lethal device, including Incapacitant Spray, within 48 hours using an Annex 2 Notification.  This notification must be signed off by the local District Officer prior to being forwarded to the Ombudsman Commission.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 34%.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that all eligible persons have access to civil legal aid and advice is a priority for the Board and the Government. </p>  <p>  Applicants for civil legal aid must meet a financial test based on their disposable income and capital assets. In addition, applicants are required to meet a merits test which is provided for in the Act.  The merits test includes such criteria as likelihood of success, the legal basis for taking or defending proceedings, and, in some but not all case types, the costs and benefit associated with pursuing the matter in question by means of civil litigation.</p>  <p>  The Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically reviews the scheme's operation. In 2017, the Board submitted a number of proposals to my Department in relation to the financial eligibility thresholds and other general legislative amendments including removal of contributions sought from victims of domestic violence. My Department progressed this latter element of the proposal separately and from 1 January 2018, a contribution is no longer required of persons granted legal aid in connection with proceedings where the sole remedy is an order pursuant to the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  Statutory Instrument 626 of 2017 gave effect to this. Both the Board and my Department are actively working on the remaining elements of the submission which require further detailed analysis.</p></reply>

Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols in a uniform that deliberately distinguishes them from their unarmed uniformed colleagues. </p>  <p>  I am advised that in the event of an armed incident or similar outrage armed Detective members from local Districts and Divisional units respond, as do the Armed Response Units, which are based at two locations in each Garda Region.

A series of thematic consultation sessions are scheduled to take place throughout October and November facilitated by LGBTI experts and researchers to support the development of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Strategy will take a whole of Government approach to improving outcomes for LGBTI people in Ireland.  Accordingly, consultation with other Government Departments is a key feature of the strategic development process.</p>  <p>  The first inter-departmental meeting on the development of the strategy took place in June 2018. Representatives from fourteen departments and agencies, including the Department of Health, were present to identify the key areas on which the proposed strategy should focus on and how Departments can address the issues identified in specific sectors.</p>  <p>  The Department will draw upon an impressive range of recent research to inform the consultation process and subsequent drafting of the plan.  For example, in reference to mental health, the 2016 LGBT Ireland Report provides an important source of information on a national study of the mental health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people in Ireland.</p>  <p>  LGBTI+ people are identified as a priority group in Connecting for Life, Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available to young people with mental health difficulties, either through services provided directly by the HSE, or through various non-statutory agencies funded by the Executive.  In particular, this includes support by the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) for LGBTI+ advocacy groups, such as Belong To or other groups that also cover, to some degree as part of their overall mental health services, LGBTI+ issues relating to young persons.</p>  <p>  A Good Practice Guide was developed by the Psychological Society of Ireland in collaboration with GLEN (Gay and Lesbian Equality Network) and the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention. The Guidelines inform psychologists of what they need to know when providing a psychology service to a lesbian, gay or bisexual person.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality will continue to consult with other Government Departments throughout the development period.  A further inter-departmental meeting is planned towards the end of November to provide an update on issues arising from the consultation and seek inputs as regards potential policy responses.</p>  <p>  I am seeking to finalise the strategy early next year.</p></reply>

This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT which is now an important element of the fight against crime &ndash; this substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in their daily work. The Budget also provides for a further &euro;10 million investment in the Transport Fleet and &euro;17 million in the Garda Building Programme.

My Department is currently analysing the Report and my officials are currently engaging in consultations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the policing oversight bodies and the relevant Departments in order to inform my substantive response and the high-level implementation plan and project structure that I intend to bring to Government by December.  </p>  <p>  With respect to the Deputy's question, while the most recent publication of the official recorded crime statistics remain 'Under Reservation', it is important to note the Central Statistics Office (CSO), in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to make good progress on returning the crime figures to the higher standard expected of our national crime statistics. I am determined that this body of work be completed as soon as possible and I welcome the continued diligence of the Policing Authority in monitoring this matter.</p>  <p>  I welcome the slight decrease in burglary offences (-0.8%) for Q2 2018 and, while I am concerned at the rise in recorded incidents of robberies year on year, it should be noted that both these categories remain at low levels when compared with the years 2014 and 2015. </p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda Siochana that through targeted initiatives at District, Divisional, Regional and National level, Garda&iacute; use a range of interventions to target various facets of criminality, to prevent and detect crime, including, proactive patrolling of &lsquo;crime hot spots&rsquo; as identified on a weekly and monthly basis based on analytics provided by Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service (GSAS), targeted crime prevention advice, and the management of prolific offenders. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works in partnership with other Government Departments and agencies and expands the policy options available to reduce crime beyond the immediate realm of policing. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government also remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to tackle all forms of violent crime in our community, including sexual assaults. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to tackle this insidious form of violence and abuse. Recent Garda measures include the establishment of the National Protective Services Bureau which is tasked with improving services to victims of sexual and domestic violence, improving the investigation of sexual and domestic violence incidents, and identifying and managing risk.</p>  <p>  I would also make the point that an increase in recorded incidents of sexual assault can also indicate an increase in the reporting of sexual crimes and I urge anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault to come forward and report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has put a number of legislative and practical measures in place to tackle the scourge of sexual assaults. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has significantly enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences. I recently commenced Second Stage of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill which provides for presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sex offenders. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that victims of sexual crimes have appropriate protections during a court process and I have ordered a review of the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences with an emphasis on vulnerable witnesses.  A review group chaired by Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Malley BL, an acknowledged expert in this field, will report to me by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has dedicated very significant resources to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling all crime, including violent crime. Indeed, Budget '19 saw an increase in the Garda budget from &euro;1.65 billion to &euro;1.76 billion, an increase of &euro;110 million.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the National Development Plan and the overall vision in Project Ireland 2040, the Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT which is now an important element of the fight against crime &ndash; this substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in their daily work.  The Budget also provides for a further &euro;10 million investment in the Transport Fleet and &euro;17 million in the Garda Building Programme. This capital investment is a key enabler in the reform programme and will be one of the main pillars on which the future of policing will be built. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  This is underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 21,000 by 2021.</p></reply>

Similarly, the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  With regard to the incident referred to by the Deputy, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner, and was the subject of a High Court order directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it. The removal of individuals from the property was not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed initially and were later supported by a Garda Public Order Unit.</p>  <p>  The execution of High Court orders is not a matter which falls within the remit of the Private Security Authority. The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made under them, and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is solely a matter for the Courts. </p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I understand that this review will include an examination of a particular vehicle involved in the removal of the persons from the premises, as well as any other associated Road Traffic Act offences that might have occurred. The Policing Authority, at its recent meeting, pursued this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. </p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law of the land in what were very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, there has been some disquiet about members of the Public Order Unit wearing hoods.  The Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets and you will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.</p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be targeted in this way.</p></reply>

The supply of scramblers and quad bikes to persons under 16 years of age has been highlighted by my Department as a key issue requiring careful consideration in this regard.  </p>  <p>  As part of my Department's consultations with other Government Departments and agencies, the importance of effective and targeted public awareness-raising has been acknowledged.

The report published by GSOC of its investigation found that there was no conduct by any member of the Garda&iacute; which would constitute an offence.  However, there was conduct that requires further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  That further investigation by GSOC is on-going and I do not propose to comment on that matter while the investigation is proceeding.</p>  <p>  In response to the motion calling for an investigation into Shane O'Farrell's death, the Government, respecting fully the independence of GSOC, proposed that any further action be deferred until the current investigation was completed. I want to reiterate the Government's undertaking that when investigations are completed, the question of what further action might be taken will be considered.</p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning that the D&aacute;il motion also referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the courts.  The Government recognises the failings that occurred in the run up to this tragic incident and GSOC, the independent authority established by an Act of the Oireachtas should be allowed to complete its investigation unhindered. As a consequence, the Department of Justice and Equality is currently considering how the issues around systems, processes and procedures that have been identified in this case, can be best reviewed so that lessons can be learned and that tragedies such as this are avoided, to the greatest extent possible, in the future.</p></reply>

The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference. </p>  <p>  The Report makes many innovative proposals aimed at strengthening our national security arrangements; empowering the Garda Commissioner to ensure more effective management of the Garda organisation; supporting the governance of the Garda organisation through the introduction of a Board and reforming the method of recruitment and training of Garda&iacute;.  It also makes a number of recommendations on external oversight arrangements as well as on the Commissioner&rsquo;s engagement with the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the report has the full support of all members of the Commission notwithstanding two members of the Commission having diverging views in relation to the recommendation concerning the formation of a Board as part of a new governance and oversight architecture for policing. I am grateful to all the members of the Commission for their commitment and dedication to the task. The State  was very fortunate that the members possessed a huge range of personal expertise and clearly people had strong views and felt free to express them. This is all to the good in terms of the robustness of the report's recommendations.  </p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration. My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations. As part of this process, I have asked the Garda  Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  I have also written to the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality and I look forward to hearing their direct response to the Report in the coming weeks. Once this engagement is completed, I will return to Government to discuss my substantive response as well as a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In that context my Department, in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach, is moving quickly to establish the Implementation Group for Policing Reform and Implementation Programme Office as recommended by the Commission.  These matters are being advanced at a senior official level and I expect these structures to be in place in the near future including the appointment of an Independent Chair to lead the Implementation Group.  Given the whole-of-Government reach of the report which envisages a new holistic approach to policing and public safety, this Implementation Group and Programme Office will be based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  </p>  <p>  While the programme of reform that the Commission outlined is undoubtedly an opportunity for transformational change, it is also extremely challenging, requiring actions across Government. It is prudent that we take some time now to ensure that the necessary structures and resources are in place to deliver this needed reform.  It will take time to fully implement the recommendations in the report and the Commission has suggested that the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022 would be an appropriate target for the transformation to be completed. </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment.</p>  <p>  There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme.  20 applications have been approved, with grant aid totalling more than &euro;480,000 already approved, from the total &euro;1 million available for 2018.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p>  <p>  In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General as well as with stakeholders including County and City Management Association (CCMA), Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Irish Rural Link as well as interested community groups.  The application process and documentation were streamlined, compared to the earlier community CCTV grant aid scheme operated by Pobal, on behalf of the Department. Nonetheless and in response to the queries from some groups and local authorities, my officials are further reviewing the relevant documentation and continue to engage on the matter in particular through the LGMA and the CCMA, to clarify any queries arising.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns on the legislative basis for CCTV.  However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV. We expect findings from this process to be of great assistance to local authorities as they carry out their function of data controller.</p>  <p>  As I have said in the past, I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie  and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie  </p></reply>

The report published by GSOC on the outcome of its investigation found that there was no conduct by any member of the Garda&iacute; which would constitute an offence.  However, there was conduct that requires further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  That further investigation by GSOC is on-going and I do not propose to comment on that matter while the investigation is proceeding. As the Deputy is well aware, GSOC is independent and it would be entirely inappropriate of me to comment where I have no authority to do so.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by GSOC that the Senior Investigating Officer in charge of the investigation has outlined that a report into the disciplinary aspect of the GSOC investigation will be submitted to the GSOC Commission as soon as is practicable.  Upon receipt of the report, the GSOC Commission is then obliged under section 97 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 to submit a report to the Garda Commissioner outlining the findings of the GSOC investigation.  It will also contain a recommendation about whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Disciplinary Regulations against any of the Garda members subject of the investigation.</p>  <p>  In response to the motion calling for an investigation into Shane O'Farrell&rsquo;s death, the Government must respect fully the independence of GSOC.  The motion referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the courts.  The Government recognises the failings that occurred in the run up to this tragic incident and GSOC, the independent authority established by an Act of the Oireachtas, should be allowed to complete its investigation unhindered. That being said, it is entirely appropriate that any further or proposed action be deferred until the current investigation is completed.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that the Department of Justice and Equality is considering how the issues around systems, processes and procedures that have been identified in this case, can be best reviewed so that lessons can be learned and that tragedies such as this are avoided, to the greatest extent possible, in the future.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate to the House the Government's undertaking that when investigations are completed, the question of what further action might be taken will be considered.</p></reply>

It is extremely important to me but, more importantly, to victims of this violence that policy must be effective, driven by accurate, up to date, reliable data. Knowledge and information are essential to making effective policies to prevent and combat sexual violence. </p>  <p>  The Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland (SAVI) report was formative research in this area and its results had a significant impact on policy at the time of its publication in 2002 and since. </p>  <p>  The Government decided to examine what data is available for the development of policy in this particularly sensitive area and to assess if there were gaps in the data available for policy formulation. As the Deputy is aware, this work was undertaken by a Scoping Group which considered the availability of data and made recommendations on the format of a study to identify the prevalence of sexual abuse and violence in Ireland today and emerging trends.  The Group completed a draft report and submitted it to my office for consideration in April.</p>  <p>  A further piece of technical legal work is now being completed so that proposals can be brought to Cabinet in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be appreciate I am constrained from  commenting further as proposals  have yet to be brought to Government, but I can assure the Deputy that monies for the undertaking of work have been made available next year.

Part 4 of the Act, which was commenced on 27 March 2017, provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution. The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.

In exercising this function, I understand that the Garda Commissioner continues to ensure that relevant policing developments in other jurisdictions are reviewed on an on-going basis so that international best practice can be identified and, where appropriate, applied throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition I wish to assure the Deputy that when developing policy or legislative proposals on policing matters my Department would always have regard to international models. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort model of resource allocation has been in use by Garda management since 2015 and is currently the model utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The model is a dynamic distribution model and aims to impose a numerical/mathematical measure on the policing needs of each Division nationwide. The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocation of resources is under review, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all relevant factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains provisions, the purpose of which are to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to operate to the best standards in line with the police services of other comparable jurisdictions. The Act provided for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and section 117(1) of the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining and taking account of policing practices in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan to achieve an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve Members and 4,000 civilians. </p>  <p>  To support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.  The Budget also provides for the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties. Since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014, we have been rebuilding the Garda organisation and I am pleased that, since then, approximately 2,200 new Garda members have attested and assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. Garda numbers will increase to approximately 14,000 by the end of this year for the first time since 2011 and are on target to reach 15,000 by 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note one of the functions of the Garda Professional Standards Unit, which was established under Section 24 of the 2005 Act, is to promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, in operational, administrative and management matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It also undertakes reviews, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, into operational, administrative and management matters relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels. Arising from these reviews, the Unit proposes measures to improve performance and promote the highest standards of practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with reference to those of comparable police services. The Garda Commissioner, on an ongoing basis, draws on the Unit's proposals to enhance policing practices and policies.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September. The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference.  The need for digital innovation and information was highlighted by the Commission and I am pleased that funding of around &euro;65 million for ICT is provided for in Budget 2019. This is part of the &euro;1.76 billion allocated to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in  2019 which represents an increase of &euro;110 million on this years allocation. </p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration. My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations. As part of this process, I have asked the Garda  Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  I will return to Government to discuss my substantive response as well as a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders is contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1940 and the Rules of Court made thereunder. Sheriffs (or County Registrars acting as Sheriffs) are officers of the Court and are independent in the exercise of their functions and duties under statute and rules of court.</p>  <p>  The Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1940 also govern the role, function and powers of Court Messengers who support Sheriffs (or County Registrars acting as Sheriffs) in the enforcement of Court Orders. Every Court Messenger when assisting in or executing an execution order is furnished with a warrant in writing authorising the Court Messenger to execute or take part in the execution of the execution order.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of a Court Order is considered on a case-by-case basis and where additional support is required, for example where the Court has granted an Order for possession, the Sheriff (or County Registrar acting as Sheriff) assesses the risks involved and makes his/her recommendations to the bank or lending institution&rsquo;s solicitor as to what additional security arrangements are necessary.  These additional personnel are sourced, contracted and paid for by the bank or lending institution and the Sheriff (or County Registrar acting as Sheriff) then appoints them as bailiffs.  The employment of bailiffs in these circumstances is governed by section 2 of the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, 1924.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the removal of individuals from property is not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In relation to the recent protests referenced by the Deputy I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner who had obtained an injunction order from the High Court directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it.  The action was taken by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order.  </p>  <p>  Operational issues are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I am informed that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to uphold the law in facilitating the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest.  I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed, and were later, based on the situation as it evolved on the ground, supported by a Garda Public Order Unit, to allow the High Court order to be enforced, to keep the peace and to facilitate a public protest.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has made a statement in relation to the protest and I understand he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I also note that the Policing Authority will be discussing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Furthermore, I have asked the Garda authorities to bring any additional relevant information to my attention. </p></reply>

This is an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p>  <p>  In terms of capital investment, &euro;342 million is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies and to deliver on reform.  &euro;46 million is being made available for investment in the Garda Fleet over the same period, in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet from 2013 to 2015.  And further &euro;60 million exchequer funding underpins the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme, which is a 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities benefiting over 30 locations around the country.  This is in addition to the investment of approximately &euro;100 million in development of 3 major new Divisional and Regional Headquarters recently completed and entered into operational use at Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street, Dublin. </p>  <p>  This significant current and capital investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage these resources provided for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to determine the allocation of budgets to all Divisions, including Cavan/Monaghan Division, based upon operational requirements.  In that regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review so as to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  As concerns Cavan/Monaghan Division, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the context of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021, a new Garda station will be constructed in Bailieborough, County Cavan.  I understand that the planning application was lodged in August 2018 and the OPW is currently examining the submissions received in this regard.  It is not possible to give a definitive date for completion of the construction of the new station.  I am informed that in advance of that new development, essential works at the existing station in Bailieborough were completed in 2016, involving enhancements to the public office and safety improvements throughout the building.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. Bawnboy, County Cavan, is included in that pilot and the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to engage in relation to the works required in that regard.</p>  <p>  Finally I am advised by the Garda authorities that the strength of the Garda fleet in the Cavan/Monaghan Division as at 11 October 2018 is 56 vehicles.  I understand that provision has been made to purchase an additional 25 vehicles for the Northern Region in 2018, of which 6 have been allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Division as at 11 October 2018. The allocation of these vehicles within the Division will be determined by Assistant Commissioner for the Northern Region in accordance with operational policing priorities following delivery. </p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with all Ministers, including myself, to address in a joined up manner the many challenges Brexit will present. However, I do want to emphasise that it is this Government&rsquo;s firm intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue into the future.  In its approach to the Brexit negotiations, the Government has ensured that protecting the gains of the Peace Process and the avoidance of a hard border is a high priority for Ireland, our partner Member States and the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates within this policy framework and the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, and Garda management keep this under active review in line with operational and security demands, including any possible policing requirements post Brexit.  A high level management team in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been established to prepare for any organisational challenges that may evolve in the context of Brexit and they are engaged on an on-going basis with my Department.  I and senior officials from my Department met with the Garda Commissioner and his team to discuss Brexit contingency planning and I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is preparing for Brexit with a wide-ranging focus to determine operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, training and technology and will continue to progress their contingency preparations. They are committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising therefrom. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide whatever resources are required to keep our people and our communities safe. This is clearly demonstrated by last week&rsquo;s budget in which the Garda budget increased by &euro;110 million from &euro;1.65 billion to &euro;1.76 billion in 2019. This will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed for the recruitment of up to 800 new Garda&iacute; and for further civilianisation to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.  Up to &euro;95 million is available for the overtime budget of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na next year. The Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT, a further &euro;10 million investment in the Transport Fleet and &euro;17 million in the Building Programme.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the provision of these resources will support all Garda activities, enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to deploy additional resources to meet the challenges of Brexit, should he deem it necessary.</p></reply>

The objective of that provision was to improve the availability of information on sentencing and precedents and thereby to support a more structured approach in relation to sentencing.</p>  <p>  Advice was sought earlier this year from the Office of the Attorney General as to the scope which might exist for strengthening these provisions.  The advice received was to the effect that non-binding sentencing guidelines are constitutionally permissible.  However, there would be constitutional difficulties if guidelines of a binding or statutory nature were to be imposed on the courts in criminal matters.   </p>  <p>  Following on from that advice, a set of amendments aimed at transforming the Sentencing Information Committee into a Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee has been developed within my Department.

Drafting of the Strategy is at an advanced stage and it aims to recognise, acknowledge and respect diversity in Irish society, to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce, and to provide opportunities for people to self-develop and promote their mental, physical, social health and sense of belonging.  </p>  <p>  I am further assured by the Garda Commissioner that he recognises the importance of recruiting into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from a wide cross section of the population so that the organisation provides a policing service that reflects the growing diversity of Irish society. To support this a concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through on-line videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. In the most recent recruitment campaign a series of videos and text were produced in multiple languages including English, Irish, French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. They were published on the Garda Facebook page which has more than 180,000 followers. </p>  <p>  In relation to the proportion of women members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I am informed that the latest figures available indicate that women account for approximately 3,677 Garda members or 27% of the total strength. This compares favourably with the number on 31 December 2008 which was approximately 3,100 or 22% of the total strength. This is broadly in line with other police services in England and Wales. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland published its report on 18 September. One of the Report&rsquo;s key recommendations is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socio-economic, educational and geographical backgrounds.  It also recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake. The Government noted this Report on publication and my Department are currently consulting widely on the issues raised including with the Garda Commissioner in advance of me returning to Government in December with my views on the recommendations and a high level implementation plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-17a.171.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101700072#WRD00400"><p>The Army Pensions Acts 1923-1980 provide for the grant of pensions and gratuities to former members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service (whether at home or abroad) or due to disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Application for a disability pension must be made within a statutory time limit of 1 year after retirement in wound/injury cases, and 8 years in disease cases.</p>  <p>  The criteria for awarding a disability pension or gratuity are based on:</p>  <p>  (a)  whether the applicant is suffering from a permanent disablement due to wound/injury which is attributable to his military service at home or abroad, or to a disease attributable to or aggravated by service with a United Nations Force abroad, and</p>  <p>  (b) the percentage degree of disablement from which the applicant is suffering.</p>  <p>  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body consisting of a chairman and two ordinary members (both doctors). The Chairman and one doctor are civilians and the other member is a serving Army doctor. The Board&rsquo;s principal function is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Acts and to report to the Minister thereon.  The Board determines the question of attributability to military service in each case; assesses the degree of disability; and reports its findings to the Department, which acts on the Board&rsquo;s findings including the grant or refusal of appropriate benefits.  The findings of the Army Pensions Board in regard to &lsquo;attributability&rsquo; are final and conclusive and binding.  However, there is provision for review of awards or refusals subject to certain conditions, for example if additional relevant information has subsequently become available.  </p>  <p>  The Army Pensions Acts essentially constitute a military occupational injuries code which operates separately from, but in addition to, the Defence Forces retirement benefit (superannuation) provisions.  The combination of both pensions is subject to an overall limit.  In a case where both a service (retirement) pension and a disability pension are payable the service (retirement) pension is reduced &ndash; usually by an amount equal to one-half of the smaller of the two pensions &ndash; and the disability pension is payable in full.  A military disability pension is tax-free.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, as amended, provides that any alternative compensation received may be taken into consideration in fixing the level of disability pension or gratuity that might otherwise be awarded for the same injury or medical condition.  The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration compensation paid &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; for the same disablement.  Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the State, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.</p>  <p>  In a case where Section 13(2) applies, the applicant or his/her solicitors are advised of the provisions of Section 13(2). They are invited to make submissions as to how much, if any of the compensation should be taken into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  The Minister then makes a bona fide decision based on a consideration of all the facts of the case.  Each case is considered on the basis of its individual circumstances, which vary widely.  The Minister may decide to take all, some or none of the compensation into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  If the Minister decides to reduce the disability pension under Section 13(2), the reduction applies for the lifetime of the pension.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has requested the number of cases which have subsequently been refused or reduced their pension entitlement.  Unfortunately, such information is not readily available as the relevant legislative provisions have been in place since 1923 and it is not possible to compile such information without incurring significant administrative overheads.  </p>  <p>  I can, however, provide the Deputy with information on the number of personnel who have had their disability pensions reduced under Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act 1923, over recent years.  This information is being compiled and I will write to the Deputy regarding the matter.  </p></reply>

Having participated in both, I am pleased to confirm that the Cork event attracted a strong attendance of over 400 people. The number of attendees in Galway were somewhat affected by the threat of adverse weather conditions on the day but were still close to 200. Both events also attracted significant domestic and international (in particular UK) media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit. </p><p>Costs that have arisen directly so far in connection with the Cork and Galway workshop events and for which invoices/confirmed costings have been received are as follows: <table><tr><th>Item</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>Venue Hire &amp;amp; Related</td><td>&euro;5,069.94</td></tr><tr><td>Event Staging / Audio-Visual Equipment (OPW)</td><td>&euro;35,420.93</td></tr><tr><td>Event Materials / Signage</td><td>&euro;4047.99</td></tr><tr><td>Badging / Registration</td><td>&euro;702.33</td></tr><tr><td>Catering</td><td>&euro;1,387.50</td></tr><tr><td>Photography</td><td>&euro;522.75</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>&euro;47,151.44</td></tr></table></p><p>Two further Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop events will take place in Monaghan and Dublin on 19 and 25 October respectively.

The many partner organisations supported by the Reconciliation Fund include religious organisations and organisations with a strong religious or faith ethos, association or inspiration.</p><p>So far this year, for example, the Reconciliation Fund allocated funds to reconciliation projects undertaken by groups such as the Carryduff Elim Pentecostal Church, the Churches Trust, Corrymeela Community, Dialogue for Diversity, Epworth Methodist Church Bonfire Group, Holycross Retreat Ardoyne, Kilkeel Parish Bridge Association, Newry District Interchurch Forum, Saint Patrick Centre and St Columb&rsquo;s Cathedral.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publishes details of grants on our website at .</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme for overseas development, Irish Aid, provides funding to Misean Cara, a missionary movement which implements projects in more than 50 countries.  Since it was established in 2004, Misean Cara&rsquo;s funding from Irish Aid increased steadily from &euro;12m in 2005 to &euro;20m in 2008.  </p><p>Misean Cara received &euro;16m annually from Irish Aid from 2009 until 2015.</p><p>The annual allocation for 2016 and 2017 was &euro;15.5m. The 2018 allocation is also &euro;15.5m. &euro;10m of this was disbursed in September with the remaining &euro;5.5m to be disbursed later this year.  Irish Aid also provides funding to numerous other NGOs, many of which faith-based, including Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid Ireland, World Vision Ireland and Tearfund Ireland.</p><p>In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) provides funding to not-for-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish. Two such organisations, Crosscare and the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO), both with headquarters in Ireland and under the auspices of religious organisations, receive grants from my Department. </p><p>Crosscare is the Social Support Agency of the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin and provides a range of social care, community and youth work services across the Dublin Archdiocese. The Crosscare Migrant Project, supported through the Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme, provides information, advisory and advocacy services for Irish emigrants and returning emigrants and offers comprehensive pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration.  </p><p>The ICPO provides support to Irish prisoners and their families in Africa, Asia, South and Central America, North America, Europe and Australia.

The Central Bank has indicated that the reviews which have taken place since their introduction have confirmed that the measures are effective, and are contributing to financial and economic stability by reducing the risk of unsustainable lending and borrowing. In particular, when the supply of housing remains below what would be considered optimal given demand factors such as demographic trends and income growth, the absence of such mortgage measures would likely have resulted in more aggressive increases in house prices. </p>  <p>  The measures limit the amount of high loan-to-income (LTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages which can be provided. For principal dwelling mortgages the LTI limit is 3.5. For first-time buyers (FTBs) the LTV limit is 90 per cent, while for second and subsequent buyers (SSBs) the limit is 80 per cent. The limits are proportional, and across the various categories lenders are permitted to issue a certain level of loans above these limits in a prudent manner. Also borrowers who are currently in negative equity and want to move home by purchasing another property are exempt from the LTV limits.</p></reply>

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators. Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.</p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan on the future of VAT on 7 April 2016 which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s pathway for modernising the VAT system, the EU Commission published a proposal on the reform of VAT rates in January 2018. Prior to publication, preliminary details of the proposed changes were discussed as part of the EU Commission&rsquo;s Group on the Future of VAT - a forum for consulting VAT experts from Member States on pre-legislative initiatives. Officials from the Department of Finance contributed to these discussions. With regard to what activity should be subject to a reduced rate of VAT going forward, Ireland specifically recommended to the Commission to include defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment. </p>  <p>  In the course of technical and political discussions on the proposal, Ireland will take the opportunity to continue to recommend that Member States should be able to apply specialised VAT rating to defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment.</p></reply>

Given that there were in excess of 800 schools covered by such amalgamations, and given the time removed since the date of many of these amalgamations, it is not feasible to source individual school records.</p>  <p>  A number of changes to the School Transport Scheme were introduced in Budget 2011, which derived from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme.

It is the case that many teachers who would have been available to carry out substitute work are now gaining permanent and long term contracts. </p>  <p>  In order to ease the situation, in the last school year the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes were suspended. Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, earlier this year the Teacher Supply Steering Group was established. The Steering Group is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. The Steering Group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. The Steering Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables.  In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is supported by a number of working groups which are looking in more detail at the issues under these broad headings.</p>  <p>  At this point the Steering Group and the working groups reporting to it have met on a number of occasions and I hope to be in a position to announce further measures to support teacher supply over the coming period.</p></reply>

This allows for a mainstream allocation of Principal and 1 classroom teacher for the current school year.  </p>  <p>  The letter referred to by the Deputy seeks the appointment of a third teacher to the school for the 2019/20 school year.  The staffing arrangements for the 2019/20 school year have not yet been finalised but will be published in early 2019.  At that point, schools who wish to appeal their staffing allocation may submit a staffing appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.

In exercising this function, I understand that the Garda Commissioner continues to ensure that relevant policing developments in other jurisdictions are reviewed on an on-going basis so that international best practice can be identified and, where appropriate, applied throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, I wish to assure the Deputy that when developing policy or legislative proposals on policing matters my Department would always have regard to international models.</p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community has its own concerns and expectations. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. The term community policing is used in many different ways.  Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  I am advised that An Garda Sioch&aacute;na continue to evaluate and develop Community Policing to take account of the changes taking place within our communities and the need for a more responsive police service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains provisions, the purpose of which are to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to operate to the best standards in line with the police services of other comparable jurisdictions. The Act provides for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and section 117(1) of the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining and taking account of policing practices in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note one of the functions of the Garda Professional Standards Unit, which was established under section 24 of the 2005 Act, is to promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, in operational, administrative and management matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Arising from these reviews, the Unit proposes measures to improve performance and promote the highest standards of practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with reference to those of comparable police services. The Garda Commissioner, on an ongoing basis, draws on the Unit's proposals to enhance policing practices and policies.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland published its report on 18 September.  The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference including in relation to Community Policing.</p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration.  My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations.  As part of this process, I have asked the Garda  Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These recommendations include a particular emphasis on local policing as the core of the future model of policing.</p>  <p>  I will return to Government to discuss my substantive response as well as a High Level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Cohort model of resource allocation has been in use by Garda management since 2015 and is currently the model utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. The model is a dynamic distribution model and aims to impose a numerical/mathematical measure on the policing needs of each Division nationwide. The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel, is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocation of resources is under review, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all relevant factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it has to be factored in that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing. To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p>  <p>  Garda recruitment effectively ended in 2010 and did not resume till September 2014 when the Government reopened the Garda College in Templemore once the economy had stabilised.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since then 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am pleased that the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will reach over 14,000 members by the end of 2018 for the first time in many years.  </p>  <p>  I strongly welcome the funding provided in Budget 2019 for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda recruits next year, along with necessary civilian Garda staff. This ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties following civilianisation of their roles. The net benefit of this is the increased Garda visibility and a greater response to the policing needs of communities in every Garda Division including the Kildare Division.</p>  <p>  The information in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda Station in each Division and the number of new recruits allocated to each Garda Station is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following links, as supplied by the Commissioner.  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/002_Garda_Numbers_by_Division_District_and_Station_2009_to_31_August_2018.xlsx/Files/002_Garda_Numbers_by_Division_District_and_Station_2009_to_31_August_2018.xlsx.</p>  <p>  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/008_Allocation_of_Probationer_Garda&iacute;_by_Division_and_Station_2014_as_on_12_Sept_2018.xlsx.</p>  <p>  Files/008_Allocation_of_Probationer_Garda&iacute;_by_Division_and_Station_2014_as_on_12_Sept_2018.xlsx.</p>  <p>  For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that on an annual basis, approximately 13.5 million vehicle registrations are read by the Automated Number Plate Recognition System, 1.9 million records are exchanged electronically with the Court Services, 9.3 million PULSE searches are conducted, 19.5 million TETRA secure digital radio calls are made and 118,000 fingerprints are searched. </p>  <p>  In terms of investment in Garda ICT, I can confirm to the Deputy that in support of Garda ICT needs and to enable delivery of reform, some &euro;342 million is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  Of that total, funding of around &euro;65 million for ICT is provided for in Budget 2019.   </p>  <p>  The overall Garda budget in 2019 will be &euro;1.76 billion.  It is important to note that decisions in relation to the allocation and management of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a range of ICT equipment is generally available, as required, to operational members on a day to day basis in the terms queried by the Deputy, including desktop PCs and associated IT devices as well as TETRA digital radios. Official laptops and mobile phones may be issued to senior managers and a proportion of operational members depending on business need. Automated Number Plate Recognition technology is available in a number of Garda vehicles.  ICT technology is also deployed in air support units and mobile command vehicles providing on site connectivity to Garda ICT systems and communications.</p>  <p>  There are 565 operational Garda stations in the State, of which I am informed 489 are currently connected to the Garda network.  Options are being explored to provide members attached to the remaining 76 stations not yet networked with local access to Garda ICT services. This includes an assessment of the availability or otherwise of local broadband services and/or the provision of mobile technology.  It is important to note that any member attached to a currently unconnected Garda station can access PULSE at their local district station.  Members attached to non-networked locations can also contact the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) or an associated networked station if required.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a broad range of ICT projects are being progressed to support existing systems and develop them further, with the overall goal of supporting the ongoing business requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all fields. I am further informed that a number of key ICT projects will be moving to implementation phase during 2019, including projects such as: </p>  <p>  -  the Rosters and Duty Management System, which will give supervisors better and faster information on the resources available to them; </p>  <p>  -  phased implementation of the Mobility project, which aims to provide secure mobile access to Garda systems; and</p>  <p>  -  roll-out on a pilot basis of the Investigations Management System, which will standardise, digitise and support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident. </p>  <p>  Finally and as the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September of this year. The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference.  As the Deputy will be aware, the need for digital innovation and information was highlighted by the Commission.  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration.  My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations.  I will return to Government to discuss my substantive response as well as a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  </p>  <p>  The most recent overall figure provided to me by the Commissioner indicates that the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,739 as of 31 August 2018. Since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014, we have been rebuilding the Garda organisation and I am pleased that, since then, approximately 2,200 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. With another attestation due to take place in November, taking account of projected departures, Garda numbers will increase to approximately 14,000 by the end of this year for the first time since 2011. </p>  <p>  To support the Commissioner in this ongoing recruitment, I have secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.  The Budget also provides for the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.</p>  <p>  In addition to the vision of 15,000 Garda members by 2021, plans are also in place for 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserves. I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 August 2018 there were 2,330 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda Siochana. I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, albeit more slowly than anticipated.  It is clear, however, that progress is being made with close to 300 new civilian staff posts sanctioned to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation.  This will allow more Garda&iacute; to focus on operational policing duties where their training and specialist expertise can be put to best use. Already approximately 150 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to operational policing duties and I expect these numbers to accelerate in the coming months and throughout 2019. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September. This innovative report sets out a number of recommendations across the policing sector and in particular on the work of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, including the Garda Reserve. I note that the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland recommends the return of Garda&iacute; to front line policing and the need for visible policing.  My Department has consulted with the Garda Commissioner with regard the recommendations within the Report and I await his proposals including how he will increase the pace of civilianisation and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to mainstream policing duties. </p></reply>

Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities have been and continue to be achieved through these parallel investigations. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also participate in training through CEPOL, Interpol, Europol and actively encourage international police cooperation in the fight against organised crime. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively participate in international seminars that assist in identifying emerging crime trends.</p>  <p>  It is through the work of the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau and the dedicated Drug Units operating across the jurisdiction that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na target those involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  The specific strategies put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include the operation of targeted intelligence-led initiatives. The Divisional Drug Units liaise closely with the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces (Navy). The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also work in partnership with other Law Enforcement Agencies in the area of drugs including the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the National Crime Agency (UK), Europol, Interpol and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N).</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has dedicated very significant resources to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the activities of criminal gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, that seek to target our communities.

Drafting of the Strategy is at an advanced stage and it aims to recognise, acknowledge and respect diversity in Irish society, to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce, and to provide opportunities for people to self-develop and promote their mental, physical, social health and sense of belonging.  </p>  <p>  I am further assured by the Garda Commissioner that he recognises the importance of recruiting into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from a wide cross section of the population so that the organisation provides a policing service that reflects the growing diversity of Irish society. To support this a concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through on-line videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. In the most recent recruitment campaign a series of videos and text were produced in multiple languages including English, Irish, French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. They were published on the Garda Facebook page which has more than 180,000 followers.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proportion of women members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I am informed that the latest figures available indicate that women account for approximately 3,677 Garda members or 27% of the total strength.

One of the Report&rsquo;s key recommendations is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socio-economic, educational and geographical backgrounds.  It also recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake. The Government noted this Report on publication and my Department is currently consulting widely on the issues raised including with the Garda Commissioner in advance of me returning to Government in December with my views on the recommendations and a High Level Implementation Plan. </p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.  </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken. </p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increases the use of curfews, and, where requested by Garda&iacute;, allows for the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.    </p>  <p>  I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on the information sought by the Deputy and I will contact him directly when the report is to hand.   </p></reply>

In this regard I have established a review of the protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences which is under way. The review will examine the adequacy of the mechanisms available in law and practice to protect and support victims of sexual violence through the judicial process. This will include considering practical supports for vulnerable witnesses through the reporting, investigation and trial processes; provision of additional legal supports to witnesses during the court processes and measures in place to protect vulnerable witnesses during evidence, including the use of measures such as pre-recorded evidence or video-link. Any considerations of this nature would, of course, need to take into account the rights of an accused person and the balance of justice. </p>  <p>  I have asked Mr. Tom O&rsquo; Malley BL., Senior Lecturer in Law at NUI Galway and member of the Law Reform Commission, to chair the review. I am very grateful to Mr O&rsquo;Malley for agreeing to take on this role and he will bring a wealth of expertise to this issue. The review will form part of the work programme of the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee and the review working group includes representatives of my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service and the Courts Service. </p>  <p>  I have asked that the report of the review be made to me by the end of the year or as soon as possible thereafter. The views and experiences of stakeholders will be considered as part of this review and I myself met with a number of victim support organisations earlier this year to understand where they feel improvements can be made.

As Minister, I have no role in this regard.</p>  <p>  That said, I am informed that the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) continue to review serious cases that remain unsolved. </p>  <p>  There are around ten ongoing SCRT reviews, including a number of high-profile outstanding homicide investigations, such as the Kerry Babies case, a missing persons case in Ashbourne Garda District and the murders of Dessie Fox (1990) and Paul Quinn (2007).  The SCRT is also assisting in the investigation of the missing person case involving Deirdre Jacob, which has recently been re-classified as a murder.  It is intended that a further review by the SCRT of other missing persons cases under Operation Trace will begin shortly, in order to identify and provide investigative assistance to the original investigation teams.</p>  <p>  With regard to resourcing, the Deputy will appreciate that all Garda activities, including the investigation of unsolved cases, will benefit from the very significant investments which have been made in policing resources.  Budget '19 will see an increase in the Garda budget from &euro;1.65 billion to &euro;1.76 billion, an increase of &euro;110 million. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the National Development Plan and the overall vision in Project Ireland 2040, the Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in Garda ICT which is now an important element in the investigation of crime.  </p>  <p>  As reflected in the Programme for Government, the Government is also committed to supporting Garda recruitment through the accelerated recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 21,000 by 2021.</p></reply>

Both operate to the highest standards and their staff are to be commended on their expertise and dedication to the application of science to crime investigation in Ireland over many years. </p>  <p>  The Garda National Technical Bureau provides assistance and technical support in the investigation of crime by conducting forensic examinations of crime scenes and the forensic examination of exhibits from such crime scenes and elsewhere. The Technical Bureau is a modern forensic examination facility with state of the art examination equipment and appropriately trained and qualified expert personnel in the areas of fingerprint examination, ballistic and firearm examination, forensic photography, forensic document and handwriting examination and the mapping of crime scenes. The Bureau has ISO 17025 accreditation.</p>  <p>  FSI offers a broad range of forensic services that includes DNA analysis, drugs identification and quantification methods and physical and chemical analysis techniques. FSI has ISO 17025 accreditation and is a member of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutions (ENFSI).  Many of these techniques are also used by other members of the ENFSI and this network promotes sharing and adoption of best practices across institutes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that construction of a new FSI laboratory at the Backweston campus, Co. Kildare, will commence in the near future, providing a modern, purpose built facility, achieving best practice standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage. </p></reply>

It is imperative that Garda&iacute; are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it would not be appropriate for me to detail the operational measures that the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in these situations. However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken.</p>  <p>  I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) provides explicit statutory protection for peace officers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in relation to offences involving assault to or obstruction of a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty. Section 19 of that Act provides that any person who assaults a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years. </p>  <p>  The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties. The assault and related provisions in that Act apply to assaults on all sectors of our community which of course includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Businesses will first apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Successful applicants will then be able to apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. </p>  <p>  The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. The eligibility criteria have yet to be finalised, but the scheme will be open to SMEs with an establishment or branch in Ireland. Sole traders will be eligible for funding under the scheme. Finance provided under the scheme will be competitively priced and have favourable terms, including the interest rate, with loans up to &euro;500,000 unsecured.       </p>  <p>  The scheme is expected to launch in early 2019.</p></reply>

There are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, with 45% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) jobs created last year based in regional locations. The IDA is focused, as am I, on increasing those numbers further. </p>  <p>  Last year, IDA client companies conducted 18 site visits to County Sligo, two site visits to County Leitrim, three site visits to Roscommon and two site visits to County Donegal. As for the first two quarters of 2018, there have been eight site visits to County Sligo, five visits to County Leitrim, one site visit to Roscommon and three site visits to County Donegal. Site visit activity, it must be remembered, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is working to promote Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal to a range of potential investors, but especially in the areas of global business services, research and innovation and high-tech manufacturing. The IDA also regularly engages - with a view to encouraging job creation and investment - with key stakeholders on the ground in these counties, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of the broader approach to fostering enterprise and job creation in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is also, of course, responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across the country. </p></reply>

The CCPC assesses market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) as it provides an initial indication whether a market seems to be concentrated and could pose a potential competitive concern, where further economic assessment is required.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, HHI can be used by the CCPC when assessing whether mergers and acquisitions are likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in any market for goods or services in the State. HHI can also be used by the CCPC as part of a market study or when assessing potential breaches of competition law as an initial indicator of the levels of competition in a market.

An internal review was also conducted. This final Report combines the two review findings.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the final Report was produced on foot of concerns raised under Protected Disclosures procedures and also concern by ULHG about the increase in detection of CPE in UHL in recent years.</p>  <p>  I note that the Report found that out of a final group of 73 patients in which CPE was detected from February 2009 to May 2017, 8 patient deaths were identified in whom CPE was considered to be a contributory factor. The conclusion of the external review, however, which ULHG has accepted, was that no deaths were a direct result of CPE acquisition. All 8 patients had serious underlying diseases and co-morbidity factors.  In addition, of the remaining 65 deceased patients, the external reviewer concluded that CPE was found not to have been an associative factor in their deaths.</p>  <p>  This is an important finding and will inform the work already ongoing in my Department and the HSE to tackle healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance (HCAI/AMR). </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that since the first outbreak of CPE in a group of patients at UHL in 2011, the Hospital Group has been active in screening for CPE. ULHG have advised that they limited its spread within the hospital through enhanced 'cohorting' or isolating of patients known to be carriers of or those infected with this bacteria.  Screening protocols have been in place at UHL for a number of years and indeed have been used as a template for the development of the national screening policy for CPE, published in February 2018. Measures taken by the ULHG over the past three years include the refurbishment of an inpatient ward at UHL to facilitate an Infection Prevention and Control (IP&amp;C) isolation ward; a second ward at UHL has also been refurbished. The new Emergency Department which opened at UHL in May 2017 was designed with IP&amp;C in mind and has facilitated the management of relevant patients in en-suite isolation rooms. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding to expand the HSE HCAI/AMR National Team and Implementation Leads to progress work on HCAIs/AMR across the HSE, including Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. My Department has also provided funding for additional capacity in IP&amp;C and laboratory services. This includes new posts for University Hospital Limerick. </p>  <p>  I have been assured that ULHG have measures in place to appropriately support and manage patient care needs in line with national and international best practice.</p></reply>

The purpose of the facility is to provide a clean, safe, healthcare environment where people who inject drugs can access medical and social services from healthcare professionals. Evidence from countries with such facilities shows that they are cost-effective in the long-run, through reducing ill-health for injecting drug users and by improving the environment for residents and businesses. </p>  <p>  In February 2018 the HSE announced Merchants Quay Project as the preferred bidder to operate a supervised injecting facility in Dublin city on a pilot basis. The awarding of the contract followed a HSE procurement process initiated in August 2017 and is subject to normal planning permission approval. The Department of Health and the HSE have been proactive in supporting Merchants Quay Ireland to develop this facility and have met with a number of key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the establishment of the supervised injecting facility. Only recently, on 14 September, I visited Merchants Quay Ireland to launch its annual review 2017 and to get an update on progress on establishing the SIF. During the visit, I announced the establishment of a community fund to support improvements in the physical and social environment, so that there are tangible gains for the local community arising from the SIF. </p>  <p>  I understand that Merchants Quay Ireland lodged an application for planning permission to establish a supervised injecting facility with Dublin City Council on 8 October, 2018. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the outcome of the planning process.  </p></reply>

Screening tests are a balance of sensitivity and specificity and therefore include both false negative and false positive results which could affect the screening outcome and treatment of a person who may or who may not have a disease. False negatives are those samples where the slide was originally reported as negative but on review abnormal cells are found. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the report of the Scoping Inquiry, some screening programmes divide those false negatives into one of two groups:</p>  <p>  1. Abnormalities that most screeners would not have detected;</p>  <p>  2. Abnormalities that most screeners would have detected.</p>  <p>  It is often a matter for professional judgement and discussion into which of these two groups any single false negative will fit.  I again emphasise that false negatives are unavoidable and happen in every screening programme.  </p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry, led by Dr Gabriel Scally, reported in September. Its terms of reference, developed following cross-party engagement, included examination of the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services since the inception of the CervicalCheck programme. Dr Scally's report was the result of a period of intensive work which included visits to the contracted laboratories. Dr Scally is clear in his report that the Inquiry is satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck. Crucially, he has confirmed that there is no reason, on quality grounds, why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV testing regime has been introduced. This provides welcome reassurance for women in Ireland about the quality of these services. </p>  <p>  Dr Scally has undertaken to carry out a supplementary report into certain further aspects of the laboratories, including accreditation. He has also made a number of key recommendations in relation to laboratory services which I intend to implement and which will help to ensure that the cervical screening programme meets the highest possible standards.</p></reply>

The primary focus has been on the staffing, infrastructural and IT requirements that will arise in the context of the implementation of greatly increased Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) controls at ports and airports on an East-West basis. </p><p>Depending on the shape of the final deal these requirements are likely to be significant, and will arise in respect of the import of live animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin from the UK into Ireland and the EU once the UK has become a third country. There are also likely to be significant export certification requirements in relation to the export of such products to the UK, although this is a matter for the UK authorities.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have made provision in my Department&rsquo;s estimate for 2019 for the commencement of a phased process of recruitment of additional staff to carry out the greatly increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit. An amount of &euro;4 million has been set aside for this purpose, with a further initial provision in 2019 of just over &euro;3 million to address ICT hardware and software requirements. Further expenditure is planned in these areas in 2020 and 2021, with full-year staffing costs from 2021 estimated to be of the order of &euro;28 million. </p><p>This phased recruitment involves the recruitment of up to 116 staff for SPS and fisheries controls in 2019, as agreed by Government on 18 September. The necessary arrangements to commence this recruitment process are currently being put in place. New positions will be advertised through the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>The Department is also feeding intensively into the wider ongoing process around the infrastructural requirements at ports and airports, and will continue to liaise closely with the Office of Public Works, in particular, in this regard.  </p><p>I announced the following Brexit measures in Budget 2019 :<table><tr><th>Amount</th><th>Support to</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;44  million</td><td>Direct aid to farmers through additional spending of &euro;23 million on the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme, the introduction of a &euro;20 million Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot Scheme and additional funding of &euro;1 million for the horticulture sector.</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;27 million</td><td>Brexit-related supports for the food industry, comprising &euro;13 million in supports for competitiveness and innovation, an additional &euro;5 million in funding for Bord Bia, &euro;6 million to progress the National Food Innovation Hub in Teagasc Moorepark, and &euro;3 million for artisan and micro food and beverage programmes.</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;7 million</td><td>To support Brexit preparedness work within my Department, namely, to meet the staffing and IT costs associated with the additional import control and export certification requirements arising from Brexit.  </td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am pleased to see that this engagement and the delivery of last year&rsquo;s Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme have acted as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new products for the sector, including:</p>  <p>  - A recently announced initiative by one of the main banks mirrors the Scheme in offering a discounted interest rate with extended and flexible repayment terms. </p>  <p>  - All three main banks have dedicated offerings in response to the current situation. </p>  <p>  - Co-ops have introduced recent initiatives on credit facilities for their suppliers.</p>  <p>  A Spending Review of the Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme, published with the Budget, concluded that this was one of the main outcomes of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  In the context of these new and improved supports in this area, the focus of the Government has been to address market gaps, the most critical of which has been identified as unsecured longer-term investment finance. In his Budget speech my colleague the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe TD, formally announced progress in relation to the development of the &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs, including the primary agriculture and seafood sectors. As I announced on Budget day, this is the Scheme for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018. This is a key Government Brexit response that has been under consideration and development throughout 2018.</p>  <p>  Further details will be provided in the coming months.  The Scheme is expected to be in place in early 2019 and will run for three years from its launch date.  </p></reply>

My Department and I have ongoing liaison with the Minister and his Department on matters relating to agriculture. This year the Departments collaborated on the Progress Implementation Update of the Agri-taxation Review 2014, which is available at the following link: h.</p><p>This shows the excellent progress made over recent Budgets with the implementation of almost all of the 25 recommendations of the Agri-taxation Review. This has resulted in positive changes for Irish agriculture, especially in the areas of land mobility and succession. The Update shows that taxation support to the sector averaged &euro;930 million per annum in the years 2012 to 2016, of which an average of &euro;240million per annum was in taxation measures exclusively available to farmers. The Update also includes a comprehensive economic evaluation of an income stabilisation measure. </p><p>An additional income stabilisation measure was not introduced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2019. However, income averaging is a very useful tool in successfully managing volatility, and I was pleased that Minister Donohoe and I could agree to the lifting of the restriction whereby farmers with additional self-employed income could not participate. This will make income averaging available to significantly more farmers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-17a.519.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101700077#WRJ05800"><p>Since 2013 Government investment of over &euro;325m has been provided by my Department to drive demand and increase the depth of retrofit being carried out through home energy grant schemes operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. To date 375,000 homes across Ireland have carried out energy efficiency upgrades under these schemes.</p>  <p>  A number of actions which are outlined in the National Mitigation Plan and Long Term Renovation Strategy are already underway to achieve the levels of retrofit outlined in the National Development Plan and to further promote deep retrofit of buildings across all building types and tenure. Those actions which relate specifically to homes are as follows: </p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. </p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. </p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Communities scheme allows groups of buildings to apply for funding to improve their energy efficiency. </p>  <p>  To build on what has been achieved through these schemes, and understand how we make the step change necessary to achieve the NDP ambition, we are already gathering additional evidence through two pilot projects, both of which follow international best practice:</p>  <p>  - The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme, which began in 2017 and will conclude at the end of 2019, is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit. This will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.</p>  <p>  - The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, funded by my Department, is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health, and is operated by SEAI and the HSE. It began in 2016 and this first phase will conclude at the end of this year. It is measuring the health and wellbeing impacts associated with improved energy efficiency. Not only is this evidence needed to make a robust business case for further public investment, it is critical for how we communicate the benefits of climate action. Increasing public understanding of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency is critical to motivate people to invest in, and make their contribution to, action on climate change.</p>  <p>  Government funding of approximately &euro;116 million was also provided, by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government, from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes. This was Phase 1 of the social housing retrofit programme and focused on the lower-cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation. In addition, energy efficiency measures have been carried out in over 9,000 vacant houses that have been returned to use since 2014. This effectively means that approximately 50% of the social housing stock has already undergone a level of energy retrofit. Phase 2 will commence shortly and will target higher-cost and higher impact measures such as external insulation and replacement of single-glazed windows. Approximately 30% of the social housing stock, or 40,000 homes are more than 40 years old and will be the main priority for phase 2. The ambition is to achieve a BER B standard for these homes. The timeline will be determined by the funding available over the coming years.</p>  <p>  These measures continue to build demand for energy efficiency and grow the supply chain. In parallel, Ireland's building regulations continue to strengthen energy performance requirements in buildings. </p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as required by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010/31/EU), have introduced new requirements for home renovation which are proposed to come into force on 1 April 2019.  This will mean that where buildings are undergoing a renovation of more than 25% of the surface of the building envelope, the entire building will have to be brought up to a higher energy performance standard. The Directive also requires that all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) by 31 December 2020.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area, and is now evaluating the Final Tender submission received from the remaining bidder on 18 September 2018. On conclusion of the evaluation, my Department will make a recommendation to me on whether to appoint the bidder as preferred bidder and I will bring the matter to Government for decision.</p><p>Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. Approximately 175,000 of the committed premises have been passed as of Q2 2018.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

This staff complement has significant experience in developing and implementing climate and energy policy at international, EU, national, regional and local levels. In addition to its own staff, the Department also has access to scientific and technical advice in agencies under its aegis to assist it in delivering the Government&rsquo;s climate policy objectives.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation and annual publication of official inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions, and for reporting this data to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Oireachtas receives a summary of the most recent inventory and projections prepared by the EPA each year in the Annual Transition Statement.</p>  <p>  The EPA also provides a range of expert scientific and technical advice on climate change to the Government. The EPA supports the Department in representing Ireland at relevant meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EPA also undertakes a number of climate-related research and awareness activities, including the provision of support for the delivery of activities under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. The EPA also produces, in accordance with its statutory mandate, a quadrennial State of the Environment Report which provides an integrated assessment of the overall quality of Ireland's environment, the pressures being placed on it and the societal responses to current and emerging environmental issues. The last such report was published in 2016, includes a specific focus on climate change, and is available from the EPA&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Department is also supported in the delivery of its policy objectives for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed inter alia by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers. </p>  <p>  SEAI had a total of 88 staff as at the end of the June 2018. EPA had a total of 384 staff at that time. While it is difficult to fully disaggregate the number of EPA staff working on climate issues, the EPA estimate this at 32.</p>  <p>  The work of both EPA and SEAI inform, in turn, the wider work of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group, which provides the overall framework for the provision of technical capacity to Government Departments for climate action policy development and implementation. </p>  <p>  TRAM was established on foot of a Government Decision in 2015 and its membership comprises technical experts from relevant Government Departments and Agencies.  In addition, representatives of externally contracted bodies providing modelling and analytical support may participate in TRAM meetings. To date, these services have been provided by ESRI, UCC, UCD and EnvEcon. TRAM is chaired at Assistant Secretary level in my Department and reports to the Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which is chaired at ministerial level. </p>  <p>  TRAM performs a number of functions in support of climate, air and energy policy development processes for this Department and for a number of other Government Departments and Agencies:</p>  <p>  - implementation of a rolling work programme of technical analysis and research required, inter alia, in order to further the process of identifying the most cost effective transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy in the context of climate, air and energy policy;</p>  <p>  - provision of a clearing house for the development of climate, air and energy policy in other related technical areas such as the EU ETS, air quality, and the application of fiscal instruments;</p>  <p>  - acting as a focal point for technical information flow between relevant Government Departments and Agencies on issues of a technical and economic nature; and </p>  <p>  - providing a resource for the engagement of the necessary external expertise to undertake the modelling, analysis and research required. </p>  <p>  The climate-related work of the Department is also supported by the climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which comprises a website www.climateireland.ie  and other resources to assist with climate adaptation planning in Ireland. Climate Ireland was originally developed under the EPA research programme on Climate Change and the EPA currently manages the operational platform with expert support from six staff members in the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI), based in UCC.  The platform provides decision makers with a one stop repository of climate specific information, data and knowledge to support planning for the impacts and consequences of climate change and supports the Department through their work with the key sectors in preparing sectoral adaptation plans as required under the National Adaptation Framework. The Climate Ireland team also play a pivotal role in helping to build capacity and knowledge of climate related matters across all the sectors including Local Government and it is fully intended that Climate Ireland will continue to function as a long-term operational support for climate action in Ireland.</p></reply>

The group meets on a quarterly basis and provides progress updates on the actions and measures committed to under the Plan itself. This group, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, chaired by An Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  Technical capacity for climate action policy development and implementation is provided through the Technical Research and Modelling Group (TRAM), which was established by Government Decision in 2015 and is chaired by my Department. TRAM is a high level cross-departmental technical group, with representation from relevant Government Departments and Agencies and reports to the Climate Action High Level Steering Group as well as to the Senior Officials Group to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Significant TRAM outputs are generally published on my Department&rsquo;s website  and these have helped to inform ongoing policy development, including that of the National Mitigation Plan. As the Deputy will appreciate, given the business of an inter-Departmental working group such as this, there are also a number of ongoing outputs from TRAM which are either not in the nature of formal studies or are part of ongoing policy development processes and are therefore not published by the Department. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan through the same structures described above. Preparation of this Plan has in turn been informed by work already undertaken to prepare the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, the National Adaptation Framework, and the National Development Plan (NDP). </p>  <p>  In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, as well as other relevant Ministers, provide an oral report to each House. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. I expect to be in position to lay the 2018 Annual Transition Statement before the Houses shortly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a new Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action has also been established by the Oireachtas to take forward consideration of the third report and recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly entitled &lsquo;How the State can make Ireland a Leader in tackling Climate Change&rsquo; and to report to the Houses by the end of January 2019. A number of representatives of Government Departments and Agencies as well as a number of other organisations have met the Committee to assist it in its work.</p>  <p>  In relation to the National Development Plan, the governance aspects of this are in the first instance a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As I understand, a high-level Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board has been established and is jointly chaired by the Secretaries-General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to provide strategic direction and leadership to both the NDP and the National Planning Framework implementation process.  </p></reply>

In relation to carbon tax, the Minister&rsquo;s letter re-stated the Government&rsquo;s commitment, through the National Mitigation Plan, to an ongoing role for carbon pricing as a core element of the suite of policy measures to address and reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time, and noted that review of the carbon tax, which has been commissioned from the ESRI by the Department of Finance, should provide a robust basis for the Government to provide a clear long-term signal on the future evolution of carbon taxation in Ireland. Specifically, this would ensure that the carbon tax is able to perform its core function of driving changes, over the longer term, in business and household behaviour. The correspondence also noted the recommendation of the Climate Change Advisory Council, contained in its 2018 Annual Review, that a commitment could be made to have a carbon tax rate of not less than &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.</p></reply>

It is also open to community groups working alongside their Local Authority/State Agency to develop a Greenway proposal, but the final application must be made by the Local Authority or State Agency.  Projects that have clarity regarding access to the land on which the Greenway will be built as well as having planning permission in place, or that are expected to have planning permission in place in the near future, will be well placed to secure funding. </p>  <p>  The question of further rounds of funding will depend on the quality of the applications received in this round. Funding will be awarded to projects that are assessed as best meeting the criteria laid out in the Strategy. If not enough quality applications are received and not all of the funding available is allocated, then further calls may be issued. However, this is a long term strategy and, in the context of future capital plans, I will be seeking further funding for Greenways for the years beyond 2021.</p></reply>

This will form part of Project Ireland 2040. PLUTO 2040 will be an update to my Department's 'Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport' (SIFLT), published in 2015. It will focus explicitly on how to ensure the realisation of the National Strategic Objectives set out in the National Planning Framework, taking account of the investment plans in the National Development Plan. For ease of reference, I include a link to SIFLT here:</p><p>As was done for the SIFLT, the analysis conducted for PLUTO 2040 will be published in the form of a number of background papers focusing on specific issues. Staff in my Department are currently developing these background papers, and I expect them to be completed early in 2019. I will ensure that, when they are completed, they will be made available to the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p><p>The development of PLUTO 2040 is overseen by a steering group composed of officials in my Department, officials in my Department's national transport agencies, and officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. PLUTO 2040 will be subject to a full public consultation upon completion of a draft report. Again I expect this take place in early 2019.</p><p>PLUTO 2040 will not identify specific transport investment projects for investment. Rather, it will set out key priorities and principles for future investment to ensure the delivery of a transport network that meets the needs of our country, and which delivers the National Strategic Objectives of Project Ireland 2040. These priorities and principles will then be utilised, by national agencies and Local Authorities, to identify specific projects. These projects will be subject to the processes set out in the Public Spending Code and the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes, both of which require the identification and appraisal of climate impacts. Following the completion of PLUTO 2040, my Department will consider any necessary updates to the Common Appraisal Framework, including with regard to the appraisal of climate impacts.</p></reply>

A lot of consideration has been given by the Steering Group, as well as by Departmental officials and other stakeholders, to the best approach to deliver on this objective.</p>  <p>  The consensus was that the best way to proceed was through the development of a small number of well-planned pilot schemes that take a holistic approach to encouraging people to live in town centres.  </p>  <p>  The initiative which I announced will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which are appropriate to towns of different sizes and in different locations.  The learnings from this pilot will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p>  <p>  The towns who have been selected for the pilot initiative are: Boyle, Co. Roscommon; Callan, Co. Kilkenny; Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo; Banagher, Co. Offaly; Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan; and Cappoquin, Co Waterford.</p>  <p>  These towns were identified through consultation and meetings with a number of Local Authorities who made contact directly with my Department expressing an interest in becoming involved in the initiative, or towns which would provide a good mix of size and location for the pilot.</p>  <p>  Each of the pilot towns will now develop proposals which they feel are important to increase the number of people living in their centres.  Each relevant Local Authority will receive technical assistance of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department to progress the pilots.  </p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide an opportunity to take the emerging ideas to implementation stage, if they prove to be effective.</p></reply>

As the employers, these sponsoring organisations contract with my Department, on an annual basis, to provide job seekers and other vulnerable groups with good quality work experience and training qualifications to support their progression into employment.</p>  <p>  Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware these concerns were raised and are being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.  </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out on the pensions issue with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issues relate to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

In advance of this, on the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  </p>  <p>  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The level of contribution and the types of development to which development contributions will apply, including any waivers or reductions from charging in specific circumstances, are determined at local authority level and in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  In this context, my Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the 2000 Act on the implementation of development contribution schemes and to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions. The 2013 guidelines updated and supplemented non-statutory guidance previously issued to local authorities by my Department by way of Planning Circulars PD 4/2003 and PD 5/2007. </p>  <p>  The 2013 guidelines specifically address the issue of "double charging". All local authorities have been advised that any development contribution already levied and paid in respect of a given development should be deducted from any subsequent charge applied on that development so as to reflect that a contribution has already been paid.   </p>  <p>  Development contributions are levied as conditions attached to planning permissions and are payable prior to commencement of development or as otherwise agreed by the local authority. Local authorities may facilitate the phased payment of contributions, such as when a certain number of housing units are completed or when a particular stage is reached in the development. In this context, planning authorities should ensure that appropriate monitoring and control procedures are in place to prevent any double charging of this nature.</p></reply>
