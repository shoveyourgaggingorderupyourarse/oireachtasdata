For operational and security reasons I am not in a position to give precise figures as to the number of these anti-armour platforms and associated ammunition levels held by the Defence Forces. </p><p>I am advised by the Military Authorities that the principal anti-armour systems in use by the Defence Forces are the SAAB made AT4 Short range anti armour weapon and the Carl Gustav 84mm recoil-less rifle platforms. The Defence Forces also operate the Lockheed Raytheon FGM-148 Javelin system. These are all shoulder fired systems operated by dismounted infantry.</p><p>Regarding artillery platforms I am advised that the Defence Forces do not operate heavy artillery platforms. The largest systems used by the Defence Forces comprise of the L118/119 105mm light gun/howitzer and the M87 120mm mortar system. Both of these non-automated systems are towed platforms and provide fire support with the aid of an integrated fire control system.</p><p>I am advised that sufficient stocks of ammunition needed for these platforms are retained by the Defence Forces to meet both training and contingent needs on-island and operational requirements overseas. In this context, the Defence Forces operate a robust stock control system to ensure that ammunition levels are maintained with fresh units being acquired as and when necessary<s>.</s></p><p>As such I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a sufficient amount of modern and effective anti-armour and artillery systems and associated ammunition to enable it to fulfil its assigned roles and taskings.</p><p>I am aware from general media and public comment regarding the potential dispatch of anti-armour munitions to Ukraine from stocks held by the Defence Forces. After serious consideration the Government has decided not to send such munitions nor indeed any other lethal aid equipment to Ukraine. Ireland remains fully aligned to its long standing position regarding military neutrality. Ireland is contributing to the European Peace Facility fund to enable non lethal equipment to be promptly sent to Ukraine. The Government is also funding humanitarian assistance.</p></reply>

The assessments indicated a broad range of security challenges that were facing this state. The assessment was that a conventional military attack on this state although possible, was unlikely. The White Paper update (2019) stated that &ldquo;the threats in the cyber domain, and from espionage, have been assessed as increasing since 2015 while the wider political global environment is now more complex and uncertain.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The White Paper is clear that security challenges are such, that no single country can deal with these alone. The White Paper outlines the importance of the UN and EU in collective security and commits Ireland to fully supporting UN mandated peace support operations. As such the policy position has been that Ireland would maintain military capabilities which would enable the Defence Forces to fully contribute to UN mandated peace support operations, meet domestic security and civil support requirements, whilst also retaining capabilities for certain contingencies. </p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge there is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks. That is precisely why the Programme for Government contained a commitment to establish an independent Commission on the Defence Forces and why I moved quickly to establish the Commission. Current events are also prompting increased open debate and consideration of our defence requirements.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report, which was recently published, contains many detailed recommendations and there is a process underway to consider these recommendations. This necessarily requires consultation with Ministerial colleagues. As I have previously outlined, I am also keen to hear broader views on the findings and recommendations contained in the report and I will be engaging further on this, over the coming period. </p>  <p>  The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me at this time to pre-empt an ongoing deliberative process. </p></reply>

Thus, for 2022, the total gross allocation provided to the Defence Vote Group, as set out in Budget 2022, is &euro;1,107 million, comprising of &euro;836 million for Vote 36 (Defence) and &euro;271 million for Vote 35 (Army Pensions).</p>  <p>  Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure. To this end, the National Development Plan has allocated multi-annual funding of &euro;566 million to Defence out to 2025, with an allocation of &euro;141 million per annum provided for 2022 and 2023 and &euro;142 million per annum for 2024 and 2025. In recent years, pay savings have also been reallocated for investment in military equipment. With the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, should pay savings arise in the future, the Department will, where possible, reallocate them towards further investment in military equipment and infrastructure. Many of the military equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times, so the funding certainty now provided by the National Development Plan is welcome, as it will enable the Department and the Defence Forces to plan, prioritise and deliver on scheduled projects over the coming years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was recently published. There is a process underway to consider the many detailed recommendations in that report. This necessarily requires consultation with Ministerial colleagues. The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.

With regard to defence spending domestically, Government policy is determined within the parameters of our national budgetary process and role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's participation in Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), Ireland has committed to regularly increase our defence budgets in real terms in order to reach agreed objectives. This is a commitment to be met over the medium term. The PESCO notification states clearly that PESCO does not prejudice the security and defence policy of the member states; that the member states remain sovereign; and that the commitments will be implemented fully in accordance with the Treaty, its protocols and the constitutional provisions of the Member States. This clear acknowledgement includes PESCO commitments made in relation to defence spending.</p>  <p>  Ireland contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations through the European Peace Facility (EPF). The EPF, established in March 2021, replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP). The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility, as well as Assistance Measures in order to provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations. </p>  <p>  The European Council agreed in 2021, has a &euro;5bn (&euro;5.7bn in cirrent prices) financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure, such as the recent examples of the EPF Assistance Measures in support of Ukraine. An annual ceiling for each of the seven years is set out in the Council Decision establishing the EPF.</p>  <p>  Any calls for increased funding for defence will in the first instance be for national defence spending and for national ministries to decide, but there may yet be concrete proposals for increased EU spending on defence. We will look at those proposals if and when they are tabled. We alone continue to decide on defence investment and deployment of our Defence Forces. The budgetary process and role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann remains unchanged. </p>  <p>  Ireland is Constitutionally prohibited from participation in an EU common defence. The legally binding Irish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, ratified by the twenty-eighth amendment to the Constitution, provides that any decision to move to a common defence will require a unanimous decision of the European Council.  It would be a matter for the Member States, including Ireland, to decide, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and with their respective constitutional requirements, whether or not to adopt a common defence. </p>  <p>  The European Union does not itself possess a military force. EU Battlegroups are multinational, military units which form part of the European Union's military rapid reaction capacity. Member States choose whether to participate and in which Battlegroup to seek to participate. At EU level, their deployment is subject to a unanimous decision by the Council and any Irish deployment with an EU Battlegroup is subject to our own triple lock mechanism. The Strategic Compass includes a proposal for a Rapid Deployment Capacity. While Ireland remains broadly supportive of the concept discussions on the existing Battle Group Concept are still ongoing and it is my view that the result of these discussions should inform any development of this new concept.</p>  <p>  The French government has not presented specific proposals on European Union military integration or to increase military spending at EU level.</p></reply>

The recommendations arising from the review requires consideration from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to implications on costs and pensions. </p>  <p>  In December 2021, I secured agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which allows for an extension in service limits for Privates and Corporals, who were recruited to the Permanent Defence Force since 1 January 1994, to remain in service up to 50 years of age, subject to them meeting certain criteria including medical and fitness standards. </p>  <p>  In addition, I also secured arrangements that will facilitate the extension of service limits of Sergeants recruited to the Permanent Defence Force since 1994. Details in relation to the proposal for Sergeants will be finalised following further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. There will also be discussions with PDFORRA, the representative association for enlisted personnel on this matter. </p>  <p>  The other recommendations in the civil/military review, which includes service limits Commissioned Officers and for senior Non-Commissioned Officer ranks, will be considered in the forum of an Inter-Departmental Working Group, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established, to consider mandatory retirement ages and service limits for public service groups who have fast accrual pension arrangements.  </p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 has now been signed into law, which serves to update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the Permanent Defence Force. </p><p>On foot of the enactment of the Defence Amendment Act, I gave a commitment to liaise with the Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) on the issue of employment protection for RDF members who might be engaged in voluntary military service in support of the PDF going forward.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that engagement at official level with DETE on this matter has been initiated with a view to identifying the most appropriate steps.  This matter will require careful consideration and will ultimately also involve an open and honest dialogue with employer bodies. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to comment further pending the outcome of these initial discussions at official level. </p><p>In addition as the Deputy will be aware, the Report of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, published on 9 February 2022,  includes proposals on the role and contribution of the RDF. There is a process underway to consider these recommendations in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and stakeholders.

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence 2015. The White Paper sets out that the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons. </p>  <p>  I would note, however, that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is the home of the National Cyber Security Centre which is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision. </p>  <p>  With regard to the National Cyber Security Strategy, my Department officials and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in its implementation. This Strategy, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area. This includes work to develop an updated, detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyber-attacks and the secondment of a member of the Defence Forces to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. My officials were also part of the steering group that developed a Baseline Cyber Security Standard for Government Departments and Agencies and they participate in the UK-Ireland Critical National Infrastructure Cyber Cooperation Working Group.  My officials actively participate on the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing the overall  implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to provide support in the area of national cyber security. The overall aim is to improve the cyber security of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised, including the ongoing sharing of information and analyses of risks. </p></reply>

At this meeting, discussions focused on the current situation in Ukraine, following Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military invasion and the efforts already underway in terms of support to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF) Assistance Measures.</p>  <p>  A package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine was  agreed by EU Member States. This is split between two separate EPF assistance measures, focusing respectively on (i) supplies not designed to deliver lethal force, such as personal protective equipment, first aid kits and fuel to a total value of &euro;50 million and (ii) a lethal assistance component, valued at &euro;450 million. Ireland's contribution, which will be provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs, will be exclsuively towards the first measure for non-lethal assistance.</p>  <p>  Prior to this, an Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers took place in Brest, France on 12 and 13 of January. At this meeting, a working dinner attended by representatives of NATO and the UN took place on the topic of &ldquo;interferences and actions of state and non-state actors in our operational theatres&rdquo;. Following a short presentation on Current Affairs a working session was held on &ldquo;Safeguarding the EU&rsquo;s strategic interests in contested domains: focus on outer space&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  A joint meeting of both EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Defence took place over a Working Lunch to discuss the first revision of the draft Strategic Compass text. At this session, Ministers provided their first reactions to the revised text with a view to providing guidance for further work within the Council. Ireland welcomed the progress on the Strategic Compass as set out in the revised draft and urged a continued emphasis on multilateralism and the importance of the EU-UN strategic relationship. Discussions on the Strategic Compass are continuing at official level in Brussels. EU Foreign and Defence Ministers are expected to resume their consideration of the text on 21 March in Brussels.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Agency provides access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.  This is important in terms of Ireland's ability to participate in UN-mandated Peacekeeping Operations.  Ireland contributes, on an annual basis, to the operational budget of the EDA.  The financial commitment to this budget is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on gross national income (GNI) key.  Since 2017, Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;3.3m, this includes contributions to the operational budget and also to the capability development projects in which Ireland has or is participating. </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Council endorsed the modalities to establish the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).  This is a process which aims to create greater transparency by sharing Member States information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment.  All 27 EU Member States, including Ireland, participate and contribute to the CARD process. There is no financial requirement to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the CARD.</p>  <p>  Ireland joined the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in 2017.  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Under PESCO, Member States come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Ireland is currently participating in one PESCO project and is an observer on a further nine projects.  To date, no additional costs have been incurred through PESCO-related activities other than costs associated with attendance by Defence Forces Subject Matter Experts at PESCO project planning meetings. Ireland is currently a participant in one PESCO project and an observer on a further none projects.</p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in The EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen) since 2007. The EU SatCen is an Agency working for the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union under the Political Supervision of the Political and Security Committee and the Operational Direction of the High Representative, which is governed by a Council Joint Action. In the international security and defence field, it handles sensitive and classified data to support CSDP military operations and civilian missions.  The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs contribute to the budget of the EU SatCen.  Since 2017, the total contribution to the budget of the SatCen by Ireland is &euro;1.1m.    </p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for Common Security Defence Policy operations. The fund is designed to foster innovation to address new security and defence challenges and allow economies of scale through greater industrial and research cooperation and enhancing the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The EDF is funded within the Multiannual Financial Framework which itself is funded directly by the Exchequer.  Member State contributions to the EU Budget (Own Resources) are currently calculated annually by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resources Decision (ORD) Regulation.  As Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF, there is no defined cost to the Exchequer for the EDF.        </p>  <p>  Ireland contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations through the European Peace Facility (EPF). The EPF, established in March 2021, replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP). The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility, as well as Assistance Measures in order to provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations.  In 2020, the European Council agreed a &euro;5bn financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure, such as the recent examples of the EPF Assistance Measures in support of Ukraine. An annual ceiling for each of the seven years is set out in the Council Decision establishing the EPF. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the common costs of EU missions and operations via the Athena mechanism was approximately &euro;730,000, in 2018 it was approximately &euro;1.1m, in 2019 &euro;1m, in 2020 &euro;1.7m and in 2021, the first year of the European Peace Facility, &euro;2.1m. The 2021 figure of &euro;2.1m was reduced to a spend of &euro;1.9m in practical terms by a credit note of approximately &euro;220,000 due to a surplus from the previous year.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to EU Assistance Measures under the EPF is currently funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p></reply>

It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.   </p>  <p>  The White Paper, in addressing Air Corps capability, provided for the replacement of the Cessnas and Casa 235 fleets.  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role providing a substantially increased capability with their state of the art surveillance technology.   A further Pilatus PC-12 was also procured arising from the demands of Covid.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s was signed with Airbus in 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  These C295s are larger and more capable aircraft than those they replace and will enable the Air Corps to conduct maritime patrols and surveillance across Ireland's area of maritime interest, with enhanced capabilities.</p>  <p>  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was published on the 9th February 2022.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  There is now a process underway to consider these recommendations.  The intent is to revert to  Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will note the strong emphasis by the EU on diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the current situation in Ukraine.  Ireland strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a position I have repeatedly reaffirmed at the UN Security Council meetings on Ukraine and in EU meetings.  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and at the UN to shape a collective response, and has supported the adoption of a package of sanctions on Russia, some of the hardest sanctions the EU has ever imposed.  </p></reply>

The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt this deliberative process in advance of Government consideration. </p><p>My Department formally recognises two veterans associations which represent all former personnel -&Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann (ONE), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, and the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA). My Department and I engage on an ongoing basis with these associations. </p><p>A suite of services are provided by the Department of Defence to the associations. My Department has entered into service level agreements with both ONE and IUNVA, which provide for an annual grant to be paid to each to assist with their administrative overheads. As a further means of assistance, my Department has secured total funding of &euro;500,000 under the Dormant Accounts Fund to assist ONE and IUNVA with specific special projects. Almost &euro;300,000 was spent in 2021 while the remainder will be used to fund further special projects in 2022. </p><p>On 3 October 2021, I officially opened ONE's new residential home which can accommodate 5 retired members of the Defence Forces, incorporating a new Veterans Support Centre in Cobh, Co. Cork. This building was refurbished with  funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund. IUNVA has used funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2021 to pay for the development of a new United Nations museum at its headquarters in Mount Temple Road, Dublin 7. Other funding was used to purchase IT equipment for IUNVA posts.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with the commitment in the current Programme for Government, my Department continues to facilitate, where possible, the establishment of ONE Veterans Support Centres (VSCs) around the country. VSCs are available to all veterans to seek support and advice, not just to ONE members. On 29 November 2021, I officially opened the new building housing the Defence Forces Personnel Support Service and ONE's Veterans Support Centre at Campfield, Collins Barracks, Cork. This project was funded by my Department and replaced a temporary Veterans Support Centre in the Cork Barracks.</p><p>My Department and I continue to work closely with the recognised veterans associations. </p></reply>

However, we will pay our full share (approx &euro;10 million) and our funding will go to non-lethal elements such as the provision of additional equipment in terms of personal protection equipment and material support for the armed forces of Ukraine.  The provision of this funding will allow the EU to quickly respond to the Ukrainian request and responds to a specific ask from the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p>We are continuing to provide strong political and practical support for Ukraine and my officials in both the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs continue to engage in all discussions on the matter as required.</p><p>In addition, the Taoiseach announced over the weekend that the government will provide a further &euro;10 million in humanitarian aid, adding to the &euro;10 million agreed last week.</p><p>Moreover, Ireland has already lifted the visa requirement for Ukrainians wishing to travel to Ireland.</p></reply>

The EDP is based on a rigorous prioritised examination of the range of equipment requirements to deliver on roles and associated capabilities. Prioritisation must take account of the immediacy of any operational demand as well as planning, specification, procurement, production and delivery time-frames and relevant resourcing. </p>  <p>  At any one time, there will be a balance of what is feasible within available funding and what is needed taking account of equipment life-cycles and the needs of on-going and contingent requirements. The overall priorities in the EDP remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability. I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces operate many different types of air defence equipment. </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, the Air Corps use surface search radar on the CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft and all aircraft are fitted with a transponder and the automatic identification system (AIS) for identification and tracking. As outlined in the White Paper, the Air Corps's PC 9 aircraft provide a very limited air to air and air to ground capacity. </p>  <p>  The programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Naval Service use maritime surface search radar and the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) systems for surveillance and tracking. </p>  <p>  Existing capabilities available to the Army include radar systems such as the Giraffe Mk4 short-range air defence system and the RBS 70 Surface to Air Missile, which has been upgraded with BOLIDE missiles.  Other capabilities include the Browning Heavy Machine Gun and the General Purpose Machine Gun which can be used in various roles including anti-aircraft. For operational security reasons, I am not in a position to outline further details of these equipment platforms held by the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020.

Thus, for 2022, the total gross allocation provided to the Defence Vote Group, as set out in Budget 2022, is &euro;1,107 million, comprising of &euro;836 million for Vote 36 (Defence) and &euro;271 million for Vote 35 (Army Pensions).  Funding for 2023 will set out in Budget 2023.</p>  <p>  Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure. To this end, the National Development Plan has allocated multi-annual funding of &euro;566 million to Defence out to 2025, with an allocation of &euro;141 million per annum provided for 2022 and 2023 and &euro;142 million per annum for 2024 and 2025. Many of the Defence Equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times, so the funding certainty now provided by the National Development Plan is welcome, as it will enable the Department and the Defence Forces to plan, prioritise and deliver on scheduled projects over the coming years.</p></reply>

The main day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</p><p>On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. </p><p>The Naval Service has nine ships. Two ships, L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Eithne, are currently in operational reserve but can be called upon for surge operations in times of national emergency, as was the case when L&Eacute; Eithne was deployed to Cork City in 2020 in support of Operation Fortitude and the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. L&Eacute; Eithne acted as a forward logistics base and training platform in support of the HSE. Of the remaining seven ships, one is in the process of a mid-life re-fit which is expected to last 18 - 24 months. There are six ships currently available for operations at present.</p><p>At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships  that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies.</p><p>The operational patrol profile of the ships cannot be discussed in detail due to the security implications to ongoing operations, however, Naval Operations Command operate a rotating patrol schedule to maintain a constant presence in the Irish EEZ.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel (MRV). The MRV, is an important element of the Defence Equipment Development Plan and is provided for in the Government's National Development Plan as a major capital project. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.</p><p>Projects for other vessel replacements, such as the replacement of the Coastal Patrol Vessels, the L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall Equipment Development Plan process. These ships will be replaced with similar sized vessels with countermine and counter-IED capabilities. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Commission on the Defence Forces recently published their report on the 9th February 2022. The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference. The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations. The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. </p><p>It is anticipated that this process will take at least four to five months in order to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the Commission have set out.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding current challenges being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p></reply>

The latest draft of the Strategic Compass sets out an analysis of the strategic environment and, in particular, the security and defence challenges faced by the EU, including emerging threats, the increasingly contested multipolar world and the strategic implications for the EU. The recent invasion of Ukraine shows the value of having such a strategic document.</p>  <p>  A first draft of the Compass document was presented to Foreign and Defence Ministers on 15 November 2021 . The draft followed on from several months of discussions at both political and official level, including during a &ldquo;strategic dialogue&rdquo; phase, which also saw the exchange and signature of numerous non-papers by Member States.  A revised version was subsequently presented in January with a second revised version presented in February, each incorporating Member State suggested amendments and capturing recent events. A third revised version issued this week and is currently being discussed.</p>  <p>  Officials from both the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs continue to work closely together on Ireland&rsquo;s input to the Strategic Compass. Ireland&rsquo;s full engagement in work on the Compass has been reflected in our co-signature of non-papers during the dialogue phase covering broad areas of the Compass&rsquo;s work including Partnerships, Crisis Management, and Civilian CSDP. We  also produced a paper on Force Generation, which presents a practical solution to the manpower issues faced by military CSDP missions. My officials continue to attend all relevant working group and other meetings to discuss the text of the Strategic Compass ahead of its planned adoption later this month.</p>  <p>  Negotiations are continuing with discussions expected to take place on the third revised version this week, culminating at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March with the European Council expected to endorse the final product at its meeting on 24 March.</p></reply>

The current development of draft specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish is part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum review and redevelopment.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA has developed draft L1 and L2 curriculum specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish. The L1 specification is aimed at students in Irish medium schools including native speakers, while the L2 specification is aimed at students in English medium schools where Irish is taught as a second language. Under the draft proposals schools participating in the Gaeltacht recognition scheme will be required to provide at least the L1 specification and English medium schools will have the option of providing the L1 and/or the L2 specification, depending on the needs of students. </p>  <p>  The model of curricular provision provided for in the draft specifications reflects the provision made for Irish in Irish-medium (L1)  and in English-medium (L2) schools at primary and junior cycle levels, and provides learners with continuity in their Irish language learning experience, addressing their language learning needs as they progress along their Irish language learning journey in specific settings.   </p>  <p>  In response to concerns raised and requests made by some education stakeholders the NCCA extended the timeframe for the consultation on the Leaving Certificate Irish specifications from the end of August to the end of November 2021, in order to facilitate greater stakeholder engagement in the process. To support stakeholder participation, the NCCA employed a wide range of consultation tools including an online survey, bilateral and focus group meetings and written submissions. This extension of the closing date has also allowed the NCCA to commence an early enactment review of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 and L2 subject specifications.</p>  <p>  The NCCA awarded a tender to the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) to analyse responses to the consultation. NUIG are analysing feedback from two aspects of the consultation, namely the online survey and written submissions. This work will be completed in April. It will then be combined with feedback from the three other aspects of the consultation, namely focus groups, bilateral meetings and interviews with teachers, to form the consultation report on the draft specifications L1 and L2 for Leaving Certificate Irish. It is anticipated that a draft report will be available for consideration before the end of this academic year. Consistent with all other consultations conducted by the NCCA, the report will be published on their website following its approval by the NCCA Council.</p></reply>

Along with these preventative actions, ventilation further reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools.</p><p>To date in excess of 42,000 monitors have been dispatched to schools nationwide. Moreover the Department continues to consider requests for additional CO2 monitors. </p><p>The CO2 monitors provided to schools are portable which allows schools to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>As noted in the published guidance by the Department in May 2021, &ldquo;<b>What you need to know about your school&rsquo;s new carbon dioxide (CO</b><b><sub>2</sub></b><b>) monitors&rdquo;, </b>The monitor can provide information to occupants to indicate levels of poor ventilation. Both the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers and the Air infiltration and Ventilation Centre advise that CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations above 1400 &ndash; 1500 ppm are likely to be indicative of poor ventilation and therefore require ventilation to be increased by opening windows, doors etc.  </p><p>As you may be aware Deputy, to provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. </p><p>Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. </p><p>Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p><p>In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p></reply>

It is recognised that schools play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses and users. The co-operation between schools and local sporting organisations in applying for sports grants is one example of this.</p><p>The policy of my Department is to support the use of school premises and facilities for community, recreational, education-related and other relevant purposes where possible. </p><p>My Department is engaging with local authorities in respect of county development plans which are currently being put in place. As part of this process my Department is commited to working closely with the local authorities where there are opportunities to develop social and community infrastructure. Where possible, this may lead to the development of schools in conjunction with local sporting and other community facilities.</p><p>In 2017 guidance, which was developed in consultation with school authorities, on the use of school buildings outside of school hours was published.

Schools in deciding to make their facilities available have to consider a number of factors, such as indemnity, insurance, drafting of legal licensing agreements, logistical and operational matters. </p><p>Where the proposed use is of a commercial nature such as can occur in pre-school or after-school arrangements the school has to further ensure that the process for applications is transparent, has clear criteria set for the assessment of applications and publishes locally and/or via the school&rsquo;s website that the school will accept applications for the use of their facilities in certain circumstances.</p><p>My Department plans to undertake a review of these guidelines in the third quarter of 2022. The purpose of this review is to identify measures which may further encourage schools to make their facilities available for community, recreational and educational uses.</p><p>As part of this review process my Department will consult with relevant stakeholders, including representatives of schools and other government Departments which engage with the community and voluntary sectors.</p><p>My Department will also undertake a survey of schools as part of this review to obtain information on the current use of school facilities for community, recreational and other uses, their experience in making their facilities available since the guidelines were published and to identify any further measures that would assist schools in making their facilities available.</p></reply>

The scheme supports students with a diverse range of special educational needs.  It allow students who have special educational needs that interfere with their capacity to engage with the standard examination arrangements to demonstrate what they know and can do, without compromising the integrity of the assessment. In common with similar schemes which operate in other jurisdictions, the focus of the RACE scheme is on the need to remove examination access barriers, while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies, and to apply the same standards of achievement as apply to all other students. </p>  <p>  In order that the examinations system continues to be fair to all students and to be operated with integrity, reasonable accommodations can only be provided in accordance with the principles and requirements of the scheme, to eligible students based on the level of need of the student and the accommodation-specific eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  The SEC recognises the role of Assistive Technology in enabling independent access to the examinations by students who are eligible for RACE. The main forms of Assistive Technologies available to students under the scheme are:</p>  <p>   - Word processors, laptops or tablets; </p>  <p>  - Recording devices; </p>  <p>  - Examination reading pens which convert text to speech; and </p>  <p>  - Provision of Digital Coursework Booklets in a wide range of Leaving Certificate subjects to students eligible to use a laptop/word processor/tablet. </p>  <p>   The SEC is also open to receiving applications for use of Assistive Technologies other than those I have mentioned. Such applications are decided upon by the SEC, having due consideration to a number of factors. These include the candidate&rsquo;s normal way of working; examinations integrity; the overhead of developing test instruments in alternative formats; and the principles and requirements of the RACE Scheme. </p>  <p>  The RACE scheme was comprehensively reviewed from the 2017 examinations, following a review process initiated by the Board of the SEC and in consultation with stakeholders. The scheme is subject to further review in the context of reform at Senior Cycle. A priority in the next phase of review will be increasing the use of Assistive Technology to enhance access and integrity and to further support independent learning.  </p>  <p>  Outside of the RACE Scheme, since 2018, second assessment components in new Leaving Certificate subjects have been designed for digital completion. Digital coursework is available to all students taking the subjects Politics and Society, Physical Education, Computer Science, Economics and Agricultural Science. The subject Design and Communications Graphics features coursework that is completed using Computer Aided Design. Consideration is being given to migrating to the digital completion and submission of the coursework reports in History, Geography and Religious Education for all Leaving Certificate students.</p></reply>

Members of the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association (IASTA) were represented on the NCCA&rsquo;s Subject Development Group set up to develop the new specification.</p><p>Officials from my Department and from the NCCA met with IASTA in early 2021 where some concerns of IASTA regarding aspects of the new specification were discussed.  Following this meeting, IASTA later attended a meeting of an 'Agricultural Science in Practice Group' which was convened by the NCCA.</p><p>The purpose of the 'Agricultural Science in Practice Group' is to act as a forum that can be used to generate and collate early insights and authentic examples from practice of Agricultural Science as it is enacted in classrooms, and to publish these in an NCCA document.</p><p>A further meeting of the group took place last month, on 9 February. This meeting was due to take place earlier but this was not possible for reasons related to Covid-19. </p><p>A variety of areas were discussed at the most recent meeting. These included the adoption of non-linear teaching approaches, using the eight cross-cutting themes in the specification to bring together learning outcomes and specified practical activities, and building on the investigative and report writing skills that students are now bringing with them from the new Junior Cycle Science specification.</p><p>The NCCA have acknowledged the professionalism and commitment of the teachers who have shared their practice in the group. The group is due to meet again in May.</p><p>I would also like to advise the Deputy that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) published an Information Note in relation to the completion of the Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science Individual Investigative Study 2022. In light of the ongoing Covid-19 related circumstances for the 2022 cohort of candidates, the SEC introduced Additional Flexibilities to the arrangements for the completion of the Study.  The study accounts for 25% of the total marks for the subject. In addition, further adjustments to the Agricultural Science examination papers published by the SEC last month provide increased choice to candidates through the inclusion of additional questions, and a reduced number of questions which candidates are required to complete.</p></reply>

It is recognised that schools play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses and users. In 2017 guidance, which was developed in consultation with school authorities, on the use of school buildings outside of school hours was published. </p>  <p>  This guidance includes information which school authorities should consider in the event that they receive an application for the use of their school in connection with a pre-school. Where that proposed use may take place within schools hours consideration has to be given to the impact on the capacity of the school to meet its requirements including special education provision. Therefore where a school is considering the letting of part of its property as a pre-school or creche they must first seek the approval of the Minister. In addition, where schools enter agreements for the use of their facilities it should include a condition that the agreement may be terminated should the facility be required for education provision.</p>  <p>  A copy of this guidance is available on my Department's website. My Department plans to undertake a review of these guidelines. As part of this review process my Department will consult with relevant stakeholders, including representatives of schools and other government Departments.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting, be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. It is important that all children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.    The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. </p>  <p>  The Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s policy is that students with special education needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. In circumstances where students with special education needs require more specialised interventions a continuum of education provision extends including access to special school or special class places. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible for planning and coordinating special education provision at both a local and a national level and advising my Department in this regard.  In recent years my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year </p>  <p>  Through this alignment and integration of NCSE and Departmental planning and forecasting processes at both national and local level, my Department works to ensure that specialist education places come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. The active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.</p>  <p>  The planning process involves the NCSE establishing current and anticipated demand for special education provision locally and nationally. Through its local network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (or SENOs), the NCSE establishes demand for special classes on an ongoing basis at a local level. The local SENO engages with parents, local schools, HSE officials and other stakeholders to determine demand. </p>  <p>  Additionally, short, medium and long term planning is undertaken at national and regional level based on projected future population demographics and the average percentage of school going population requiring special class places.  The future population demographics is linked with my Department&rsquo;s demographic analysis of future mainstream school place requirements, thereby enabling an integrated approach.</p>  <p>  The information gathered by the NCSE at a local level on demand for special education placements is collated at a national level to identify areas of potential unmet demand. This in turn informs the long term forecasting of demand for such provision, over a rolling 5 year period, which in turn facilitates planning for special education placements in special classes and special schools.  </p>  <p>  Utilising all this information, the NCSE and my Department work closely to plan how best to address this identified unmet demand in those areas in an integrated way, such as utilising suitable existing or new accommodation, as well as the resourcing requirements for schools.  This is an ongoing process, with forecasts being continually updated to ensure that special education provision is put in place when and where required.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department&rsquo;s more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 301 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  However, the NCSE has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class or special school placements.  My Department will continue to work closely with them in this regard.</p></reply>

Typically, two classrooms for pupils with special education needs are provided in new primary schools and four classrooms are provided in new 1,000 pupil post primary schools, with pro-rata provision for schools of other sizes.  The overall accommodation suite for students with special education needs would also generally include ancillary accommodation such as a Central Activities Space, Multi Activity Room and Quiet Spaces as well as an outdoor Secure Play Area and Sensory Garden. </p>  <p>  In addition to the specific accommodation provision for students with special education needs, the principles of universal design are embedded in all of my Department's technical guidance for school building projects, for the benefit of all school building users.  A suite of such Technical Guidance Documents is published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie. </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term. </p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius College, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Cobh.</p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in Cork and in particular East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in the East Cork area, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that principals of schools in a number of School Planning Areas in Cork have had meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  My Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and school authorities where appropriate to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required. For example, as a result of meetings of schools in Fermoy, my Department has recently approved funding to allow for additional classrooms to be provided for St. Colman's College for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current building projects in Cork to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements for the coming academic year and into the future. </p>  <p>  Details on the current status of all ongoing major projects as well as those projects proceeding under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme in Cork may be viewed on my Department's website and this is updated regularly. </p></reply>

A second subject is expected to be introduced from September 2022.  In addition the department has provided a package of supports for each of the five post-primary schools located on islands to help address their unique sociolinguistic context.  The Department is currently developing a new policy on Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council carried out a review of the Standards for Initial Teacher Education and new C&eacute;im: Standards were published in November 2020.   In addition, contracts for two new Irish-medium teacher education programmes were awarded in 2018 and a new Irish-medium blended-learning post-graduate programme being developed for post-primary teachers is expected to become available from September 2023.</p>  <p>  A new integrated Irish/English Primary Language Curriculum from infants to sixth class was introduced in 2019 and continues to be supported by a comprehensive CPD programme for teachers.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed L1 and L2 draft curriculum specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. Consultation on the draft specifications ran from February to end November 2021.   A detailed analysis of all feedback is now being carried out and an interim consultation report will be published before the end of the academic year.  The NCCA is also initiating an early enactment review of Junior Cycle Irish, L1 and L2 and a report in this regard will be published in 2022.</p>  <p>  The implementation of a Content Language Integrated Learning pilot project in Early Years settings, Primary and Post-primary schools was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but work continued on development of necessary resources.  The pilot programme will now be implemented this year.   In addition, following a review, new circulars for Primary and Post Primary schools on exemptions from the study of Irish are being implemented since September 2019 and an initial   review of implementation of these circulars is currently underway. </p>  <p>  The Department provides funding to support a number of programmes including the Gaelbhratach programme, the digitisation of S&eacute;ide&aacute;n S&iacute; books, a portal dedicated to providing access to resources that support learning and teaching in Gaeltacht and Irish-medium schools, and expansion of the Campa&iacute; Samhraidh/Summer Camp programme in 2020 to include all DEIS primary schools with an associated CPD programme.  The Department published Indicators of Good Practice in Immersion Education: Draft Guide for Gaeltacht Post-Primary Schools in 2018 in collaboration with COGG and further work was carried out with a new edition in 2020</p>  <p>  The Department developed an Online Patronage Process System to provide objective information to parents, which allows them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools.  A number of Gaelscoileanna and four new Irish medium primary schools have been established following such patronage processes. At post-primary level, a new gaelchol&aacute;site was established in 2020, following the transition of an Aonad to stand-alone school.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030. </p></reply>

It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement. My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools. This resulted in 945 schools participating in the overall programme, a rise of 72% over 2021. 24,656 pupils participated in the 2021 school-based programme, an increase of 85% over 2020.</p>  <p>  A home-based summer programme continued to be available for children with complex needs where their schools are not providing a school based programme. A total of 13,321 students availed of the home-based programme, an increase of 35% on 2020.</p>  <p>  Overall, 37,977 pupils participated in the 2021 summer programme across both home and school-based elements, which represented an increase of 65% on participation in the 2020 programme.</p>  <p>  Planning work for the 2022 summer programme is ongoing and my Department will be consulting with education partners in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie.</p>  <p>  which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p>  <p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. </p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research</p>  <p>  on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.   </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.  </p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p></reply>

Specialist advice or assistance from a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address any ventilation issues.</p>  <p>  Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p>  <p>  A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p>  <p>  To date 23 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 13 have been approved, 1 was returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 3 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 4 are currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team. None of the 13 approved identified a need for an air filter.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

In this respect the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires the principal of a recognised school to maintain records of the attendance or non-attendance on each school day of each student enrolled in that school which is reported to Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) receives notifications of all absences from school in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. TESS is very aware that some students will be absent for Covid-19-related reasons. Absences are reported to TESS as explained and unexplained, and together they make up the cumulative number of days marked absent. This has remained the reporting requirement throughout COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Daily school attendance data is collected and held at local school level. School attendance data is  collected by Tusla at the aggregated level through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Absence Report (SAR). Any child who misses 20 school days must be reported to Tusla by law, however this may not result in any intervention, particularly if the absences are explained. Where schools have a concern about a child&rsquo;s attendance they are required to make a referral to TESS Education Welfare Service. TESS views all school attendance referrals from a child welfare perspective with the intention of finding solutions that will enable and support students to attend, participate and be retained in education.</p></reply>

In terms of the area specifically referenced by the Deputy, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special education placements for students with autism in Cork. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Minister Foley and I have secured a significant expansion of special school provision in Cork for the current school year and beyond. This includes the establishment of a new special school in Carrigaline as well as increasing capacity in other special schools to meet the needs of students in the Cork area. </p><p>There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.Of the 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level including 21 Early Intervention classes and 81 are at post primary level. A total of 45 new special classes have been established in Cork for the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with NCSE and the network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that every support will be made available to progress additional special class and school capacity, in the shortest possible timeframe, with a particular focus in Cork on the 2022/23 school-year.</p></reply>

In a similar fashion to 2020 and 2021, the planning work for the state examinations 2022 has been greatly assisted by the advisory group on planning for state examinations, whose membership includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school management. </p>  <p>  Having heard the views of the members of the advisory group, and following consideration of this matter by Government, I announced on 1 February the decision:</p>  <p>  -  To operate an examinations only approach in 2022;</p>  <p>  -  To make further significant changes to the examinations themselves; </p>  <p>  -  To provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021.</p>  <p>  Further adjustments have been announced to the Leaving Certificate examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021. These adjustments mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination.</p>  <p>  I also confirmed the waiving of the fees for the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations.</p>  <p>  The approach I announced on 1 February is designed to address the core concerns of students and their families, while ensuring the approach is consistent to the general return to normality in our society and protects the integrity of our examinations system for the future. </p>  <p>  The examination will not, however, be a traditional Leaving Certificate examination, in view of the very significant changes made to the examination papers to take account of the disruption to their learning experienced by students, and the commitment that the overall results of the examination will not be lower than 2021.</p>  <p>  I also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p>  <p>  The website also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in the Department, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students. These are available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/af24b-wellbeing-guidance-documents-for-parents-students-and-schools/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/publication/0722b-wellbeing-resources/.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. Throughout the negotiations it has been important to consider both the potential costs of any proposal for the exchequer and also in terms of the potential consequences of any agreement for the many other similarly funded roles throughout the public sector.</p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, Secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. </p></reply>

Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement. My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  </p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. Throughout the negotiations it has been important to consider both the potential costs of any proposal for the exchequer and also in terms of the potential consequences of any agreement for the many other similarly funded roles throughout the public sector.</p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, Secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. </p></reply>

However, my Department has a key role in supporting quality within the sector and works closely with DCEDIY.   </p>  <p>  My Department has also historically funded a number of pre-school services in schools in areas at particular risk of disadvantage and social exclusion.  Outside of these initiatives, schools themselves are free to decide if they wish to make their facilities available for the running of early learning and care and/or school-age childcare services, and my Department understands that some schools do so. Any decision to make school facilities available lies with the relevant Trustees/ Property owners having regard to the requirements of the school, staff and students.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to support the use of school premises and facilities for community, recreational, education-related and other relevant purposes where possible. It is recognised that schools play an important role in their wider communities and many schools make their facilities available outside of school hours for a variety of different uses and users. In 2017 guidance, which was developed in consultation with school authorities, on the use of school buildings outside of school hours was published. </p>  <p>  This guidance includes information which school authorities should consider in the event that they receive an application for the use of their school in connection with a pre-school. Where that proposed use may take place within schools hours consideration has to be given to the impact on the capacity of the school to meet its requirements including special education provision. Therefore where a school is considering the letting of part of its property as a pre-school or creche they must first seek the approval of the Minister. In addition, where schools enter agreements for the use of their facilities it should include a condition that the agreement may be terminated should the facility be required for education provision.</p>  <p>  A copy of this guidance is available on my Department's website. My Department plans to undertake a review of these guidelines. As part of this review process my Department will consult with relevant stakeholders, including representatives of schools and other government Departments.</p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum. </p>  <p>  My Department operates the Schools Broadband Programme at an annual cost of some &euro;13m, with at least 98% of schools included in this scheme providing connectivity to these schools through a range of technologies at the best level of connectivity available based on local infrastructure. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area Plan for which implementation is now underway with the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in that area is to be accelerated for delivery. My Department is engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the intervention area implementation, including the Schools Broadband Connection Points Programme. Under the Schools Broadband Programme over 100 of those schools have been provided with high speed broadband through the NBI roll out, with almost 100 to be connected shortly. The two Departments will continue to work closely to provide high speed connectivity to the balance of schools in the National Broadband Plan intervention area.</p>  <p>  My Department is now implementing a project to provide high speed broadband connectivity through the Schools Broadband Programme for primary schools outside of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area, and where commercial provision is neither available nor planned. That project is supported by funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and is managed by HEAnet on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) has been developed by the Government so that Ireland can access funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility. Ireland is expected to receive &euro;988 million in grants under the Facility.

The model involves a satellite/Dundalk-based campus of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta&rsquo;s Balbriggan Gaelchol&aacute;iste &ndash; Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara.</p>  <p>  This pilot offers parents in Dundalk a new choice for Irish-medium provision, in addition to existing provision provided by schools in the area. The learning from the pilot may assist in the potential development of an enduring policy/approach for the application of this model elsewhere, subject to successful review. </p>  <p>  The patron of Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara deferred the opening of the Dundalk campus from September 2021 to September 2022.  Putting in place the necessary accommodation arrangements for September 2022 has been devolved to the school patron.</p>  <p>  Planning for the development of a new policy for Irish-medium education outside the Gaeltacht is now underway in my Department.  This policy will be part of the overall framework of the 20-year Strategy for the Irish language 2010-2030 and will build on the achievements of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. The Policy will be an important step towards achieving the Programme for Government commitments on Irish-language education.</p>  <p>  An intradepartmental working group has been established in my Department to progress this work.  This working group will focus on developing a consultation process to encourage widespread stakeholder engagement to inform the policy. A review of national and international literature will also be carried out. A Steering Group is being established also to provide oversight, guidance and support for the policy development process. Two composite reports on inspection findings on the quality of educational provision in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, covering the period 2017 to 2020, were published in spring 2021.

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 additional special classes, providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of County Tipperary, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools.  Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.</p><p>There is currently a network of 95 special classes in Tipperary of which 72 are special classes for students with autism.Of these, 24 classes catering for students with autism are attached to mainstream schools in South Tipperary - 12 are at primary level including 2 Early Intervention classes and 12 are at post primary level. A total of 4 new special classes have been established in South Tipperary for the 2021/2022 school year, 2 at primary level and 2 at post primary level. </p><p>There are also 8 autism special classes (6 primary and 2 post-primary) in schools in Kilkenny and Waterford, bordering Carrick-on-Suir and which are within a 20 km radius of the town.</p><p>NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. NCSE is looking at local information in relation to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs. </p><p>The NCSE has carried out a review of the requirement for special class places for students with autism for the 2022/23 school year in the South Tipperary region. This included a review of the available accommodation in the Carrick on Suir area and a review of the students known to the NCSE with recommendations for special class places. </p><p>The NCSE is currently aware of four students in the Carrick on Suir area seeking a special class placement and will continue to work with the parents and schools in the area to find a suitable placement for these students.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at ncse.ie/special-classes</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p><p>This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p><p>This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.<b></b></p><p>My Department is aware of the published report referred to by the Deputy, and the recommendations contained therein.

The continued availability of high quality digital content and how digital technologies will continue to support accessibility and inclusion in the school system will form part of the new Strategy.The Department will also continue to fund the provision of broadband connectivity to all schools.  </p>  <p>  Under the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management has responsibility for the direct governance of a school, including developing policies on inclusion, accessibility and technology deployment. Schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to to support the learning needs of their students based on the school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. There is however an extensive range of resources, advices and supports available to schools to help develop policies and practices on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. My Department will work with the National Disability Authority, the body with responsibility for the implementation of S.I. No. 358/2020 - European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) Regulations 2020 (including W3C WCAG 2.1 Standards) referenced in the study to develop appropriate information for schools on this SI.</p>  <p>  It is noted that specific reference is made in the referenced Study to the Department&rsquo;s education portal www.scoilnet.ie and its extensive range of digital content. There are currently in excess of 23,000 curriculum tagged resources available on this portal that can be used by schools and teachers to support teaching and learning.

The identification, delivery and coordination of education services to students, schools and families, are organised and managed through ten teams across five regions. </p>  <p>  SENOs are selected on the basis of their knowledge and experience in providing services to children with disabilities, and also their backgrounds, which include; teaching, nursing, psychology and management.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement. My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.    </p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. </p>  <p>   The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives: </p>  <p>  (i) Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p>  <p>  (ii) Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools. </p>  <p>  (iii) Utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process. </p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted for September 2021 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2022 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.  </p>  <p>  In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable &ndash; generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation. </p>  <p>  There is 4 post primary schools in the Ennis School Planning Area, there is currently 2 schools that have ongoing projects that will increase capacity in both schools. </p>  <p>  Ennis Community College is a multi-denominational co-educational post primary school under the patronage of Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB. The school currently has an enrolment of 532 pupils, a major capital project at the school is nearing completion with an expected handover date of March 2022, on completion the school will have capacity to cater for 750 pupils, creating approximately 218 additional school places.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a project in early stages of architectural planning for Rice College to increase capacity to 1,000 pupils, creating approximately 298 additional school places. The school currently has an enrolment of 702 pupils. The estimated completion date for this project is September 2025. </p>  <p>  It is open to any of the post primary schools in Ennis to submit an application to the Department for interim temporary accommodation should this be required to meet an immediate enrolment need.</p></reply>

It was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.  Formally established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (EPSEN Act), the NCSE now has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. As the visiting teacher service forms part of the NCSE support service for schools, the visiting teachers (VTs) are now recruited, deployed and managed by the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The visiting teachers are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education. They help children to develop tactile and sensory skills and give advice on self-help and other skills needed for independent living. They provide support in the development of pre-Braille skills, where necessary, and give instruction in mobility where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Each VT operates in a particular region and manages a caseload of students. The VT supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. Each VT works in partnership with parents to advise, and offer guidance, in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development. The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>  Currently there are 43 VT&rsquo;s allocated across the 10 NCSE regional teams, supported by teams of professionals and agencies such as audiological scientists, ophthalmology services, speech and language therapists, low vision specialists, psychologists, early intervention teams and school staff.</p></reply>

I also met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis.  I listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders had to say and examined each of their points. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government, I announced on 1 February the decision to operate an examinations approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. </p>  <p>  Further adjustments have been announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, and the detail of these changes have been communicated to schools. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been moved out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities they have regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  Additionally, I confirmed the waiving of the fees for the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. Students will not have to pay the fees which would usually be &euro;116 and &euro;109 for the Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations respectively. </p>  <p>  I believe that the decision announced will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.</p>  <p>The most current information on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate examinations is available online and this includes wellbeing information and supports for students, parents/guardians and school staff. This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in the Department, to support students.  A video will shortly be available on Minding Your Wellbeing that speaks directly to the students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. The Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.</p></reply>

This is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, meaning that students in these schools have been found to have less positive educational outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. There is a strong evidence base in the Irish context that the social class mix of a school matters, in particular in those urban schools with higher levels of children at risk of educational disadvantage which provides a rationale for providing targeted supports to these schools  <b>. </b></p><p>Schools participating in the DEIS programme have seen retention rates to Leaving Certificate improve since the introduction of DEIS - from 80.1% for the 2006 entry cohort to 84.8% for the 2014 entry cohort. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed from a gap of 16.8% for the 2001 entry cohort to approx. 8.6% for the 2014 cohort  <b>. </b></p><p>I was glad yesterday to be able to announce a major expansion of the DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme that will see the programme extended to an additional 310 schools. For the first time since 2017 the DEIS programme is being significantly expanded and eligible schools will now gain access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. In addition 37 existing DEIS schools are being reclassified and eligible for increased supports. This will add an additional &euro;32million to the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p><p>As a result of this announcement from September 2022 1,194 schools will be in the DEIS programme serving over 240,000 students.</p><p>The full list of supports and resources provided to schools in the DEIS programme is available at www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/4018ea-deis-delivering-equality-of-opportunity-in-schools/#supports-to-deis-schools</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  </p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, Secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. </p></reply>

The curriculum contributes to children&rsquo;s overall development by helping them to lead full, active and healthy lives. It provides a balanced range of activities for children through the six strands, of which Aquatics is one. </p>  <p>  The aquatics programme is concerned with gaining competence and confidence near, in, under and on water. The term &lsquo;aquatics&rsquo; includes not only the teaching of swimming strokes but the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play and other aspects of aquatics. The concern for water safety permeates all aquatic activities.</p>  <p>  The PE curriculum has been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, it offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. Many schools, use local facilities, , swimming pools. Access to these facilities is arranged directly by schools.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently reviewing and redeveloping the primary curriculum. The Draft Primary Curriculum Framework was published in February 2020 for consultation. In response to challenges faced by school communities and education stakeholders from Covid the consultation was redesigned. Phase one concluded January 2021 and phase two February 2022. Findings from the consultations will inform the finalisation of the primary curriculum framework. This framework will then guide the development of specifications for each of the curriculum areas. </p></reply>

There are sound educational and pedagogical reasons for the requirement to hold both as this is a complex role which involves both teaching, curriculum design, and guidance counselling and therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of the post-primary sector.</p><p>It is the view of the Department of Education that in order to be able to execute the full range of functions expected of the guidance counsellor in a post-primary school, a person needs to hold both qualifications. Notwithstanding the similarity of some modules in each of the three sector-specific teacher training programmes (primary, post primary, Further Education and Training - FET), teachers qualified to work in the primary or FET  sectors would still require post-primary sector-specific teacher training to be deemed fully qualified to competently work as a post primary teacher / guidance counsellor in a post-primary setting.</p><p>The Department of Education recognises graduates from approved education programmes in guidance counselling to work in educational institutions under the remit of the Department.</p><p>In March 2016 the Department of Education and Skills published a Programme Recognition Framework (PRF). www.gov.ie/en/publication/dce0a0-programme-recognition-framework-guidance-counselling/ </p><p>The PRF sets out criteria and guidelines for providers of education programmes in guidance counselling who intend that their programme graduates will work in guidance services under the remit of the Department.</p><p>The criteria presented in the PRF has drawn on, and been informed by, the knowledge base from within Ireland and beyond. The Department of Education engaged in an extensive consultation process with stakeholders. Submissions received informed the further development and refinement of the PRF. </p><p>The PRF took effect from 2018 and programme providers will continue to need to ensure that their programmes meet the criteria and requirements as presented.</p><p>It is envisaged that the criteria outlined in this document will also inform future decisions by the Department of Education regarding the assessment of applications from individuals holding qualifications in guidance counselling from outside of the State, who intend to work in guidance services under the remit of the Department.</p><p>It remains the case that a person being assigned as a guidance counsellor must be a qualified and registered post-primary teacher with the Teaching Council and, in addition, hold the relevant recognised qualification for school guidance work. <b>Staffing Arrangements in Voluntary Secondary Schools, Community and Comprehensive and ETB schools for the 2021/22 school. Department of Education Circulars 05,06,07/2021</b>.</p><p>The Department of Education has recently established a National Policy Group group (cross-Government) to develop a Lifelong Guidance Strategy, a key recommendation set out in the Indecon review of Career Guidance Tools and Information.  The National Policy Group is chaired by the Department and also  includes in its membership the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>It is expected that in the development of a lifelong Guidance strategy, issues such as the role of the Guidance Counsellor together with appropriate qualifications to work in the various sectors and roles, will be given detailed  consideration. </p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools. This resulted in 945 schools participating in the overall programme, a rise of 72% over 2021. 24,656 pupils participated in the 2021 school-based programme, an increase of 85% over 2020.</p>  <p>  A home-based summer programme continued to be available for children with complex needs where their schools are not providing a school based programme.

Developing knowledge and understanding of, and promoting Traveller culture and history in schools will help build a recognition of the important value of Traveller culture and history to this country and help to improve a sense of belonging for Traveller children in schools.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published a curriculum audit on Traveller history and culture. The audit identified areas across the curriculum where teachers could teach about aspects of Traveller history and culture, and it addressed early years, primary and post-primary. It is available at: ncca.ie/media/4613/travellerculturehistory.pdf</p>  <p>  The audit has provided the basis for further and ongoing work in this area. An expert advisory group has been established by the NCCA to inform the work being carried out, and it includes representatives and members of the Traveller community. A full-time education officer was appointed in September 2020 to progress the next steps, which include:</p>  <p>  - identifying existing initiatives and supports across the three education sectors (early childhood, primary and post-primary) and exploring how they can be further enhanced, supported and possibly replicated;</p>  <p>  - identifying existing resources and materials and exploring the kinds of new support material and resources that need developing;</p>  <p>  - working directly with early childhood settings and schools to identify good practice underpinned by principles of inclusion, intercultural education, and learning about Traveller history and culture.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to collaborate positively and proactively with Traveller representative groups, and to progress a range of actions aimed at improving education outcomes for the Traveller community.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, Secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. </p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website. www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p><p>With regards to the school as outlined in the details supplied, this school has 122.5 SET hours and 4 mainstream SNAs to cater for the educational and care needs of enrolled students.</p><p>The NCSE have advised that the school submitted an application for exceptional review of SNA support: 08/11/2021.  On 8/12/21, the school was advised that no increase would be given.  </p><p>The school have the option to appeal the outcome or make a new SNA Exceptional Review application if there is new information on emerging care needs. </p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

NEPS works through the Department of Education&rsquo;s Continuum of Support framework. NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to school principals and teachers in relation to individual students&rsquo; needs and in the development of whole-school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.</p>  <p>  In addition, NEPS psychologists support schools to implement early-intervention and prevention programmes, such as The Incredible Years Programme in primary schools and resilience-building programmes, such as the FRIENDS Programmes at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the model for allocating special education teacher to schools was introduced for all mainstream primary and post-primary schools in 2017, and updated in 2019. It is designed to distribute teaching resources fairly to schools, taking the needs of each school into account, as indicated by a set of key data indicators. The model provides all schools with a baseline teaching allocation to assist current and future pupils with learning and literacy difficulties, including those arising from English Additional Language (EAL) needs. </p>  <p>  In primary schools, standardised test scores, on which part of the profile is based, reflects where pupils have literacy problems. In post-primary schools, Junior Certificate examination data in English and mathematics represent literacy and numeracy achievement scores and have been applied in a graduated manner to create a value for each school. The profiled allocation therefore takes account of a school&rsquo;s literacy needs, including where these literacy needs arise due to language difficulties/EAL needs. Further language support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of  a new school or schools. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, 47 new schools to cater for demographic demand have been announced to be established over the period 2019-2022.  The majority of these schools have been established, with a small number deferred pending progress on planned housing delivery. </p>  <p>  In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, the Department continues to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision across the country, through the review of the County Development Plans, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) is an external independent advisory group which was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  A prospective patron can choose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to the Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (where applicable).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  Following their consideration of the Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on Gov.ie</p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review.  Additionally, the Department will continue to liaise with the Local Authorities in respect of its review of Development Plans with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-10a.411.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022031000057#WRH06200"><p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that the majority of schools have a general purpose room/Physical Education hall and practically all schools have outdoor play areas.  In addition, many schools, use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>  <p>  Investment and expenditure on PE halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the School Building Programme. The provision of PE halls and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts, form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered  for an existing school. </p>  <p>  My Department provides general purpose and PE halls with the construction of all new primary and post primary schools respectively. These facilities may also be provided where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.  My Department provides funding toward the provision of furniture and equipment including PE equipment in both primary and post-primary schools. In relation to post-primary schools, where my Department provides a sports hall as part of a building project, the equipment provided forms part of the overall furniture and equipment grant to that school. This includes funding for appropriate equipment for a fitness suite consisting of exercise bicycles, treadmills, a rowing machine and elliptical trainers, as well as general PE equipment.</p>  <p>  The types of PE equipment provided in primary schools are bar boxes, balancing benches, gymnastic mats, and climbing unit consisting of large trestles, small trestle, horizontal poles and ladders. It is also open to primary schools to purchase PE equipment under their minor works grant allocation.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Design Guidelines for all new schools provides for outdoor multi use games areas (hard play areas) and the level of play space provided varies with the size of school.  For example, a new 24 classroom primary school with Special Education Needs classes is provided with 3 ball courts (1,755m&sup2; in total),  2  junior play areas (600m&sup2; in total), as well as Secure hard and soft play area (300m&sup2;) and a 100m&sup2; Sensory Garden.</p>  <p>  In respect of new post-primary schools, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school will be provided with 6 ball courts (3,060m&sup2; in total) and a 200m&sup2; secure hard and soft special education play area. </p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision.  The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  However, the second half of the National Development Plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered. </p>  <p>  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

It is a gross violation of international law and the UN Charter. The targeting of civilians and of civilian infrastructure; the use of prohibited weapons; and indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks; are unacceptable. Russia has clear obligations to fully comply with international law and in particular international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  At its meeting On Tuesday 7th March, the Government re-iterated its grave concern about Russia&rsquo;s aggression and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine. The continuing Russian military action against Ukraine is illegal and immoral, involving the utterly unacceptable targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the use of prohibited weapons and indiscriminate attacks.  A full and comprehensive cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Russian military from Ukrainian territory is what is required to ensure the safety of civilians there.</p>  <p>  The Government has announced contributions totalling &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance from Irish Aid funding to support key humanitarian partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in responding to the crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government also considered the implications for Ireland and the actions being taken here regarding the humanitarian and economic issues arising, including the preparations to welcome people fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland. Very significant planning and preparatory work is taking place across Government to provide accommodation and other essential supports to those who have arrived here already, as well as the large numbers of further people expected to arrive. </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for administration of the Employment Permits System. Temporary protection has been granted to displaced persons from Ukraine in accordance with Section 60 of the International Protection Act, the Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC) and Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 of 4 March 2022. The operation of this Directive is the responsibility of the Department of Justice. This temporary protection permission will allow individuals covered to reside in Ireland for a period of 1 year, with the possibility of such permission being extended for further periods.  The granting of temporary protection will include a range of entitlements individuals may wish to avail of, including the entitlement to seek employment or self-employment and vocational training education activities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with its enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to assess the direct and indirect impacts on supply chains and distribution and sales channels for client companies that are engaged in trade with the regions subject to sanctions.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has been working closely with our EU partners in adopting sanctions in response to Russia&rsquo;s violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity. My Department is one of three National Competent Authorities for EU Sanctions and has specific responsibility for the implementation trade sanctions. My officials are working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure comprehensive implementation of these measures. My Department is also engaging directly with traders, through online channels, webinars, and bilateral contacts, to raise awareness of the sanctions and to assist them in complying.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department has established a cross-Department Senior Management Team to ensure strong leadership and good coordination for its ongoing response to the situation in Ukraine.</p></reply>

The money raised from the levy is paid, via suppliers, to qualifying generators eligible for support under a number of Government schemes including the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is responsible for the calculation of the PSO levy each year and ensuring that the scheme is administered appropriately and efficiently.</p><p>The CRU is accountable for the performance of its functions to a Committee of the Oireachtas.

They instead introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives.     I am acutely aware of recent increases in energy costs due to increases internationally and, more recently, due to the crisis in Ukraine. The purpose of the new solid fuel regulations is to ensure that better quality, more efficient fuels will be available on the market. Low smoke ovoids are more cost-efficient than peat and wood logs, in terms of heat delivered per cent cost. Wood with a moisture content below 25% is more cost efficient to burn than wet wood. Both wet wood and sod peat produce very poor heat output, so may be cheaper to buy but require larger quantities to provide adequate heat for the householder, while emitting particulate matter more damaging to human health and the environment.   </p>  <p>  These new measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. Each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. I remain committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge and introducing these regulations will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p></reply>

Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway. </p><p>I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs was to be removed from 1 January 2022. Any PHEV which registered for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date would be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI no longer accepts grant applications in respect of PHEVs. </p><p>Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, we extended this drawdown date to 31 March 2022, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle.</p><p>It should be noted that PHEV owners are still able to avail of other incentives currently in place including: </p><p>-  Low rate of annual motor tax; and</p><p>-  Home charger grant of &euro;600 per household.</p><p>In addition, the LEVTI Scheme which offers toll discounts for alternatively fuelled vehicles was introduced in July 2018 and is expected to run until December 31st, 2022 (available only to a maximum of 50,000 LEVs). BEV and PHEVs continue to qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles (greater off-peak rates also apply to the M50 toll).  </p></reply>

Drivers are important members of the Committee, and four positions are reserved to represent driver interests. All four of these positions are filled by licenced SPSV drivers from across the country and I am satisfied that this ensures the Committee&rsquo;s advice is informed by the perspective of drivers. The Committee also features dispatch operators, passenger representatives, members representing the interests of disabled passengers and older passengers, members from the tourist industry, local government and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am of the view that one of the strengths of the Committee is this broad and diverse representation and I regard the perspective of passengers to be of particular importance when considering SPSV policy issues. </p><p>There are currently two vacancies on the Committee.  The NTA, on behalf of the Minister, is seeking applications from suitably qualified candidates to fill both positions.  In this regard, consideration is being given to filling one vacancy with a Dublin-based SPSV driver who could act as an additional SPSV/driver interests representative, and also assist in ensuring geographical balance among the SPSV representatives on the Committee, given the large number of Dublin-based SPSV licensees. A person who could effectively represent limousine operators nationwide is being sought for the second vacancy.  The terms of office of a number of other Committee members are due to expire later this year and the filling of those vacancies is currently being considered.  The table below shows the existing membership of the Committee. <table>    <tr>       <th>Cornelius O&rsquo;Donohoe, Chairperson</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Finn (representing SPSV and driver interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Francis Doheny (representing SPSV and   driver interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>John Murphy (representing SPSV and driver interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shajedul Chowdhury (representing SPSV and   driver interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mary Henchy (representing local authorities)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Superintendent Tom Murphy (representing   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>James Cawley (representing consumers' interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Michelle Reid (representing consumers'   interests)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Joan Carthy (representing the interests of persons with   disabilities)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ann Campbell (representing the interests of business)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Peter Fleming (representing the   interests of older persons)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Al Ryan (representing the interests of tourism)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>James O&rsquo;Brien (special interest or   expertise)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Noel Ebbs (special interest or expertise)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fiona Brady (special interest or expertise)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vacancy</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vacancy </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

At its meetings, the Network receives reports on developments on humanitarian issues and transport-related impacts at the EU/Ukraine borders, including the impacts on supply chains.  The Network seeks to identify potential actions at EU level to ease the issues at the Ukraine borders, including the transport of refugees from Ukraine. </p></reply>

In general, the EU Directive provides that supplies of goods and services are chargeable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland. Under VAT law, traders/businesses are required to register for VAT where their taxable supplies exceed certain thresholds. However, in general, organisations which are not registered and not required to register for VAT, or are not engaged in taxable activities, do not need to charge VAT on their supplies and, therefore, are not entitled to reclaim the VAT they incur on their purchases. </p><p>Financial accounts should be prepared in accordance with the ordinary rules and conventions of commercial accounting. To establish the taxable profits for a period of account, in circumstances where the charitable tax exemption does not apply, it may be necessary to make various &lsquo;add backs&rsquo; and &lsquo;deductions&rsquo; to the pre-tax accounting profits shown by the accounts to comply with rules of computing profits chargeable to income tax. The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 contains a number of rules related to the calculation of the taxable profits of a trade, and where relevant, these rules apply irrespective of the accounting treatment adopted in preparing the accounts. </p><p>All taxpayers, including voluntary organisations must keep full and accurate books records to enable them to complete their tax returns. The specific type of records to be maintained by persons, in order to fulfil their obligations depends on the nature and size of the business. The records must include details of: </p><p>- All sums of money spent and received in the course of  carrying on a trade, profession or other activity, this includes all sales and purchases of goods and services, </p><p>- The assets and liabilities of the trade, profession or other activity, </p><p>- The acquisition and disposal of assets, which would be chargeable assets for capital gains tax purposes.</p><p>Supporting documentation such as invoices, bank and building society statements, cheque stubs, wages sheets, receipts, etc. should also be retained. Generally speaking, the books and records must be retained for a period of 6 years.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-10a.504.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022031000059#WRM02400"><p>The Government's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine is being crafted within the wider European Union response.  The sanctions imposed by the European Union, and by many other jurisdictions, are unprecedented, and the Government's view is that these should be as onerous as possible.</p>  <p>The EU autonomous measures place obligations on all Member States and every natural and legal person therein, to give effect to the sanctions that have been adopted. Arising from that, Member States are obligated to put in place effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties and to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Regulations are enforced. Ireland does this by way of Statutory Instrument and in relation to Ukraine, that function falls to me, as Minister for Finance. The sanctions process cut across many areas of Government and is managed by a Cross Departmental International Sanctions Committee, known as CDISC, which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.    </p>  <p>  On the financial front, these include targeted sanctions &ndash; including freezing of assets - imposed on many Russian politicians and named individuals.  A ban on financial transactions with the Russian Central Bank has also been imposed, while the EU has also agreed a package that has excluded seven Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system. Other measures include a ban on selling, supplying, transferring or exporting euro banknotes to Russia or to any natural or legal person or entity in Russia. Officials from my Department continue to engage with other public sector members and with the private sector to emphasise the need for due diligence in relation to complying with the restrictive measures that have been put in place.</p>  <p>  Apart from sanctions, Government has been forceful in providing financial assistance to the people of Ukraine.  In my role as Minister for Finance, I am Ireland&rsquo;s Governor to a number of global and European International Financial Institutions including the World Bank, the IMF, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as a number of other regional multilateral development banks. I want to assure the Deputy that Ireland has also been supportive of these Institutions&rsquo; evolving response to the situation and of their initiatives to provide support and financial assistance to the government and people of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I attended a Special Informal ECOFIN Meeting, by videoconference on 2 March last, to discuss the economic and financial situation in Ukraine, as well as the consequences of sanctions on European economies.  At the meeting, we confirmed the increased financial support to Ukraine under the Macro-financial Assistance Package and agreed to take measures to avoid any circumvention of sanctions.  We also noted that the activation of the General Escape Clause - that relates to the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact - continues to apply in 2022, which will allow for fiscal policy to adjust to the evolving situation. There was unanimous support at the Council for this approach. Ministers will continue to coordinate fully to protect our economies.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, the Financial Stability Group, which comprises senior management from the Department of Finance, NTMA and the Central Bank, discussed the Ukrainian crisis at its meeting on 2 March.  Arising from that discussion, the Financial Stability Group has established a Working Group made up of officials from the three FSG organisations. This Group will focus on enhanced monitoring of the situation and provide regular updates to FSG members.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that IBRC (in Special Liquidation) has assets in both Russia and Ukraine. My officials are in regular contact with the Special Liquidators concerning these assets and are monitoring developments closely. Stock market volatility has impacted the value of our shareholding in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ptsb. My officials are monitoring the situation in conjunction with our financial advisers and how it may impact the 2 trading plans currently underway and our future realisation strategies.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would also point out that Government has taken several measures to limit the fallout from the geopolitical situation on households and firms.  Measures include an electricity rebate and a cut in excise duties to mitigate the increase in global energy prices.</p>  <p>  In summary, the situation is evolving rapidly and both I and my Department continue to respond accordingly.</p></reply>

However, he sadly passed away prior to reaching preserved pension age, when this pension would have become payable.</p>  <p>  While the civil service pension scheme of which he was a member provides for pension upon death for a legal spouse and eligible children, these benefits are limited to those beneficiaries. As a result, no pension benefits will be payable in this case based on the application of scheme rules. </p>  <p>  I understand that the OPW issued correspondence advising the individual's family of the above on 23 February 2022 in order to fully inform them of the position.</p></reply>

A team has been established within my Department to coordinate this input to Government planning and Ireland&rsquo;s overall response. The Secretary General will participate in the weekly meetings of Secretaries General of Government Departments, which will monitor developments and coordinate necessary actions, and provide weekly reports to Government.</p><p>The effects of the conflict and the sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus are being kept under close review, both in terms of the overall fiscal impacts and for key areas under the remit of my Department.  </p><p>The Office of Government Procurement in my Department is monitoring the implications of war in the region for supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures.  Russia and Ukraine are significant suppliers of natural resources and raw materials, with potential sustained impacts on energy, production and distribution costs, in addition to potential impacts on supply.  </p><p>Further, the Office of the Government Information Officer (OGCIO) has worked very closely with the National Cyber Security Centre to strengthen the public service protection against cyber-attacks.  These activities include: </p><p>- Running a programme of education and issuing regular reminders to staff; </p><p>- Producing and advising on new baseline security standards for public service bodies; </p><p>- Implementing additional protection on Government Networks; </p><p>- Implementing additional protection on our shared infrastructure; </p><p>- Increased blocking of categories of email attachments that are deemed a security risk; </p><p>- Increased blocking of web traffic that are deemed a security risk; </p><p>- Regular meetings with our supply chain and key partners; </p><p>- Reviewing our contingency plans, risk register and our mitigation strategies; </p><p>- Increasing overall monitoring in this area, including broadening this monitoring to include further threat intelligence feeds; and </p><p>- Implementing appropriate updates to controls and measures in an expedited manner. </p><p>My Department has Member State responsibility for a number of European Union funds including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). My officials are currently engaged with the European Commission and relevant officials of other EU Member States to allow more flexible use of existing EU funds so that such funds can be allocated to measures targeted at refugees. Any such flexibilities will require change to European Union regulations and are therefore being advanced and agreed at European level.</p></reply>

This was a unique and poignant piece of temporary public art which attracted significant public and media attention and resonated with a diverse population of visitors.</p>  <p>  St. Stephen's Green Park which dates from 1635 is an important finite cultural amenity in the centre of Dublin, enjoyed by millions of visitors on an annual basis. While the site is home to many fine sculptures and monuments commemorating important periods and figures in Irish History, it is at capacity and no new sculptures or memorials have been permitted in the last 10 years. Temporary exhibitions and installations are however, permitted from time to time in the Green. In caring for St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, the Office of Public Works aims to present this historic, cultural and tourist attraction to the highest international standards while maintaining the balance between cultural features such as memorials and statuary and the designed landscape and horticultural elements.</p>  <p>  I must emphasise that, from the State's perspective, the Irish National War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge are the premier national location of remembrance, dedicated to those who both fought and lost their lives in the Great War. For decades, the State has invested in the conservation and refurbishment of these gardens and continues to invest on an annual basis in staffing and conservation to ensure this memorial site is presented to the highest standards. These internationally significant commemorative gardens serve as a location of contemplation and reflection for families who lost loved ones in World War I but also for those who fought and returned home. </p>  <p>  I must also advise that the OPW has turned down other similar requests from individuals and communities for a variety of memorials or sculptural features in these national historic properties. I suggest that Ms Purcell liaise with Dublin City Council Arts Department to explore other potential locations in Dublin for this proposal.</p>  <p>  I wish Ms Purcell well with this project.</p></reply>

My Department  will continue to participate in and support these efforts as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs has led on Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy response to this flagrant violation of international law and norms, including through multilateral engagement with European Union partners and at the United Nations, the development of sanctions and the provision of consular assistance to Irish citizens affected by the invasion, and the provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland has announced contributions totalling &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance from Irish Aid funding to support key humanitarian partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries in responding to the crisis.</p>  <p>  From a tourism perspective,  the European Travel Commission (ETC), representing national tourism organisations of Europe, of which Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are members, recently issued a statement condemning the military aggression by the Russian Federation and expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The tourism agencies will continue to monitor the evolving tourism related situation. Officials from my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have also engaged with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the issue of accommodation for displaced nationals arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On Monday, I along with all other EU Ministers for Culture and Media, adopted a Declaration expressing our solidarity with Ukraine and our support for Ukrainian artists, journalists, and cultural and media professionals, and our readiness to assist them.  We also committed to exchanging information, combining our  efforts and sharing best practices in order to stand in solidarity with and welcome Ukrainian artists, journalists and cultural and media professionals, and assess further ways forward regarding cultural cooperation.</p>  <p>  On 1st March the Council of the European Union agreed Council Regulation (EU) 2022/350, which prohibits the broadcast of any content by Russia Today, its regional subsidiaries and Sputnik throughout the European Union.

The restrictive measure form part of the fourth package of sanctions against the Russian Federation adopted by the European Union.  The penalties, in Irish law, for contravening this restrictive measure are set out in a statutory instrument made by the Department of Finance &ndash; the European Union (Restrictive Measures concerning Ukraine) (No.5) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No. 94 of 2022). The Department of Foreign Affairs leads an inter-Departmental group on the enforcement of sanctions. and my Department will provide any assistance that is appropriate.</p>  <p>  I have also responded to correspondence received from the Ministers of Culture of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia , indicating that I will support potential future action, if necessary against state-sponsored media outlets like Sputnik and Russia Today which support the aggression against Ukraine and target European Union countries with disinformation and propaganda. </p></reply>

In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.  </p><p>Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it will be then sold to the MTR provider who is interested in the property. This can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  </p><p>To the end of December 2021, 1,682 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR process and 720 cases are being actively progressed. There has been an upward trend in the completion of MTR cases since 2017, with over 20% of all cases being completed in 2020 (363 cases) and 40% completed in 2021 (678 cases). It is envisaged that the Department will meet its target of 1,000 cases in 2022. </p><p>Valuations undertaken for the MTR scheme take into account the condition of the property when they are carried out. MTR providers, both AHB and non-AHB, are obliged to undertake the necessary remedial or refurbishment works to bring the properties that they acquire under the scheme up to statutory private rental standards and the amount of rent paid is based on the market rent of the property. MTR providers are also responsible for maintaining the property on a regular basis. The Department does not have sight of this cost as they are met directly by the MTR provider.</p><p>At the end of 2021, there were 12 AHBs participating in the MTR scheme.</p><p>The MTR scheme is overseen by the Department but the Housing Agency look after the administration of the scheme on behalf of the Department. Within the Department there is a team of four people managed by a Principal Officer, who have responsibility for the MTR scheme along with other duties. </p><p>A MTR scheme was also introduced for local authority borrowers which is called Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) and has been in place nationally since 2014. Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as social housing tenants. Information in relation to the Local Authority MTR scheme from its inception in 2013 to end 2020, broken down by local authority area, is available on my Department's website under the heading Local Authority Mortgage to Rent at the link below. During that period, a total of 532 households had benefited from the scheme. Information relating to 2021 will be made available shortly.  </p><p> &amp;gt; refer to the section &ldquo;Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme&rdquo;.  </p><p>Both MTR schemes are established parts of the overall suite of social housing options and are important parts of the mortgage arrears resolution process. </p><p>It is possible for MTR applicants to buy back their home if they can obtain the finance for the purchase of the property. To date under the MTR scheme, two properties have been bought back - one in 2019 and one in 2021.</p></reply>

The guidelines are generally reviewed annually and the intention is to conduct a further review in Q2 of 2022.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that social housing developments are delayed due to costs being above the Unit Cost Ceilings (UCCs) for social housing construction projects. The range of social housing developments being advanced will always include projects with costs that are, on occasion, below or above the Department&rsquo;s issued UCCs. As UCCs are based on previously tendered social housing construction projects, they act as useful guide costs for local authorities and AHBs to benchmark their projects against.</p>  <p>  However, it is understood by all involved in advancing social housing projects that a range of factors can impact on the costs for individual projects.  Project-specific issues will always arise and will be central to how a project can be advanced and the costs for same. These factors are part of the regular engagement that happens between my Department and local authorities/AHBs which is focussed on facilitating the earliest possible delivery of new social homes that are both high quality and value for money.</p>  <p>To that end, as well as sharing UCCs with local authorities, my Department has previously shared outline specifications for new social housing and has also recently issued a new 'Design Manual' which will guide local authorities, AHBs and their Design Teams/consultants, on the design of social housing site layouts and the internal layouts of individual social homes.  </p></reply>

As part of the objective to increase social housing delivery, the plan recognises the significant role that Approved Housing Bodies (AHB&rsquo;s) have played as partners in social housing delivery and will continue to play over the next five years. </p><p>All applications under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), with a Payment and Availability Agreement (P&amp;amp;A), scheme are compliant with the scheme guidelines, and comply with the underpinning financial assessment model. Currently there are no delays on these proposals.</p><p>The CALF funding model has worked very successfully over the past 10 years, particularly for the larger AHBs that have adapted their delivery plans to utilise P&amp;amp;A-CALF funding. The increase in market rents over the intervening period has extended the geographic range of areas where dwellings can be delivered to the extent that projects have been completed in all local authority areas. </p><p>Under Housing For All, a specific objective, Action 4.10, is to &ldquo; <i>review the structure and operation of CALF to assess whether any refinements to the facility are required to support delivery of social housing by the AHB sector across a wider range of Local Authority areas.&rdquo;</i></p><p>One of the key purposes of this exercise is to review the structure of the P&amp;amp;A-CALF funding model to determine if it should be adjusted to support delivery by the AHB sector across a wider range of areas and what options might be available to enable this. </p><p>Work is underway on this review with the support of the Housing Agency and is on track to be completed by Q4 this year.</p></reply>

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, acquiring and leasing new social housing units.</p><p>The housing and accommodation needs of a range of vulnerable individuals and families, whether permanent housing or temporary/emergency needs, are supported through funding provided under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). This funding supports priority areas such as age-friendly housing, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless, housing for people with a disability and in the last few years CAS funding is also being used to support other important and emerging areas of housing need delivered by AHBs including the development of new refuges for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, housing for care leavers (people exiting State care at the age of 18), de-congregation and returning emigrants. </p><p>The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units. This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements.</p><p>The details of delivery and average costs for CAS and CALF funded schemes in 2021 are available at the following link.</p></reply>

My Department is involved in these meetings.</p>  <p>  In the immediate-term, my Department is working with the Department of Equality, Children, Disability, Integration and Youth (DECDIY) and exploring options to meet the temporary accommodation needs of those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and coming to Ireland. </p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS), based in DECDIY, is currently managing arrangements to receive those fleeing the conflict into IPAS accommodation, either directly from airports to IPAS or to family and from there to IPAS. In terms of offers of assistance for accommodation coming in through local authorities or the public, the Red Cross will be the centre point for these offers and will liaise directly with DECDIY on same. </p>  <p>  There are already provisions in planning legislation to deal with emergency situations of this nature, which have been used in the past, such as in response to the Syrian refugee crisis or during the COVID pandemic. These provisions allow for the development of new facilities and structures, or for the conversion or repurposing of existing buildings in certain circumstances, without planning requirements, and to provide other appropriate solutions that may be useful in dealing with this current crisis for any displaced persons arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with DECDIY on further development of plans to accommodate Ukrainian&rsquo;s fleeing the crisis in the weeks ahead.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, the regulations will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country,  with limited restriction zones around airports. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.  Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  While these regulations are being advanced, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed restriction zones around airports.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. Arising from the Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of FBR staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The application referenced was registered on 25 March 2020, and is being stored in a secure environment.</p>  <p>  The FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt. FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand for passports and FBR in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service, including the FBR Service, in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive over the past several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected for passports and Foreign Birth Registration in the coming months.</p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s unjustified and unprovoked attack is causing immense suffering for the people of Ukraine. Russia&rsquo;s war is illegal and immoral, and Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. Ireland will do all it can to support the humanitarian response both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. My Department will continue to work closely with colleagues across Government to ensure a coordinated national response. </p>  <p>  The EU agreed on the 4 March 2022 to activate the Temporary Protection Directive. This allows a form of temporary protection aimed at offering immediate help by granting large groups of people collective protection status. Such people would have protection status for up to a year (with a possibility of extension of up to three years), without going through individual asylum claims, and allowing access to housing and other benefits (e.g. education, health, social welfare, residency permits). </p>  <p>  My Department has already put together a &euro;20 million Irish Aid humanitarian package enabling humanitarian organisations on the ground, including UN agencies and the Red Cross Movement, to provide life-saving assistance to the people of Ukraine. Urgently needed medical supplies from Irish stocks are being made available through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s response to the invasion has included multilateral engagement with European Union partners and at the United Nations, the development of sanctions against Ukraine, demonstrations across the world of Ireland&rsquo;s solidarity with Ukraine, bilateral contact with the representatives of Ukraine and of the Russian Federation in Ireland and the provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland has committed &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid to help mitigate the impact of the Russian further invasion of Ukraine on the lives of ordinary people.</p>  <p>  In addition, the EU has agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine under the European Peace Facility; &euro;450 million for lethal equipment and &euro;50 million for non-lethal equipment. Ireland constructively abstained on the lethal equipment package. We will pay our full share (approximately &euro;11 million) and our funding will go only to non-lethal elements. </p>  <p>  In response to the assault on Ukraine, the EU has also adopted the most extensive sanctions in its history. The aim of these sanctions is to incentivise President Putin to find a political solution to the conflict that he has created, and to reduce the funding and equipment available to Russia to continue its illegal actions in Ukraine. Sectoral sanctions target the Russian financial, energy, technology and defence, and transport sectors. Sanctions have been introduced to prevent Russian state-owed media from spreading disinformation in the EU. Measures have also been introduced restricting economic relations between the EU and the two breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk. Individual sanctions have been introduced on Russian persons and entities, with 510 people and 5 entities subjected to asset freezes and travel bans (for persons) since 23 February. The EU has imposed trade restrictions on Belarus for its support to Russia, and has sanctioned Belarussian military leaders. I also refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 299 on 3 March, which provides a detailed overview of all of the EU sanctions that have been adopted in response to Russia&rsquo;s aggressive actions since 23 February. Preparatory work continues on additional sanctions. Ireland has made clear that it will support the widest possible sanctions, as a concrete demonstration of our solidarity with Ukraine.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland is at the forefront of efforts across the UN to bring an end to this conflict and to hold Russia accountable. Ireland co-sponsored a strong UN General Assembly resolution denouncing Russia&rsquo;s aggression against a sovereign state, which was adopted with the support of the overwhelming majority (141) of UN Member States. This is a powerful demonstration of the widespread global rejection of Russia&rsquo;s actions.</p>  <p>  The UN Security Council met on Monday 7 March to discuss the worsening humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Ireland demanded that Russia upholds its obligations under international humanitarian law, and called for an immediate end to hostilities and safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those who need it, where they need it.</p>  <p>  Ireland has joined with 38 other International Criminal Court States Parties in referring the situation in Ukraine to the ICC to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>  <p>  The UN Human Rights Council will also establish a Commission of Inquiry in relation to violations of human rights in Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with European Union, United Nations and other partners to provide assistance to Ukraine.</p></reply>

The initial &euro;10 million funding announced by An Taoiseach two weeks ago will be allocated to support key humanitarian organisations on the ground, namely UN OCHA, UNHCR, ICRC and IFRC, as they provide life-saving assistance to the people of Ukraine. A further &euro;10 million was announced by An Taoiseach on Monday 7 March. Ireland is also sending urgent medical supplies, including protective suits, blood bags, masks and disinfectants, in response to a request from Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).</p>  <p>  In addition, on 27 February the EU agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine under the European Peace Facility (EPF). Some &euro;450 million of this support will be allocated for lethal equipment, with &euro;50 million for non-lethal equipment. In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, Ireland will not be contributing to the funding of lethal equipment. We will pay our full share (approximately &euro;11 million) and our funding will go only to non-lethal elements. </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, Ireland will continue to engage with European Union, United Nations and other partners to provide assistance to Ukraine.</p></reply>

Ireland has taken a forward stance on the European response, contributing to an ambitious sanctions package, the provision of aid and assistance to Ukraine, and the reevaluation of how the European Union engages with Russia.</p>  <p>  At the United Nations, Ireland has been at the forefront of efforts to hold Russia internationally accountable for its actions. We have actively supported Security Council and General Assembly meetings on Ukraine, and have urged others to join us in condemning Russia&rsquo;s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Ireland co-sponsored a strong UN General Assembly resolution, condemning Russia&rsquo;s aggression and calling for their immediate withdrawal, which was adopted with the support of the overwhelming majority of UN Member States. Ireland has called for the safe passage and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, including medical and food supplies, to those in need and has stressed the importance of safeguarding women and children during conflict. We have called on Russia to uphold its obligations under international law and to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland has supported motions and resolutions to suspend Russia&rsquo;s participation in various international bodies, including the Council of Europe.</p>  <p>  My Department has also provided all possible consular assistance to Irish citizens affected by recent events. My officials remain in ongoing contact with registered Irish citizens in Ukraine, currently totalling around 55 people, and are in direct contact to provide assistance and support to families with surrogacy arrangements.</p>  <p>  This is also a regional crisis and Ireland's Embassies in all of the affected countries continue to provide support and services at a time of heightened demand as well as engaging with their host governments in support and solidarity</p>  <p>  We have thus far committed &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid from the development assistance programme managed by my Department (Irish Aid) to help mitigate the impact of the appalling violence inflicted on ordinary people in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage across Government in support of the wider national response by Ireland to this multi-dimensional crisis which is on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War.</p></reply>

EU Foreign Ministers were joined by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, among others. </p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s application for EU membership was not the primary focus of discussion at the 4 March meeting of FAC. However, on 7 March, EU Ambassadors meeting in Brussels formally approved the text of three letters addressed from the Council to the European Commission, seeking the Commission&rsquo;s opinion on the applications for EU membership received from Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia in recent days. EU leaders meeting informally in Versailles on 10-11 March are also scheduled to endorse the decision to refer the three applications to the Commission for its opinion.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of EU enlargement, and of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective. Ukraine has made strong progress in aligning with EU standards and has shown extraordinary determination to uphold the values of the EU, and we are supportive of their accession. We must give hope to the people of Ukraine. They are demonstrating their strong support for the core EU values of democracy, human rights, a free media and economic and social progress.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the time it takes for a country to progress from initial interest in joining the EU, to becoming a fully-fledged candidate country, to actually joining the Union, is significant, as are the formal requirements for qualifying for membership. I also recognise that there are other candidate and potential candidate countries and that the commitments which have been made to them regarding the Enlargement process must be fulfilled.</p></reply>

This launch was followed, in 2015, by an Action Plan to implement the EUMSS, and a revised Action Plan in 2018. </p>  <p>  Ireland contributed to the revision process of the EUMSS Action Plan in 2018 through the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Council conclusions of June 2021 sought to engage with member states to see if the EUMSS and its Action Plan should be updated.  Member States agreed that updates could be provided due to factors that have emerged owing t the passage of time since publivation in 2014. Ireland contributed to this consultation. While it was decided to begin this work in December 2021, meaningful progress will not be made until the work on the Strategic Compass is concluded.  The recent Report of the Commission on Defence Forces recommends that Ireland should deepen its engagement with the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Maritime Security Strategy and consideration given to development of  a whole-of-government National Maritime Security Strategy and a National Aviation Security Strategy.</p>  <p>  While defence remains a national competence, Ireland sees the value in Member States&rsquo; national maritime activities voluntarily feeding into greater EU cooperation and adding value where possible. Ireland is a member of the existing European naval maritime surveillance information-sharing network EDA MARSUR Project and is a participant on the Greek led PESCO project &ldquo;Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance&rsquo; which aims to enhance maritime situational awareness Ireland is also observing on the PESCO project Maritime (Semi) Autonomous Systems for Mine Counter-Measures (MAS-MCM) which aims to deliver a  high level collaboration and delivery of semi-autonomous underwater, surface  and aerial technologies which can be used in a Mine Counter-Measures role.  </p>  <p>  At European Council meetings, the topic of maritime security is frequently discussed, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Defence Format in November 2021, which I attended. That discussion focused on the EU Coordinated Maritime Presences (CMP) concept following the establishment of the Gulf of Guinea as a Maritime Area of Interest (MAI) by the Council on 25 January 2021. </p>  <p>  The EU Coordinated Maritime Presence Concept aims to enhance the EU&rsquo;s visibility through a coordination of the presence of EU Member State assets in areas of concern where there are ongoing activities which could constitute a threat to international peace and security.  The purpose of such a continuous presence is to support information gathering and analysis so as to develop greater situational awareness of key areas of maritime security interest, to support the security of States in the area of interest and to be able to counter illicit activities. The Maritime Coordinated Mechanism is distinct from CSDP missions and operations.</p>  <p>  On 21st February 2022, the Council approved two sets of conclusions on the Coordinated Maritime Presences (CMP) concept, the first extending the implementation in the Gulf of Guinea for two years and the second establishing a new Maritime Area of Interest in the North-Western Indian Ocean. The Strategic Compass also contains a reference to the expansion of the Coordinated Maritime Presences Concept.</p>  <p>  Given my regular engagement in EU discussions on the matter of Maritime Security, I do not see a need to request European Union assistance towards Ireland&rsquo;s coastal security.</p></reply>

We stand ready to assist in any way possible, including in the provision of logistical support by the Defence Forces to other Departments and/or State agencies.</p>  <p>  While my Department has significant land holdings throughout the country, current levels of occupancy of Defence properties is generally well utilised.  That being said, I am sure that there is no reason why some of our land bank could not be used, for example for the provision of modular buildings. My Department is currently exploring the capacity available within the land portfolio and will engage with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in relation to this matter. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is contributing to the European Peace Facility Assistance Measures  which were agreed recently. Ireland's contribution of approximately &euro;10 million,  which will be provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs, will go exclusively towards the provision of non-lethal equipment.  The provision of this funding will allow the EU to quickly respond to the Ukrainian request and responds to a specific ask from the Ukrainian authorities.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to provide strong political and practical support for Ukraine and my officials in both the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs continue to engage in all discussions on the matter as required.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-10a.667.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022031000065#WRS01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247, 248 and 249 together.</p><p>All members of the Defence Forces, have the right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying. Where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations are initiated by the appropriate authorities.</p><p>The Defence Forces policies and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships and unacceptable behaviour are outlined in Defence Forces Administrative Instruction A7. Complaints of unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour are dealt with by the military chain of command either through the legal/disciplinary process or by administrative action.</p><p>Administrative instruction A7, Chapter 1, 'Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces&quot; is the Defence Forces' policy document which deals with sexual harassment, harassment and bullying. I am advised by the military authorities that these complaints are dealt with at different levels, either by way of an informal approach or formal process. Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are available to assist complainants. The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing.</p><p>Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for individuals, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint. Complaints may be submitted orally or in writing to the complainants Commanding Officer, or in the case where they feel themselves wronged by their Commanding Officer, may complain to the Chief of Staff. Notifications are sent to my office and the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces formally when any Chapter 2 complaint is submitted and of its subsequent outcome.</p><p>Under this mechanism there exists further recourse for the complaint to be referred to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for review and recommendation if appropriate. As the Deputy will be aware, the Ombudsman is entirely independent in carrying out his functions in line with the provisions of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces Act, 2004, and his final report, which may include a recommendation on each complaint, is submitted to me for determination.</p><p>I am further advised that in the event that a complaint of a criminal nature is reported, the standard procedure is that the matter is investigated immediately by the Military Police. Where allegations of serious criminal incidents among serving members are brought to the attention of the Military Police, they are traditionally passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their consideration and investigation who have the lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Chief of Staff, is tasked with the maintenance of good order and discipline within the Defence Forces and he provides me with a report on the number of complaints of inappropriate behaviour made under Defence Forces Administrative Instruction A7 Chapter 1 on a quarterly basis. The table below details the number of reported cases of alleged inappropriate behaviour in the Defence Forces in the past six years.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">DFR A7 Chapter 1</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>08 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>07 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>09 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>08 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>05</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>50</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As prescribed in Defence Forces Administrative Instruction A7 Chapter 2, the Defence Forces are required to notify both myself and the Ombudsman of any complaint made under Chapter 2 of this Instruction. The table below is a breakdown of the number of Notification of Complaints under Chapter 2, concerning unacceptable behaviour only, submitted from 2016 to 2021. It is important to note each notification of complaint may contain a number of separate complaints. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">DFR A7 Chapter 2</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>52 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is important to note that no direct correlation can be made between the Chapter 1 figures and the Chapter 2 figures as these are separate processes and can relate to different types of unacceptable behaviour, not all of which relate to sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination. Similarly, the matters complained of under a Chapter 1 complaint may also give rise to a Chapter 2 complaint and, therefore, there may be duplication across some of the cases in both given figures.</p><p>On foot of engagements both I and my officials have had in recent months, with a number of stakeholders, including both serving and former members, I have publicly acknowledged that the systems, policies and pervading culture in the Defence Forces, have not, and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the recently established Independent Review Group, under the Chair of retired High Court Judge, Bronagh O&rsquo;Hanlon, is examining issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces as well as the workplace culture. </p><p>The Independent Review Group will, in particular:</p><p>- Advise on whether the current legislative frameworks, policies, procedures and practices for addressing incidents of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace are effective. </p><p>- Independently assess whether the pervading culture in the workplace is fully aligned with the principles of dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>- Provide recommendations and guidance on measures and strategies required to underpin a workplace based on dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>This Independent Review is seen as a critical and vital next step to ensure that serving members of the Defence Forces are able undertake their duties in a work place that is safe, and underpinned by core principles of dignity and equality and where there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour. I have received an initial report from the Chair of the Review Group confirming that work within the agreed Terms of Reference is underway. As the Deputy will be aware, I have set an ambitious timetable for the Group and I have requested an interim report within 6 months with a final report within 12 months, which I intend to bring to Government.</p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. Further additions to the Equipment Development Plan are currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. Over recent years the capital budget has also been augmented through the reallocation of pay savings.</p>  <p>  There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects for which there will be capital expenditure in the coming years. These include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles which is well underway as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles. The Army's softskin fleet continues to be updated also with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.</p>  <p>   In relation to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Naval Service, the programme of works for the midlife reft and upgrade of the L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works have commenced on L&Eacute; Niamh. The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is an important element of the EDP. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV. The replacement of other vessels is also under consideration.</p>  <p>  An independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompassed the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report is currently being considered.</p></reply>

In conjunction with this, the Naval Service has nine ships. Two ships, L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Eithne, are currently in operational reserve but can be called upon for surge operations in times of national emergency, as was the case when L&Eacute; Eithne was deployed to Cork City in 2020 in support of Operation Fortitude and the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition one ship is in the process of a mid-life re-fit which is expected to last a total of 18 - 24 months.</p>  <p>  At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies. While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance, and as such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multi-faceted activity. Naval Operations Command operate a rotating patrol schedule to maintain a constant presence in the Irish EEZ. This is supported by the Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron which carries out aerial surveillance of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the two CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish EEZ.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps and Naval Service provide assistance and support to maritime search and rescue missions on an as available basis, however, the lead agency for search and rescue (SAR) in Ireland's maritime SAR domain is the Irish Coast Guard.</p>  <p>  Priorities for the Defence Forces are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development, infrastructure and equipment planning processes and are also now being considered in the context of the recently published Commission on the Defence Forces report.</p>  <p>  The White Paper sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Air Corps and Naval Service, which includes the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel (MRV), along with the purchase of PC-12 aircraft and supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces recently published their report on the 9th February 2022. The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference. The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations. The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this process will take at least four to five months in order to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the Commission have set out.</p></reply>

The current shortfall is especially marked in specialist areas, where small numbers are more vulnerable to gaps. Without giving rise to any compromise on safety, the impact of these shortfalls has resulted in greater pressure on individual members and units. There has also been an impact on the operational availability of the Naval Service, and an impact on the overall number of operational ships, which is a situation that has to be managed carefully.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service has nine ships. Two ships, L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Eithne, are currently in operational reserve but can be called upon for surge operations in times of national emergency, as was the case when L&Eacute; Eithne was deployed to Cork City in 2020 in support of Operation Fortitude and the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. L&Eacute; Eithne acted as a forward logistics base and training platform in support of the HSE. Of the remaining seven ships, one is in the process of a mid-life re-fit which is expected to last 18 - 24 months. There are six ships currently available for operations at present.</p>  <p>  At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements. Therefore, notwithstanding some mechanical and staffing issues being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces which was launched on the 9th February 2022. The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference. The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations. There are a number of recommendations included in the report which provide for the upgrade of the Naval Service fleet and an increase in staffing levels within the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion and agreement. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. It is anticipated that this process will take at least four to five months in order to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the Commission have set out.</p></reply>

This launch was followed, in 2015, by an Action Plan to implement the EUMSS, and a revised Action Plan in 2018. Ireland contributed to the revision process of the EUMSS Action Plan in 2018 and input was provided by the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Council conclusions of June 2021 sought to engage with member states to see if the EUMSS and its Action Plan should be updated.  In December 2021 it was decided to begin this work and it is expected to advance further following completion of the work on the EU's Strategic Compass.  </p>  <p>  My Department has applied for EU funding in support of the Defence Forces via the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme (2014-2020). Approval in principle has been received for a number of relevant projects. These projects include funding to support the upgrade of the Air Corps Maritime Patrol Aircraft as well as the upgrade of Fishery Monitoring Centre IT system.</p>  <p>  My Department has also begun discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to investigate the possibility of securing additional future funding to support Naval Service and Air Corps operations under the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) 2021 &ndash; 2027.</p>  <p>  Ireland also participates in Maritime Surveillance projects at EU level both through the European Defence Agency and through PESCO. These projects assist in increasing Ireland's maritime surveillance capability.</p>  <p>  As a committed EU Member State, Ireland supports fully the efforts of EU Member States to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the prevailing challenging security environment, including in the areas of defence and maritime surveillance.</p></reply>

The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps, Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force.</p>  <p>  The Commission was established by Government decision in December 2020 which also agreed its terms of reference and membership.

Current events are highlighting the importance of such a debate.</p>  <p>  The intent is that following relevant consultation, and before the summer recess, I will to revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan. This high level plan will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion regarding the outcome of an ongoing deliberative process, prior to completion of that process and Government approval of any proposed plan of action.</p></reply>

A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and were awarded a certificate from UCD at a ceremony on the 25 February 2022. A new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme September last.   </p>  <p>  This programme allowed SNAs the opportunity to refresh and update their knowledge and skills and provide an opportunity to interact with educators and colleagues in a learning and supported professional environment. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation.</p><p>There are currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. </p><p>The PDST and its Webwise team have developed dedicated resources for teachers, parents, children and young people which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. The Webwise resources are available at <i>www.webwise.ie</i>.</p><p>The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 has promoted the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. A new digital strategy is under development with planned publication later this year. Online safety will be an important feature of the new strategy. </p><p>In 2021, on Safer Internet Day, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 (Coco&rsquo;s Law) was enacted. On that day, the Minister for Justice  announced that an agreement had been reached between her  Department, the National anti-bullying centre at DCU and my Department, to establish a &lsquo;Research Observatory on Cyberbullying&rsquo; focused on providing up-to-date research, advice and resources related to cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment, and the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s Law.  </p><p>The Observatory team has put together an online research repository of resources on cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment which are available on their website for researchers and the general public. The Observatory has hosted online webinars, one of which focused on cyberbullying and which involved national and International experts sharing their knowledge on cyberbullying and online abuse with researchers and with the broader general public, including teachers, parents, and young people.  </p><p>My Department also provides direct funding to external organisations to raise awareness of safer internet use and for the delivery of support and information through various anti-bullying initiatives. This includes the provision of an annual grant to the National Parents Council (Primary) for anti-bullying training and information for parents.My Department also provides funding for Stand Up! Awareness Week , an anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLonGTo, the National Youth Service for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender young people in Ireland. </p><p>An annual grant is also provided by my Department to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre in DCU towards funding its research and training programmes and to meet the running and development costs of the national anti-bullying website, <i>www.tacklebullying.ie</i>. This website provides a single point of information on the types of bullying as well as supports and information on how to deal with bullying for young people, parents and teachers.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying. </p><p>This review will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. </p><p>The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It will specifically consider cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. </p><p>The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. </p></reply>

The strategy has resulted in reforms in initial teacher education, dedicated support for professional learning and curriculum reform. The interim review identified areas for particular focus for the remainder of the strategy to include a set of discrete targets for DEIS schools focussed on reducing the literacy and numeracy achievement gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  To fulfil the programme for Government&rsquo;s determination that all young people will leave school with the literacy and numeracy required for everyday life and further studies a successor Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy for all learners is being developed.

Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p>  <p>  The post-primary school planning area for Greystones is served by 3 post-primary schools including a new regional solution for the Kilcoole and Greystones area which opened in Greystones for the 2020/2021 school year.</p>  <p>  The following post-primary schools currently serve the Greystones School Planning Area:</p>  <p>  - TempleCarrig Secondary School  &ndash; this is a co-educational school with capacity for 750 pupils and was established in 2014.  The Department has recently approved an extension to this school to expand the capacity of the school to 1,000 pupils plus 3 special education needs bases. The school enrolled additional first year pupils in September 2021 on this basis. My Department has approved additional accommodation to the school for special educational needs purposes. </p>  <p>  - Greystones Community College &ndash; this new co-educational school was established in 2020 as a regional solution for the Kilcoole/Greystones area and is currently located in interim accommodaton pending the construction of a permanent school building that will cater for 1,000 pupils. The school already has additional interim temporary accommodation available for 2022 and further accommodation is currently being planned for.  </p>  <p>  - St. David&rsquo;s Secondary School, Greystones is a co-educational school and a major building project to expand the school to cater for 750 pupils commenced on site in October 2020. This project is expected to be completed by November 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is the existing school in the adjacent Kilcoole School Planning Area, Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann, which currently has accommodation for 750 pupils and for which there is a major project approved to expand the school to 1,000 pupils. This project is at stage 2a of the architectural planning process.  Additional temporary accommodation was approved for the school to cater for expanding enrolments pending completion of this extension.    </p>  <p>  In relation to places for 2022 at 1st year level - the annual admissions notice for each of the schools in the school planning area is available on the individual school website. My Department understands that there are currently places available for 1st year applicants in the Greystones School Planning Area for 2022. </p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that with the establishment of Greystones Community College as a new regional school for the Greystones/Kilcoole area and with the completion of the building projects at St. David&rsquo;s Secondary School, Greystones, Templecarraig Secondary School and Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann, Kilcoole, that the resulting additional permanent accommodation will meet the future accommodation needs at post primary level in the area.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. </p><p>My Departments Capital planning and budgeting is undertaken on a multi-annual basis and provides an inclusive allocation to all school projects on the School Building Programme. The capital allocation for my Department in 2022 is &euro;792.4m of which &euro;695m has been assigned to the School Building Programme (A.15 subhead)</p><p>The 2021 capital allocation under the School Building Programme subhead was &euro;665.5m.  A further  &euro;156m was sanctioned for the School Building Programme through the Supplementary Estimate process and from savings in other subheads due to the strong spend and delivery on this programme.  This funding also facilitated the provision of a &euro;62 million  enhanced Minor Works Grants to Primary and Post Primary schools to assist schools with the continued operation of schools in the Covid environment.</p><p>During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  539  of these projects delivered were Primary projects and 152Post Primary. These projects delivered in excess of 64000 school places.</p><p>Currently there are approximately 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025.

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>When a school has been allocated an SNA, the Board of Management, as the employer, is responsible for filling the vacancy and the decision on whether to employ a full time SNA to fill a full time post or to employ an equivalent number of part time SNAs rests with the employer.</p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>ncse.ie/for-schools  </i></p><p>The Special Education Teaching (SET) allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools based on a diagnosis of disability.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>The allocation gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it. </p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  Detailed information on the NCSE review process is published on the NCSE website <i>ncse.ie/for-schools  </i></p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>As this question relates to the allocation of support by the NCSE, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. </p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. </p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.</p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.  </p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems.Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p><p>The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability. <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p><p>Furthermore my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme. The main grant is the capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating costs.</p><p>My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, <i>www.spu.ie</i>.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.  </p><p>The total budget for the Pathfinder programme of works from 2017 - 2022 is &euro;78m.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also add a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend additional resources to those schools most in need.</p><p>This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Using this approach we can be confident that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p><p>This announcement achieves the Programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest numbers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.<b></b></p><p><b></b></p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.  </p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with additional needs nationwide. </p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year </p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of Counties Westmeath and Longford, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools.  Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.</p><p>At primary level, there is currently a network of 25 special classes, including 6 Early Intervention classes, providing specialist placements for students with autism in County Westmeath.  3 of these classes were newly established for the current school year. There are also 14 special classes at post-primary level in County Westmeath, 4 of which opened in the current school-year.</p><p>At primary level in County Longford, there is currently a network of 17 special classes, including 2 Early Intervention classes, providing specialist placements for students with autism.  Again, 3 of these classes were newly established for the current school year. There are also 9 special classes at post-primary level in County Longford.</p><p>The NCSE is continuing to engage with primary and post-primary schools throughout Counties Westmeath and Longford regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next. </p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class. </p><p>I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>Parents seeking special class or special school placements for their children are advised to contact NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes. The local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/regional-servic. </p><p>Information on the list of special schools and schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at </p></reply>

The Special Education Allocation model  was introduced to ensure SET supports are allocated on the basis of the profiled educational needs of schools and SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. Further informationin relation to these allocations is outlined below.</p><p><b>Special Education Teachers</b></p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, due to the Covid pandemic and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated. </p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p><p>Working is ongoing on the re-profiling for 2022/2023 school year and this will be concluded shortly.</p><p><b>Special Needs Assistants</b></p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:</p> <blockquote> 	  	- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.    </blockquote>  <p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>The arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes for the 2022/23 school year are currently under review. An announcement on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In order to promote the education of primary pupils through the medium of Irish, Gaelscoileanna located outside of Gaeltacht areas receive an additional &euro;23.00 per pupil over and above the standard rate of capitation grant, which is &euro;183 per pupil paid to all primary schools. </p><p>An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp;amp; Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) was established to plan and coordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to teaching and learning through Irish.  COGG&rsquo;s functions, as set out in section 31 of the Education Act 1998, allow COGG to provide Irish-medium schools with a broad range of supports including the provision of teaching resources and text books, the provision of support services for teachers and schools and the funding of research all of which are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of teaching of Irish.  COGG also provides CPD for teachers in Irish-Medium schools to improve and develop their own Irish language skills and has recently developed An Tairseach, a portal dedicated to providing access to resources that support teaching and learning in the Irish medium sector <i>www.cogg.ie/tairseach/</i>.  </p><p>In addition to supports provided by COGG, my Department provides funding to support a number of Irish language programmes including the Gaelbhratach programme and the digitisation of S&eacute;ide&aacute;n S&iacute; text books.  My Department will also be providing funding to Foras na Gaeilge for the production of an Irish-Irish dictionary which will directly benefit students in Irish-medium schools by assisting with learning through the medium of Irish without the need to reference English words.  </p><p>In relation to Initial Teacher Education, my Department awarded contracts for two new Irish-medium teacher education programmes in 2018 to increase the supply of teachers with the competence to deliver high quality Irish-medium education in schools.  Work is currently underway to develop a new Irish-medium blended-learning post-graduate programme for post-primary teachers.  This course is expected to become available from September 2023.  In addition, curricular reform has seen a new integrated Irish/English Primary Language Curriculum introduced in 2019 which supports all learners and separate curricula for Irish Medium (&ldquo;Language 1 Irish&rdquo;/L1) and English-medium (L2) are in place at junior cycle level.  Work is underway to reform the curriculum specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish . </p><p>In relation to supports which were cut as a result of the austerity measures in the past decade, my Department implemented the outcome of the review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (September 2012) of allowances and premium payments, under which  some allowances were no longer payable to new public service entrants including &ldquo;new entrant&rdquo; teachers. Circular 8 of 2013 outlines the effect of this review on teachers. In common with a number of job-role based allowances, sanction for payment to new beneficiaries of the &ldquo;Teaching though Irish&rdquo; allowance was withdrawn from 1st February 2012 under the terms of the Circular. Furthermore, if a teacher was eligible for receipt of the allowance prior to 1st February 2012 and subsequently left that job role on a voluntary basis, their entitlement to the allowance ceased from the date of the move and they cannot re-gain entitlement.  Amendments to teacher terms and conditions, including pay and allowances, may be achieved through engagement and collective bargaining agreements between the Government and the public service unions.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p><p>While over 90% of services are contracted locally, Bus &Eacute;ireann apply stringent assessments of each individual driver on 7,000 school routes.  This includes vetting and background checks.</p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has reviewed the matter referred to by the Deputy and has advised  that from the age of 70, all drivers even of private cars must complete a medical report form signed by a registered medical practitioner. This is a Road Safety Authority requirement for any licence category applied for at age 70.  It exists because of the known effects of aging on eyesight, on cognitive and physical performance, the increased risk of co-morbidities and the increased likelihood of drivers taking a number of medications.  For public transport, and especially large capacity public transport carrying children, these risks are increased as the potential harm that could result is that much greater. </p><p>The age limit on school bus drivers was increased to 70 years a number of years ago.

Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p><p>Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p><p>The Castlebar school planning area is served by 3 post primary schools and the following building projects have been completed or are in train to provide further capacity for these schools:</p><p>- St. Gerard's College  - an Additional School Accommodation project to provide 4 general classrooms, Construction room and Home-Economics room has been approved. This project is currently at stage 2a of the architectural planning process.</p><p>- St Joseph's Secondary School  - a building project has recently been completed to provide a total of 7 general classrooms. It is intended that 4 of these new classrooms will meet demographic growth requirements and 3 will replace  existing temporary classrooms.</p><p>- Davitt College. It is intended that this school will expand to provide capacity for 1,000 pupils. The project brief is currently being prepared for this project. The school has been approved substantial additional modular accommodation for the 2022/23 school year to cater for immediate needs including SEN facilities pending provision of the permanent extension. The school currently has an enrolment of 772 pupils.</p><p>It is expected that the building projects completed and to be undertaken at these schools will cater for the future needs of the Castlebar school planning area without the need for an additional new school entity.</p></reply>

For this reason and in recognition of the unique challenges faced by island schools my Department has provided additional supports to such schools.</p><p>As provided for in Circular 0012/2021 each of the 5 island post-primary schools are participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme and are in receipt of 7 additional teaching hours per week, in line with school enrolment, for additional Irish-language support.  From 2018 onwards, a grant of &euro;1200 has been paid to each post-primary Gaeltacht school to purchase Irish-language teaching resources.</p><p>From 2019 onwards, the 5 island post-primary Gaeltacht schools have been given an opportunity to participate in the e-hub pilot project that utilises an online blended-learning provision to provide access to students to Leaving Certificate Physics.</p><p>Three island post-primary schools opted to participate in the e-Hub project schools and these schools have been provided with additional resources including once-off funding (&euro;5,000) for each school to purchase technology equipment. An additional allocation of 4 teaching hours per week has been provided for each of the three participating post-primary schools where an e-mentor is required to support students.</p><p>The Digital Strategy for schools 2015-2020 sets out the Department&rsquo;s current policy on the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment across the school sector. The implementation of the strategy in schools is supported by a Digital Learning Framework (DLF) and comprehensive digital learning planning guidelines, extensive CPD, resources and supports for teachers and school leaders. These supports are available to all schools.In 2020, &euro;100m in grant funding issued to schools for ICT Infrastructure including some &euro;70,000 that issued to the Island schools. All schools have broadband connectivity funded directly by the Department through its Schools Broadband Access Programme.  The development of a new digital strategy is underway.</p><p>Following the submission of correspondence to the Department, including the Oireachtas report identifying the unique challenges facing island schools,<b></b>an intradepartmental<b></b>working group was established in the Department of Education to explore the options for addressing these challenges and to set out recommendations to support post-primary schools located on islands in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>A package of additional supports was provided for each of the five island post-primary schools from September 2018 onwards.  These supports are available in addition to the supports schools receive as part of the Gaeltacht Schools Recognition Scheme. The package of supports comprises:</p><p>-an additional teacher allocation for each of the island post-primary schools from an allocation of 1  full-time equivalent post to 1.5 full-time equivalent posts</p><p>-an additional ring-fenced budget of &euro;15,000 per annum for each school</p><p>-the establishment of Col&aacute;iste Naomh Eoin, that previously had the status of an Aonad Teanga, as an independent stand-alone post-primary school on Inis Me&aacute;in, County Galway.</p><p>My Department provides each Educational Training Board (ETB) with pay and non-pay budgets to support its individual ETB schools, colleges, head office and other centres of education, which would include the 5 Post-Primary island schools. It is a matter for each ETB how best to utilise such resources across the schools in their region. In the 2021/2022 school year, Galway Roscommon ETB was allocated 15 teaching posts and Donegal ETB was allocated 9 teaching posts in respect of island schools, small schools, Gaeltacht schools and co-ed schools in single catchment areas. The distribution of this staffing allocation including Small School posts is a matter for the Chief Executive of each ETB scheme.</p><p>The Department of Education will continue to be represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee for the Development of the Islands, which was established by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2019.</p></reply>

I know that bullying experienced by even one child or young person is one too many and I commit to doing all that I can to prevent its occurrence. Coming from the school sector, I know how seriously this issue is treated by schools, but I also know we must do all that we can to support schools in addressing it.</p><p>Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all schools are required to have in place a code of behaviour that accords with Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools as published by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), now referred to as the Educational Welfare Service (EWS). Each school is required to have an anti-bullying policy within its overall code of behaviour.  The anti-bullying procedures are underpinned by this legal framework and all schools are required to comply with them.</p><p>Under the procedures, all school boards of management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures. In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaints procedures.  Where there is cause for complaint from a parent matters would normally be addressed to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate. If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the school&rsquo;s Board of Management.  </p><p>Anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools are available on the gov.ie website: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/cb6966-anti-bullying-procedures-for-primary-and-post-primary-schools/ </i>.</p><p>In addition the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a psychological service to schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the well-being, inclusion and participation of all children and young people in the school setting. </p><p>Parents who are concerned about their child should make contact with the school principal to discuss the situation. The school principal can request a consultation with the psychologist assigned to the school, if deemed appropriate. </p><p>There are also a variety of services available to young children to provide support and advice on their well-being and mental health.  I have included contact details for a number of these below that may be of assistance.</p><p>- National Parents Council:</p><p>- The National Parents Council Information/Helpline is a confidential service for parents.  The Information/Helpline officers listen, and give information and support to parents to help them make the best possible decisions for and with their children: Information/Helpline: Tel: 01 887 4477 (Monday - Tuesday 10am - 4pm; Wednesday - Friday 10am - 5pm) Email : <i>helpline@npc.ie</i></p><p>- Childline.ie:</p><p>- Their contact number is Freephone 1800 66 66 66 or Free Text: 50101. They will be able to talk to you regarding your current situation and can help you.  If you do not have access to a phone you can carry out a live message chat online with them.</p><p>- Tackle Bullying:</p><p>- Tackle Bullying is a national website to counter bullying and cyberbullying for young people, parents and teachers. They are funded by the Department of Education under the 2013 Action Plan in Bullying (2013) and our site provides a single point of contact for those who are affected or concerned about Bullying and Cyberbullying-related incidents.

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes. </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>It is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area.</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area.</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are  not available to all pupils.</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.</p><p>The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues across a number of school planning areas through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities/patrons.  The Department has been working closely with representatives of schools in Co Kildare to deliver appropriate solutions to provide any required school places, including the provision of necessary accommodation.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>Approximately 1,200 school building projects under the Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction &ndash; most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 including in county Kildare, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>School place needs across all school planning areas will continue to be kept under review, using refreshed Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and other updated information as they become available. </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. </p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025.</p><p>During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 64000 school places. 19 of these projects delivered were in County Kildare; 16 of those were primary schools including one special school and 3were post-primary school building projects. This strong delivery has been facilitated by the continued operation of the school building projects during the COVID period.</p><p>It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the length of time a project takes to deliver depends on a number of factors, including scale and complexity, and is subject to the time it takes to progress through the statutory approval process. There is also always a risk of unforeseen issues giving rise to slippage in the progress of a project through the design, statutory approvals or tendering process. Furthermore, Additional Accommodation projects may differ in the way they progress through the architectural planning process depending on their scope. </p><p>Large Scale &amp;amp; Additional Scheme Accommodation (ASA) Projects in north County Kildare: <table>    <tr>       <th>Roll_Number</th>       <th>School_Planning_Area</th>       <th>School_Name</th>       <th>TYPE</th>       <th>Project_Type</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18644U</td>       <td>Celbridge</td>       <td>STRAFFAN N S</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18988G</td>       <td>Celbridge</td>       <td>ST RAPHAELS SPECIAL SCH</td>       <td>Special Education</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20257C</td>       <td>Celbridge</td>       <td>Scoil Naomh Padraig</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>61661P</td>       <td>Celbridge</td>       <td>Salesian College</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>91614B</td>       <td>Celbridge</td>       <td>Celbridge Community School</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20526D</td>       <td>Leixlip</td>       <td>Leixlip Primary School</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>70691C</td>       <td>Leixlip</td>       <td>Confey Community College</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>00779U</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>PRESENTATION GIRLS PRIMARY   SCHOOL</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17341U</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>MAYNOOTH B N S</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20292E</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>Maynooth Educate Together   National School</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20527F</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>Gaelscoil Ruair&iacute;</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>76554W</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>Gael Col&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>15040T</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>MERCY CONVENT PRIMARY SCHOOL</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17254C</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>SCOIL CHORBAIN</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19597T</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>AN LINBH IOSA</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>61730I</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>Col&aacute;iste Naomh Mhuire</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>Extension &amp;amp; Refurbishment</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>76194S</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>Naas Community College</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20542B</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>Naas Primary School</td>       <td>Planned Primary</td>       <td>New School Building </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12998C</td>       <td>Prosperous_Clane</td>       <td>S N CIANOG NAOFA</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13902O</td>       <td>Prosperous_Clane</td>       <td>HEWETSONS N S</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>Extension &amp;amp; Refurbishment</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19796C</td>       <td>Prosperous_Clane</td>       <td>ST PATRICKS BNS</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>70720G</td>       <td>Prosperous_Clane</td>       <td>St Farnan's Post Primary   School</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>91372D</td>       <td>Prosperous_Clane</td>       <td>Scoil Mhuire Community School</td>       <td>Post Primary</td>       <td>Extension</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>There are no delays save for: </p><p>Hewetsons NS: Prolonged period of time to appoint a design team.

These adjustments will mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, English - Higher Level Paper 1 and Paper 2. In English Paper 1, candidates will have to answer only half of the usual number of questions in Section 1, Comprehending. In English Paper 2 they will only have to answer on any two instead of on all three sections &ndash; a reduction of one third.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been moved out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities they have regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  I also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.</p>  <p>  In addition, there will be a second sitting of the Leaving Certificate examinations, shortly following the first sitting, for those unable to sit those examinations for serious medical reasons, close family bereavement, or due to Covid-19, based on the public health rules that will apply in society in June.</p>  <p>I also confirmed the waiving of the fees for the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. Students will not have to pay the fees which would usually be &euro;116 and &euro;109 for the Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations respectively.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.</p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>The arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes for the 2022/23 school year are currently under review. An announcement on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Approximately 1,200 school building projects under the Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction &ndash; most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 including north county Kildare, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  In terms of staffing, my Department allocates teachers to all schools annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. </p>  <p>  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources at primary and post primary level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The primary staffing schedule has been consistently improved in recent years to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher. Furthermore, primary schools that project an increase in enrolment may apply for an additional teacher allocation and provisional approval is sanctioned in May pending official confirmation of enrolments in September.  </p>  <p>  School place needs across all school planning areas will continue to be kept under review, using refreshed Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and other updated information as they become available. </p></reply>

This however did not change the rate of payment. </p>  <p>  Their entitlement using the Total Contributions Approach was also assessed.

It is estimated that up to 400,000 households will benefit from the Fuel allowance in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million. The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including being in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance guidelines which are available on the Government website at gov.ie/en/publication/e7fcaa-operational-guidelines-fuel-allowance-scheme/ set out in detail the qualifying and disregarded payment schemes for fuel allowance purposes. All other payments are non-qualifying payments and will prevent a household from receiving fuel allowance, irrespective of means.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will allow Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing Ukraine to avail of supports throughout the EU.  I wish to emphasise that people arriving from Ukraine have been granted the status to avail of income supports from my Department under the EU Temporary Protection Directive. </p>  <p>  My Department has an excellent record in reacting quickly and appropriately to emergency situations, as was clear from the way it put in place pandemic income supports in response to the COVID 19 crisis. </p>  <p>  My Department's immediate priorities will be the allocation of PPSNs and the provision of immediate financial supports.  A fast-track procedure for these services has been put in place.  </p>  <p>  People will be eligible for financial support initially under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing the war will satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition and the relevant means test.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s aim will be to ensure that the customer&rsquo;s application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is processed quickly and efficiently to provide immediate financial assistance to these people.  We have  also arranged for payments such as child benefit to be made within a very short period.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice are now in Dublin Airport to meet with people arriving from Ukraine and they will ensure that PPSNs are allocated and temporary residence certificates and the appropriate financial supports are provided. </p>  <p>  As not all people will come through Dublin Airport, my Department's network of Intreo offices around the country will also  allocate  PPSNs and  provide immediate financial supports  to people from Ukraine who arrive in the country. </p>  <p>  The provision of PPSNs to people from Ukraine ensures that all Ukrainians that arrive here have access to other public services and receive the appropriate financial supports.</p></reply>

Ireland and the European Union have the responsibility to do all we can to help Ukraine and its people, and this Government will not be found wanting in offering them the humanitarian support they will need.</p>  <p>  The European Union has put in place a temporary protection Directive to allow Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing Ukraine to move through the EU akin to EU citizens.  This Department will provide support and services to assist people covered by this Directive who are fleeing Ukraine and who arrive in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In relation to Fuel Allowance specifically, which is a Household based payment and subject to household composition rules, it is expected that in the majority of cases people fleeing Ukraine who arrive in Ireland will qualify initially for assistance type income supports such as Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  Such qualification would not affect an already qualified household's entitlement to fuel allowance and so people, as described by the Deputy, can be assured that their situation in respect of fuel allowance would not change in these circumstances. </p>  <p>  Obviously, further subsequent changes in the household composition or the position of such refugees in relation to employment and/or receipt of other social protection supports may affect entitlement and would need to be kept under review on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  While the fuel allowance scheme is non-statutory scheme and not governed by legislation, in most cases, the qualifying conditions for Departmental schemes are outlined in legislation and decisions on these schemes must be guided by the relevant legislation.  Any decision to amend the qualifying conditions will have to be supported by changes to the relevant legislation.</p>  <p>  The situation with regards to people fleeing Ukraine and arriving in Ireland is  evolving and the Government will, of course, keep all aspects of the Department's various schemes under review to ensure that this cohort of people receive the supports and services they require.</p>  <p>  Matters in relation to the Medical Card are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Access to antenatal care is provided on a par with expectant mothers who live in the community. </p><p>Due to the specific needs of a number of the women who are pregnant, specialist HSE services have a very close and responsive working relationship with both prison management and the prison healthcare team.  Most women receive all their antenatal care external to the prison in routine antenatal clinics in the local maternity hospital. When needed and in cases of emergency, specialist midwives will attend the prison; however, this is not normally required.</p><p>Expectant mothers are always facilitated to have their children born in hospital. The Prison Service has a mother and baby unit in the Dochas Centre. Expectant mothers are transferred from Limerick Prison to the Dochas Centre during their last trimester and remain there as long as their baby remains with them. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the construction of a new prison facility to provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners in Limerick Prison is advanced and is scheduled to become operational in the third quarter of 2022.  This development will enhance the facilities within the Limerick Female Unit to care for pregnant prisoners and provide a number of areas where the care of mothers and babies can be facilitated in a safe manner. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note, the number of babies born to women while in prison, when compared to the number who have been in prison while pregnant, is very low.  </p><p>There are currently no babies residing in the Dochas Centre. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the tables below.</p><p><b>The number of pregnant women who have been cared for in Prison in the years 2019 &ndash; 2021 and to date in 2022.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Dochas Centre</th>       <th>Limerick</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 (as of 7.03.22)</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*The Deputy may wish to note that the above counts are not of unique individual prisoners. In addition, there may be overlaps in particular between the figures for D&oacute;chas and Limerick. </p><p><b>The number of babies born to pregnant women in Prison in the years 2019 to 2021 and to date in 2022.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of babies </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 (as of 07.03.22)</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It is a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting: fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Data Protection Commission have carried out an in-depth, independent review of community CCTV schemes. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on a new Bill relating to Garda powers to use modern digital technology including body worn cameras, ANPR and CCTV.  As part of that Bill, it is intended to repeal Section 38 mentioned above and to replace it with new CCTV provisions that will address the Data Protection Commission&rsquo;s concerns and ensure that CCTV legislation is fully GDPR compliant going forward. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of this Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill was approved by the Government and published on the 29th April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of April 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year. </p></reply>

My Department has now put a system in place to issue them for people arriving into Dublin Airport, and arrangements will be put in place as soon as possible to provide letters to those who arrived in recent days. </p>  <p>  Arrangements for the registration of the permission will be put in place in due course.   All necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the process is as simple and stress-free as possible. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Government colleagues and I will continue to work with our EU counterparts on any further EU-wide measures that might be needed to assist those fleeing Ukraine. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the NTPF have informed my Department that for the time period requested there were no patients waiting from an outpatient respiratory appointment at Naas General Hospital. The NTPF also undertook to determine the number of patients awaiting an inpatient/day case procedure for respiratory assessment, and also found there to be no patients waiting for the time period in question.</p></reply>

Reimbursement for medicines under the community drugs schemes is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p>  <p>  The Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP) is a 5-year pilot programme that allows medical consultants to prescribe specified cannabis-based products for patients with certain medical conditions who have exhausted all other available medical treatment options. Those conditions are: </p>  <p>  - Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis </p>  <p>  - Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy </p>  <p>  - Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy</p>  <p>  The MCAP is now open for medical consultants to make an application for themselves and their patients to be registered on the Cannabis for Medical Use Register, operated by the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Prospective suppliers of products to the MCAP can apply to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), acting on behalf of the Minister for Health, to have a cannabis product considered for inclusion in the schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. The onus is on prospective suppliers to submit applications to the HPRA.</p>  <p>  For medical indications not included in the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p>  <p>  From 1st December 2021, the HSE approved reimbursement of Cannabidiol (Epidyolex&reg;)100 mg/ml oral solution via the High Tech Drug Arrangements for the following indications: </p>  <p>  - use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in conjunction with Clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older, </p>  <p>  - use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Dravet Syndrome (DS) in conjunction with Clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older, and </p>  <p>  - use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for patients 2 years of age and older.</p>  <p>  Approved prescribers will be required to provide confirmation that Cannabidiol (Epidyolex&reg;) 100 mg/ml oral solution is being prescribed in accordance with the licensed indications and in line with the terms of reimbursement approval given by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes. Neither Ministers nor the Department have a role in individual price negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing. </p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

There is a strong willingness to assist throughout the system and a desire to support and express solidarity with the people of Ukraine.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are continuing to work with colleagues across Government, across the EU and with the Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland to ensure every health support we can provide is made available. The HSE is currently considering what further offers of medicines and medical assistance can be provided.</p><p>We are engaged with the EU humanitarian response including through:</p><p>-  the direct contribution of funding including for medical supplies</p><p>-  direct response with a number of donations made through the EU Civil Protection Mechanisms.</p><p>A HSE Coordination group led by Global Health and Procurement has been established to coordinate efforts in relation to HSE donations.</p><p>Refugees from the Ukraine will be granted temporary protection status. Under this measure, refugees will be considered ordinarily resident in Ireland for a limited time period and therefore will be entitled to access health care services, in line with other refugee groups and Irish citizens.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are working together to plan and coordinate the response to the health and social care needs of Ukrainian refugees granted temporary protection status. We are also liaising with other Government departments and agencies supporting the arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland.</p><p>The HSE is translating its guide to health care services for refugees and migrants in Ukrainian and Russian languages. Multilingual resources on specific health needs will also be provided, including Covid-19. These resources will be available on the dedicated HSE webpage multilingual resources and translated material.</p><p>The HSE is finalising a plan. This will include health needs assessment (aligned with WHO, ECDC early reports and Ukraine government reports) of the health needs of new arrivals, including public health measures arising from Covid-19.</p><p>This assessment has the following components: <ol type="1"><li>Rapid access to basic priority GP / primary care of Ukrainian refugees in hotels/ communities. The aim of the GP Primary care service is to be available for acute illnesses, provide ongoing clinical care of priority medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic illness plus acute care / triage of illnesses.</li><li>To ensure similar access to GP / Primary care in the community</li><li>Looking at wider health needs over short medium and longer term</li></ol>The rapid health needs assessment will look at the determinants of health, demography: age (child health), gender, vulnerable groups, education, condition before left Ukraine (BBV, major health conditions), during their flight and current conditions (potentially no access to healthcare during transition period to Ireland).</p><p>The provision of primary health care services will align with the processing and reception facilities put in place for Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland, under the governance of the Dept of Justice and other relevant departments.</p><p>Refugees holding temporary protection status will be entitled to apply for a medical card in order to access primary care services for each adult and child dependents. A process will be implemented to facilitate timely access to a medical card, based on the Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) provided by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Ireland provides universal access to community health care services for children up to 18 years and a medical card is not required for children to access these supports. Furthermore, it is noted that a medical card is not required for the public to access acute hospital services in Ireland.</p><p>Additional health supports will be provided where required, for mental health issues and to support people who have suffered trauma. The specific health needs of vulnerable groups will be addressed (children under 5, over 65/70s, pregnant and breast-feeding women, people with major illnesses, unaccompanied minors).  COVID vaccinations will be provided where this is required.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department provides flexible funding of &euro;25 million a year to the UN World Food Programme, who are currently mobilising their operations in response to the situation in Ukraine.</p><p>As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained, for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.</p><p>I will continue to work with colleagues across Government on inflationary pressures on inputs. At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. </p><p>Considerable volumes of both global feed and fertiliser originate and are traded through Ukraine and Russia.  In addition, the food industry largely relies on natural gas for its energy supply, so costs will escalate and increases in consumer prices are likely.</p><p>At an emergency  Agriculture Council on 2nd March, I joined colleagues from across the EU in highlighting concerns about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, food security across Europe, and the availability and price of animal feed and fertilisers. I welcomed Agriculture Commissioner Wojciechowski&rsquo;s assurance that the European Commission stands ready to make support measures available as required. I look forward to the Commission&rsquo;s detailed proposals in this regard, which are expected shortly.</p><p>I am meeting and engaging with stakeholders across the sector on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains. I met with the main farm organisations this week and outlined the challenge that faces farmers in the short and long-term.  Arising from that meeting, I have tasked Teagasc with heading up a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to explore all options to minimise the impact on farms and plan in the short to medium term. </p><p>We must take proactive steps to limit any potential disruption to our feed and food supply chains. I know farmers will rise to the challenge and meet it head on. By working collectively and collaboratively, we can ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what might come from supply chain disruptions.</p></reply>

Each year approximately 400 agricultural crop varieties of grasses, clovers, cereals, maize, oilseed rape, field beans and potatoes are evaluated in Department field trials. This is an invaluable service in support of the Irish tillage sector.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the various seed certification schemes are operated from the centre at Backweston. These Schemes are part of an EU-wide quality assurance system whereby seed intended for marketing is subject to official control and inspection to ensure minimum standards throughout the EU. Under the scheme, seed is certified to meet minimum purity and quality standards ensuring the supply of high-quality seed to farmers and other growers. </p>  <p>  Seed quality is most important in crop production, as high-quality seed is essential for good crop yields and quality and minimises the likelihood of crop failure. Ireland operates a higher voluntary standard in agreement with the Industry thereby ensuring the highest possible standard for seed certified in this country. This service to tillage farmers provides an important assurance to growers that the seed they sow is of the highest possible standard.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the clear benefits to individuals and families in terms of quality of life indicators, remote working from hubs will also support local economies, reduce carbon emissions and may arrest or reverse the depopulation of certain areas.  </p>  <p>  Last May I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform.  The platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to members of the network. There are currently 216 hubs live on the platform, with this number increasing on an ongoing basis. Twelve of these hubs are located in County Limerick, while a  further 12 hubs throughout County Limerick have been mapped for invitation to join the network.  </p>  <p>  Details for the onboarded hub facilities can be obtained via the Connected hubs platform, www.connectedhubs.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to fund the establishment and development of remote working hubs under a number of funding streams.  The establishment of new hubs is funded under schemes such as the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and LEADER.  Proposals for new hubs are brought forward via bodies such as local authorities and LEADER Local Action Groups for consideration under the schemes funded by my Department.  For example, I recently announced funding of &euro;18.5m under the 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme for a range of projects including a number of remote working hub projects.  It is expected that the 2022 Town and Village Renewal Scheme will be open for applications in the coming weeks.  Similarly there is currently a Category 1 Call open under the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, with a Category 2 Call expected later this year. </p>  <p>  The development of a National Hubs Network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery.</p></reply>

We have already lifted Visa requirements to allow Ukrainian people who want to seek safety here to do so as quickly and easily as possible. The EU has imposed three packages of unprecedented sanctions against Russia; hitting the web of companies, financial institutions, state institutions and agencies, oligarchs, government members and media interests that surround President Putin. </p>  <p>  Given the potential implications for a wide range of Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach has convened interdepartmental meetings to further assess the implications of the activation of a temporary protection measure. The Secretary General of my Department attends these meetings. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to offer support to communities across the country through various programmes, and these will also assist the Ukrainian refugees as they arrive in Ireland to seek sanctuary. Included in the range of supports is SICAP, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme. The current programme began on 1 January 2018 and will run until the end of 2022 with a budget of &euro;190m over the 5 years. SICAP aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality. It does this through Programme Implementers, agencies and companies, who work with the most disadvantaged and the hardest to reach in communities.</p>  <p>  The Scheme to Support National Organisations, SSNO, in the community and voluntary sector is a key element of the Department's support for the role of the sector in contributing to the development of a strong and vibrant civil society and improving outcomes for those most disadvantaged. A large majority of the organisations under SSNO will work in areas of social inclusion.</p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports community based organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model and create employment opportunities for disadvantaged people. It offers financial support to assist with the cost of hiring staff to community companies and co-operatives.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, with support of the House, will continue to work as part of the international community and in particular through the European Union and the United Nations, including as members of the Security Council, to bring maximum pressure to bear on Russia and to support the Ukrainian people.</p></reply>
