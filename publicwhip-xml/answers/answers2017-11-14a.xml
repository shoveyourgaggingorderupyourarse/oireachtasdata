In particular, this Cabinet Committee assists the Government in its ongoing consideration of Brexit issues including input to the negotiation process, both on the issues that are of unique or particular concern to Ireland, and more generally.</p>  <p>  The Division prepares me for engagement on a wide range of EU issues, as well as the debate on the future of Europe, and supports efforts to develop our strategic alliances in a post-Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  The Division also supports me in my International role and in all of my international engagements ensuring that they are strategically aligned with, and effectively advance, the Government's priorities, with a particular focus on driving job creation, sustainable economic development, trade, tourism and investment and on protecting and promoting our strategic interests internationally. </p>  <p>  The Division also provides advice and support to me in relation to Northern Ireland Affairs and British Irish relations, and Brexit issues in that context. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit.  For example the Economic Policy Division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness including possible economic impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  In all of its work across international, EU and British and Northern Ireland issues, my Department works closely with other relevant Departments including, in particular, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which has lead responsibility for most policy matters in these areas, including Brexit.</p></reply>

In Seattle, I spoke at an event attended by approximately 250 people from Seattle&rsquo;s business community, as well as local Irish community representatives. </p>  <p>  Also in Seattle, I met with representatives of both Amazon and Microsoft, who between them employ over 5,000 people in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In Silicon Valley, I visited the headquarters of a number of companies with significant investments and operations in Ireland, including Cisco, Facebook, Google and Apple. </p>  <p>  In San Francisco, I spoke at a reception in City Hall hosted by Mayor Ed Lee, and attended by approximately 300 Irish-American business and community leaders. I spoke about Ireland's economic and social transformation, Ireland-US relations, and the strong and vibrant Irish Community in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I also had the opportunity to meet with the family of Ashley Donoghue, one of the victims of the 2015 Berkeley tragedy.</p>  <p>  Also in San Francisco, I spoke at an Enterprise Ireland business networking event attended by 250 people where I used the opportunity to promote the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s innovation ecosystem and highlight the depth of our highly skilled workforce. I also met with representatives of a number of Enterprise Ireland clients exhibiting at the event. </p>  <p>  I officially opened the new San Francisco office of Irish company, Linesight, which is projecting job increases of 200 worldwide in 2018, including approximately 90 jobs in Ireland. I also attended the announcement by IDA client company Twilio that it has chosen Dublin as the location for its EMEA headquarters, with the establishment of 100 jobs. </p>  <p>  Also in San Francisco, I attended a Tourism Ireland event with representatives of the travel industry and airlines, where I had the opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s tourism offering. Finally, I visited Lucas Film studio and heard from production executives there about the positive experience of Ireland as a location for the Star Wars series. </p>  <p>  Overall, my visit to the West Coast was very positive, and a great opportunity to further develop the strong links between Ireland and the United States, as well as promote Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit and other global developments.</p></reply>

My Department is also working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days;</p><p>- Highlighting again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations, by immediately writing to them to seek assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation (the Employment Equality Acts, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, and the Employment Equality Act 1998 (Code of Practice) (Harassment) Order 2012); and</p><p>- Accelerating a planned review of compliance by bodies reporting to the Department with the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p><p>I am confident that these support measures will contribute to the further enhancement of existing governance structures in bodies in receipt of state funding.</p></reply>

Nor am I aware that the Arts Council had received any such information.</p>  <p>  The governance of publicly funded theatres, as with all bodies, is a matter for the Board of the theatres themselves.  All boards have a duty to ensure that their bodies comply with statutory requirements and to ensure that their staff can work in a safe and respectful environment. In this case I understand that the theatre in question has now brought in a respected independent expert to carry out a review of the allegations that have been made.</p>  <p>  However, I have invited the group of eight leaders from Irish theatre organisations, who recently co-signed a statement condemning sexual harassment and abuse of power in the theatre in Ireland, to meet with me and the Arts Council this week. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss ways in which the Department and the Arts Council together can support the sector in creating a safe culture and environment for those working in the industry.</p>  <p>  As I have said I believe that working together my Department, the Arts Council and leading members of theatre organisations can encourage a safe and respectful environment free from abuse of power and sexual harassment.</p>  <p>  I have also identified a number of actions that I can take as Minister in relation to the bodies reporting to my Department. The intention is to help boards under the aegis of my Department fulfil their functions more effectively, and to support them in ensuring that policies in relation to equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively in line with best practice. These actions include:</p>  <p>  -  Arranging separate dedicated Governance workshops for board members and senior staff with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace;</p>  <p>  - Working on a collaborative basis with the Arts Council to make similar training available to other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country at a series of regional information days; and</p>  <p>  - Highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations,  by seeking  assurances of their  compliance with obligations under employment legislation. </p></reply>

The inaugural meeting of the National Famine Commemoration Committee was subsequently held in July of that year. Its main tasks were to consider the most appropriate arrangements for future national commemorations of the Great Famine and to organise such commemorations in 2009 and following years.</p>  <p>  The first National Famine Commemoration to integrate both local input and formal State ceremonials was held in Skibbereen in 2009. Since then, the event has been held annually in a similar dual format in Murrisk (2010), Clones (2011), Drogheda (2012), Kilrush (2013), Strokestown (2014), Newry (2015), Glasnevin Cemetery (2016) and this year in Ballingarry, Co. Tipperary. </p>  <p>  As I announced recently, the 2018 National Famine Commemoration will take place next May in University College Cork.  </p>  <p>  The Decision to hold the National Famine Commemoration for 2018 in UCC was taken by the  National  Famine Commemoration Committee earlier this year in recognition of the University's long tradition of research and study of the Famine including the publication of the Atlas of the Great Irish Famine and the development of the Website to be launched next year.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings. These schemes are administered via the local authorities and include the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the Record of Monuments and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department manages an extensive conservation and recreational property portfolio of some 79,000 hectares. Our 6 National Parks account for circa 60,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. </p>  <p>  While the existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, they also play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. To that end, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable tourism potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.  My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic investment partnership earlier this year with the aim of developing tourism projects and improving visitor experience at our National Parks.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

I am certain that we can meet this target by implementing sustainable increases on an incremental basis between now and 2025 &ndash; a process we initiated in Budget 2018, in spite of it being a tight year across the board.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, I announced a funding package of over &euro;300 million in 2018 towards the development of our cultural and creative heritage, an increase in funding to my Department of &euro;13 million, comprising &euro;9 million in current expenditure and &euro;4 million in capital expenditure. This includes an &euro;8.5 million boost in funding for arts and culture. I also secured an additional &euro;90 million in capital funding between 2018 and 2021 for my Department which will accelerate investment across the culture, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors.</p>  <p>  As part of 8.5m in additional funding, the Arts Council will receive an additional &euro;3 million to enhance its support to artists and arts organisations of all sizes throughout the country.  The total Arts Council allocation of &euro;68.2 million in 2018 represents 23% of total allocation to all areas of my Department and is over 49% of all current expenditure by the Culture Division of my Department. I also allocated an additional &euro;1.55m to the Irish Film Board equivalent to a 9.3% increase.</p>  <p>  As the economy continues to improve over the coming years the Government's ambition is to allocate more resources to arts and culture and to continue to build on the foundations that I have put in place in Budget 2018.</p></reply>

The work of the Committee complemented the work of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, which also provided advice and guidance to the Government on its approach based on the authentic history of the period.  </p>  <p>  Between 2018 and 2023, the Government will recall significant historical events that took place between 1918 and 1923 on the road to the foundation of the State, as well as important themes of that period. I am committed to ensuring that the State's approach to remembering this period and all of those who lost their lives during it will be based on the respectful, sensitive, inclusive and authentic approach that has become the hallmark of the Decade of Centenaries commemorative programme.  I believe that the All Party Oireachtas Committee and the Expert Advisory Group have a significant contribution to make in this regard and I am looking forward to continued positive engagement and consultation with both groups over the coming period.</p></reply>

In this regard, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budgets 2017 and 2018.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation over 2017 and 2018 is &euro;8 million and this additional funding will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).</i>Under this strategy the Arts Council has identified five funding categories that will enable it to deliver on its strategic goals. This includes the provision of funding to support local authorities in delivering arts experiences to people across Ireland</p><p>On 8 December 2016, the Creative Ireland Programme was launched as the Government's Legacy Programme from the 2016 Centenary Programme and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025/&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach.  The Creative Ireland Programme is a high level, high ambition, 5-year initiative, from 2017 to 2022 which is the centenary of the foundation of the State.The Programme aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy. It is being led by my Department in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations - including the National Cultural Institutions. </p><p>Pillar 2 of Creative Ireland is focused on local communities and in this context, a Culture Team has been established in each of the 31 local authorities and each local authority has produced a 2017 Creative Ireland Plan and is now in the process of drawing up a more detailed 2018 Creative Plan setting out a five year plan for local creativity. </p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by very significant additional investment directed at the arts and culture sector.  Already in 2017, I announced details of more than &euro;10 million in capital funding to 122 arts organisations around the country under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018.  This is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.</p></reply>

The ESB has advised my Department that, due to concerns over public health and safety and access for emergency services, a number of damaged and fallen trees on a public walkway within the site had to be removed following the severe weather conditions of mid-October last.</p>  <p>  The ESB has also advised that wet ground conditions, at the time that the works were carried out, have resulted in the surface of the walkway requiring reinstatement. I understand that this will be done by the ESB when weather conditions are favourable.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will be meeting with the ESB shortly on this matter and will then decide if any further action by my Department is required.</p>  <p>  Most land in protected sites is in private ownership. It is the policy of my Department, subject to the availability of resources, when it becomes aware of damage to a protected site to investigate the matter, in conjunction with other public authorities, if required.  </p></reply>

This year the allocation is &euro;3.5 million and the scheme is supporting in the region of 500 projects across the country, creating employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund has an allocation of &euro;1.324 million in 2017 and is supporting 67 projects nationally.  It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  </p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes for 2017 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.  </p></reply>

I, also, am of the view that local authorities will have a key role in supporting engagement and facilitation in local communities and in developing suitable commemorative initiatives at county level in line with the principles expressed in the Expert Advisory Group's Second Statement. </p>  <p>  I recently announced a public consultation process to stimulate debate around how the significant historical events and themes from 1918 - 1923 might be appropriately remembered and I would like to encourage the local authorities to participate in this process and submit their views. The issue of funding will be examined in this context.</p></reply>

This is a significant recreational resource and Waterways Ireland has been proactive in the development of Blueways and Greenways as a means to attract new visitors and in response to the growth for recreational activities such as walking, canoeing and cycling.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland, along with partners in Monaghan County Council, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and East Border Region Ltd, is currently in the development phase of constructing a 22km greenway between Smithborough in Co. Monaghan and Middletown in Co. Armagh along the route of the Ulster Canal.  The project is funded by the INTERREG VA programme and will be one of the first cross-border Greenways in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Blueways have been successfully in operation on the Shannon since October 2014 linking Drumshanbo with Carrick-on-Shannon. Waterways Ireland recently opened an iconic Blueways Boardwalk on Acres Lake at Drumshanbo which is already attracting large volumes of users.  The Shannon-Erne Blueway was opened in May 2016 linking Leitrim Village with Belturbet, Co Cavan, providing 70km of paddling journeys, 25km of walking trails and 8 km of cycling. Waterways Ireland, in conjunction with Local Authorities and other partners, are continuing to extend the Blueways offering on the Shannon and Shannon-Erne. </p>  <p>  On the Barrow navigation, Waterways Ireland have submitted planning proposals to upgrade the Barrow towpath.  This will provide a 112km trail from Lowtown in Co. Kildare to St Mullins in Co Carlow.  </p>  <p>  Work on developing the Royal Canal towpath as a walking and cycling destination is expected to be completed by December 2018 when the 145km route can be marketed as one of the largest Greenways/Blueways in Europe. </p>  <p>  On the Grand Canal 21km of towpath has been upgraded with a further 110km yet to be completed.  Waterways Ireland are again working with Local Authorities, Leader Groups, the National Transport Authority and the National Trails Office to ensure planning and funding are progressed to upgrade all of the Grand Canal towpath.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the development of greenways and blueways presents valuable opportunities for rural communities to attract more visitors and enjoy their own local amenities. Their value lies not only in the recreational opportunities that they offer but also in their potential to stimulate local businesses and regenerate local areas. Greenways and blueways  also provide an effective model for partnership between the private, community and voluntary sectors and relevant State bodies.  </p></reply>

The primary focus of the visit was on growing trade, investment and tourism opportunities between Ireland and the US, and on highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and other international developments. In all of my engagements, I emphasised Ireland's unique value proposition and all of the advantages that make us an attractive and stable location for investment including our commitment to the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The programme included a series of meetings with existing and target client companies of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  I visited the Headquarters of a number of companies with significant investments and operations in Ireland, including Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Google and Apple. Between them, these companies employ almost 18,000 people in Ireland.  At each of these meetings, senior executives outlined their very positive experiences in Ireland, including the strong capabilities of their Irish-based workforces, and the positive outlook for their operations here.</p>  <p>  There were a number of significant and positive announcements during the trip in terms of foreign direct investment and jobs for Ireland.  I was particularly pleased that Facebook announced their intention to create hundreds of additional jobs in their Irish operations next year. </p>  <p>  I attended the announcement by IDA client company Twilio that it has chosen Dublin as the location for its EMEA headquarters, with the establishment of 100 jobs.  I also officially opened the new San Francisco office of Irish company, Linesight, which is projecting job increases of 200 worldwide in 2018, including approximately 90 jobs in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I believe that my recent visit to the US West Coast was a valuable opportunity to engage with so many key decision-makers and promote Ireland as a location for investment.</p></reply>

Broadly, the Scheme will be open to businesses of up to 499 employees, which can also demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of  Brexit. They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy. They must also use the loan to meet working capital or cash flow requirements. The scheme will be open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.</p>  <p>  I will be outlining more details on the scheme later this week.  </p></reply>

Storm Ophelia was, of course, an unprecedented weather event in Ireland and while overall the event was well managed there are certainly lessons to be learned.</p>  <p>  The national response to Storm Ophelia was coordinated by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy T.D., and the National Emergency Coordination Committee. I understand that the response to Storm Ophelia is being reviewed and a report will be prepared which will be submitted to the Government Taskforce on Emergency Planning for its attention before being submitted for the approval of Government in January 2018.  A number of issues already identified for consideration as part of the review related primarily to having arrangements in place to the greatest extent possible pre-emergency, so that appropriate processes can be activated without delay, as required.</p>  <p>  In relation to health and safety in the workplace, I would point out that employers have a duty to ensure the safety and health of persons at work and must manage work activities to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety and health of their employees while they are at work. The legal duty of care for employers relates both to the workplace and while persons are travelling for the purposes of work. However, employers do not have a specific legal duty under occupational safety and health legislation in relation to commuting to and from work.  I note, however, that many employers, both private and public sector, closed their places of work of their own volition not because of the risk to employees while at their place of work but because of the significant risks associated with travelling on roads during the storm and in this regard the closure of workplaces most likely contributed to the saving of lives.</p>  <p>  In respect of the staff within my Department, they were advised not to come to work on Monday 16 October. In this regard, upon a red weather warning status being announced for the whole country on Sunday, a decision was taken by the Secretary General to keep our buildings closed on Monday and this was communicated to staff across the Department. Notices were also displayed on buildings to ensure that any staff who turned up on Monday morning also got the message and returned home. </p></reply>

This is in acknowledgment of the increased spend of Irish consumers online, and the need to assist Irish businesses to compete in this space.</p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum, which I chair, was set up by my Department to provide a platform for structured engagement between the retail sector and Government Departments and public sector bodies. A Working Group of the Forum is examining capacity-building in the retail sector through tailored skills initiatives, including digital skills. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Trading Online Voucher Scheme, funded by Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices, was introduced in 2015 to provide training and match funding to microbusinesses to trade online. Over 1700 vouchers were approved in 2015, and 1140 in 2016. 587 vouchers have been approved in the first half of 2017 (to end June). Results from businesses in receipt of the TOV show that sales increased by 20%.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Framework for Town Centre Renewal, developed earlier this year by the Town Centre Renewal Working Group of the Retail Forum, will help address the challenge of town centre renewal, another key concern for the sector. Addressing town centre renewal will be an important factor in sustaining the attractiveness of town centres as places not only to live in but to work in, do business in, invest in and to visit and shop in. The Framework sets out a practical step by step action plan for Stakeholders to work collaboratively to enhance their local town or village, and encourages towns and villages to establish a digital platform in response to the changing retail environment. It is also intended to be a support document for towns and villages applying for funding under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>  <p>  The question of the adjustment of VAT rates is a matter for the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  I am informed that developments are taking place at EU level to neutralise any VAT advantage gained by retailers from within or outside the EU.  On 1 December 2016 the Commission published proposals aimed at modernising VAT on e-commerce.  In the first instance, the proposals extend destination VAT to cross-border business-to-consumer supplies of goods to and supplies of goods from 3rd countries into the EU.  This means that regardless of the location of the supplier, the rate of VAT charged on the supply of a good will be the rate of VAT applying in the Member State of the consumer.  This levels the playing field for retailers so that consumers are not incentivised to purchase goods in Member States who apply lower VAT rates.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, the proposal abolishes the current &euro;22 exemption threshold for low-value goods coming into the EU.  This threshold is a long standing administrative measure to reduce the burden on customs officials, but in the online age has become a key tax discrimination for EU retailers.  The abolition of this threshold will add to the level playing field between EU and non-EU retailers.  </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the charging of VAT on supplies of goods from 3rd countries into the EU, the proposals include a provision to deem marketplaces as liable to pay VAT due by 3rd country suppliers who supply business-to-consumer into the EU through those portals.  This is a significant change that will level the playing field between non-EU online retailers and domestic and EU retailers in a practical manner.  Discussions on these proposals are ongoing at EU level and are due to be implemented by 2021.</p></reply>

Some insurers may offer introductory discounts to named drivers.  However whether a named driver, on a taxi policy or commercial fleet policy, receives an introductory discount depends on the length of their driving record and number of years claims free driving they have.  I understand that this is considered against the backdrop of each individual insurer&rsquo;s overall claims experience.</p><p>I have been advised that a situation where a person is not a named driver on an employer&rsquo;s commercial policy might arise where he or she  is provided with access to a vehicle with the consent of the employer and is covered under an open driving policy.  In such a scenario, Insurance Ireland  confirmed that the same principle of not earning a no claims discounts also applies.

This is an historical derogation known as a super-reduced VAT rate.  Normal reduced VAT rates must be 5% or more.</p>  <p>  As Ireland applied a super-reduced rate to the supply of livestock on 1 January 1991 we are entitled to retain that rate but the VAT Directive does not allow any new items to be applied at the super-reduced rate after that date.</p>  <p>  For VAT purposes, livestock is defined as meaning live cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, and horses normally intended for use in the preparation of foodstuffs or in agricultural production. As alpacas were not included in the definition of livestock on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the 4.8% super-reduced rate to them now. In this regard the rate of VAT on the importation or supply of alpacas is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p></reply>

The final stage in the phased reduction of the credit will complete on 31 December 2017, after which the credit will cease entirely.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that tenants are facing in the current rental market, but it is my view that the re-introduction of a tax credit would not be an appropriate tax measure at this time.  By their nature, tax credits are of benefit only to individuals with sufficient taxable income to fully utilise them.  Furthermore, demand-side supports of this nature can, as identified by the Commission on Taxation, become priced-in to the market, further increasing rental costs.</p>  <p>  Instead, this Government has focussed on changes to the regulatory environment to support tenants.  Many of these measures are outlined in the final report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords, which was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on Budget day.  These include the establishment of the Residential Tenancies Board to regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in order to protect both tenants and landlords; the introduction of improved minimum Buildings Regulations standards for rented accommodation; increased notice periods for both landlords and tenants; and the increase of rent review periods and the introduction of rent increase limits in Rent Pressure Zones. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the &lsquo;Strategy for the Rental Sector&rsquo; which was published by the Department of Housing in December 2016.  My colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, T.D., would be able to provide the Deputy with further information on the measures contained in this report.</p></reply>

VAT on these services is now chargeable where the consumer is located instead of where the supplier is located.  </p><p>As a result of the change, EU and non-EU businesses are required to register and account for VAT in every Member State in which they supply TBE services to consumers or, alternatively, to avail of the optional special scheme known as the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS). MOSS is a simplification scheme that allows a business engaged in TBE supplies to register in a single Member State, to file a single quarterly return and pay its VAT liability for all Member States through a web portal in the Member State of registration. This enables suppliers to avoid having to register and account for VAT in all the Member States to which they make TBE supplies. Transitional rules for the period 2015-2018 provide that the Member State of registration may retain a percentage of the VAT collected for other Member States, with the retention percentage being 30% in 2015 and 2016 and 15% for 2017 and 2018. Therefore the final retention fee payment in respect to VAT retained by Ireland from VAT revenues collected in respect of supplies to other Member States through the MOSS system for 2018 will be received in Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>In relation to Question 47806/17, I am informed by Revenue that the majority of VAT MOSS returns and payments are received on a quarterly basis, in the month following the period where the liability arises. Payments are subsequently submitted to and received from Member States by the 10<sup>th</sup>of the following month. The table below provides an overview of the VAT collected, amount retained and the VAT remitted to each Member State from 1 January 2017 to end September 2017. Small variations may be observed between the actual sums collected, retained and remitted due to rounding. Please note that some of these values are provisional and may be subject to future revision.</p><p>In relation to Question 47807/17, I am informed by Revenue that the gain to the Exchequer in 2018 arising out of the right to retain a proportion of the VAT paid on certain services provided to unregistered customers in other Member States is estimated at &euro;210m.<table><tr><th></th><th colspan="3"><div>Gross VAT Received <br /><br />&euro; million</div></th><th colspan="3"><div>Amount Retained <br /><br />&euro; million</div></th><th colspan="3"><div>VAT remitted <br /><br />&euro; million</div></th></tr><tr><td>EU Member State</td><td>Q 1 2017</td><td>Q 2 2017</td><td>Q 3 2017</td><td>Q 1 2017</td><td>Q 2 2017</td><td>Q 3 2017</td><td>Q 1 2017</td><td>Q 2 2017</td><td>Q 3 2017</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>6.7</td><td>6.7</td><td>6.4</td><td>2.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>4.7</td><td>5.7</td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>8.4</td><td>8.8</td><td>8.6</td><td>2.5</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.3</td><td>5.9</td><td>7.4</td><td>7.3</td></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Croatia</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.9</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>12.3</td><td>13.1</td><td>13.4</td><td>3.7</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>8.6</td><td>11.1</td><td>11.4</td></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.1</td><td>4.0</td><td>1.2</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.6</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>46.4</td><td>50.8</td><td>50.8</td><td>13.9</td><td>7.6</td><td>7.6</td><td>32.5</td><td>43.2</td><td>43.2</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>58.4</td><td>59.1</td><td>56.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>8.9</td><td>8.5</td><td>40.9</td><td>50.2</td><td>48.1</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.5</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>1.6</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.8</td><td>1.9</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.2</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>20.9</td><td>22.7</td><td>22.4</td><td>6.3</td><td>3.4</td><td>3.4</td><td>14.6</td><td>19.3</td><td>19.0</td></tr><tr><td>Latvia</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>14.2</td><td>15.3</td><td>15.1</td><td>4.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>9.9</td><td>13.0</td><td>12.8</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>3.9</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.2</td><td>1.2</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.6</td><td>2.7</td><td>3.4</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>2.2</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.6</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>1.6</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.2</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.9</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Slovakia</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.2</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>14.7</td><td>16.4</td><td>17.0</td><td>4.4</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.5</td><td>10.3</td><td>14.0</td><td>14.4</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>15.9</td><td>16.7</td><td>16.2</td><td>4.8</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.4</td><td>11.2</td><td>14.2</td><td>13.8</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>107.8</td><td>116.2</td><td>110.9</td><td>32.4</td><td>17.5</td><td>16.6</td><td>75.5</td><td>98.7</td><td>94.3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These are the director&rsquo;s fiduciary duties which are owed to the company rather than to the appointing shareholder though under the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) there is a provision allowing a nominee director to have regard for the interests of their appointer. </p><p>Accordingly, State nominated directors to the banks do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.  Over the years there have been contacts between these directors and my Department but I am not aware of any particular approaches in relation to the tracker mortgage issue. </p><p>Going forward the State has negotiated the right to appoint directors to banks in which we have a large shareholding. My officials are working on a new procedure for any future appointments to bank boards, that will address the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to, &ldquo;Cease to appoint new Public Interest Directors to the banks, and reform the procedures for the appointment of bank directors by the State, with a view to increasing transparency in the process&quot;.</p><p>It is important to note that any new appointment procedure for bank directors needs to have due regard to the distinct differences which exist relative to appointments to State boards.  These include the fact that the State is not the only shareholder in these banks, the requirements of the Central Bank/SSM Fitness and Probity Regime and the requirement to have a broad set of expertise relevant to large regulated entities in an ever more complex regulatory environment.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department's website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations. </p>  <p>  32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of the year in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The fourth quarterly update should be published early in the New Year and will focus on the 14 actions which are due for completion in the third quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  I believe that the ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in addition to the implementation of the Working Group's forthcoming report on employer and public liability, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for October) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 15.2% from the peak in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high level of last year.</p></reply>

This compares to annual rent inflation of 6.6 per cent based on Residential Tenancies Board data. </p>  <p>  The fundamental issue with the housing market in Ireland today is lack of supply.  This applies to the rental market specifically and to the residential property market more generally.  To address this, the Government's housing strategy Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness adopts a whole of government response with 84 actionable measures across five key pillars and aims to increase overall housing supply by 25,000 new homes every year by 2020.  The measures set out in the Action Plan aim to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing for both first time buyers and purchasers of family homes.</p>  <p>  More recently, the Government has been engaged in a review of Rebuilding Ireland, in order to assess its impact and to consider additional actions to address issues with supply in the housing market.  Further to this, in Budget 2018 an additional &euro;500 million was allocated to build an additional 3,000 social housing units by 2021.  Furthermore, funding of &euro;750 million from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is being made available to a new vehicle - Home Building Finance Ireland &ndash; to boost the supply of debt funding to residential development.  These measures are intended to increase the supply of both private and social residential properties and thus ease inflationary pressures in the market. </p>  <p>  The Government has also sought to specifically address rent inflation through the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ).  These measures have been introduced to address inflation in rental prices within designated areas.  There are signs that this measure, as well as government initiatives more broadly, are beginning to moderate rental prices.  For example, in Dublin the rate of increase in the second quarter of 2017 (5.8 per cent) is at its lowest since the second quarter of 2013.  The Government will continue to closely monitor developments in rental sector and the housing market more generally.</p></reply>

If income is less than &euro;12,700, the individual must transfer &euro;63,500 of their retirement fund to an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or purchase annuity to bring up their level of income to this amount.  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a capital nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement. </p>  <p>  On foot of changes to the AMRF arrangements which were introduced in Finance Act 2014, with effect from 1 January 2015, AMRF owners can draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the owner's discretion.</p>  <p>  EU Directive 2014/49/EU on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland being unable to repay deposits.  The DGS is administered by the Central Bank of Ireland and is funded by the institutions covered by the scheme.</p>  <p>  The DGS protects:</p>  <p>  - Depositors if a bank, building society and/or credit union authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland is unable to repay deposits;</p>  <p>  - Eligible deposits up to &euro;100,000 per person per institution;</p>  <p>  - Current accounts, deposit accounts, share accounts in banks, building societies and credit unions.</p>  <p>  The Irish DGS protects deposits held at EU branches of authorised Irish institutions.  Deposits held with credit institutions that are authorised in another European Economic Area Member State are covered by that country&rsquo;s deposit guarantee scheme.</p>  <p>  Deposits by pension and retirement funds are excluded from the coverage of the DGS.  By way of derogation from that exclusion Member States were permitted to include certain personal pension schemes.  Following transposition into Irish law, DGS Regulations (S.I. No 516 of 2015 &ndash; Part 4 Regulation 10(1)(k)) state that, other than an exception for Small Self-Administered Pension Schemes, deposits by pension or retirement funds are excluded from any repayments by the DGS.  </p>  <p>  Pending any further changes to the European Directive to include retirement schemes, I have no plans to revise the current implementation of the Directive in Ireland.</p></reply>

The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households.  Consequently, there is no provision under the Student Grant Scheme to provide for any exceptions to those involved in the process of bankruptcy and/or insolvency agreements.</p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.  Information on the fund is available through the Access Office in the third level institution attended.  This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at<i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme.</p>  <p>  Significant improvement has been made in recent years, with the number of primary schools with access to broadband speeds of greater that 30mbs having increased from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 in 2017.  In Dublin, some 70 school in 2012 had access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater, now some 360 schools in Dublin have access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater.</p>  <p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements.  A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  Some 900 of those schools have now been connected with the balance to be in place by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  The policy of this Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  In the case of the school referred to be the Deputy, the Schools Broadband Service Desk and the current Service Provider have reviewed the service provided, and they advise that the school is on the best broadband solution available at present.  The school was upgraded in 2016 to an e-fibre solution and can receive speeds of up to 90mbs.</p></reply>

It is now 31% higher than in 2011. </p><p>At present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans. My Department's Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.  In line with Circular 30/2014, schools are required to put in place Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support. </p><p>Providing power to the National Council for Special Education, as envisaged under Section 10 of the EPSEN Act, to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, is currently being considered in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014. </p><p>This new model for allocating support to pupils with special educational needs has been implemented from September 2017.  Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools which was published on 7th March 2017 sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have also been published;<i>.</i>One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.</p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA), to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p><p>In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs.  This Working Group has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme. </p><p>It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

More favourable treatment on the religion ground shall be taken to be discrimination unless by reason of the nature of the institution&rsquo;s activities or the context in which the activities are being carried out, the religion or belief of the employee or prospective employee constitutes a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement having regard to the institution&rsquo;s ethos, that the action taken against a person must be objectively justified by reference to that institution&rsquo;s aim of protecting its religious ethos and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. </p>  <p>  My Department has received correspondence in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-14a.326.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111400064#WRG01100"><p>Schools are funded by capitation grants and have the flexibility to decide at local school level how such funding is used.  The Department provides several curricular and other supports which include possible horticultural projects, but does not seek to impose particular routes of study on individual schools.  The following is an outline of the ways in which horticulture can form part of a school&rsquo;s educational activities or curriculum.</p><p><b>Primary schools</b></p><p>Primary schools teach the primary school curriculum.  The Primary School Science Curriculum has a Stand &ldquo;Living Things&rdquo; with a strand unit &ldquo;Plant and Animal Life&rdquo; that enables children to become aware of the basic life processes in animals and plants to investigate the factors that affect plant growth and to understand some ways in which plants reproduce. </p><p>While horticulture, as such is not one of the 11 subjects of the Primary School Curriculum (1999), the Geography Curriculum focuses on the interrelationship between the human environment and the natural environment.  In the strand unit, people living and working in the local environment and people living and working in a contrasting environment, pupils from 3<sup>rd</sup>to 6<sup>th</sup>classes are provided with opportunities to explore and investigate aspects of the lives of these communities.  In some instances, pupils can be familiarised with peoples&rsquo; work and how this work (horticulture)can support others locally or further away.  Depending on the area studies, the work and contribution of the horticulturist may be explored and understood.  Visits to garden centres are sometimes arranged so as to get a better understanding of this work.</p><p>As part of the strand &ldquo;Environment awareness and care&rdquo; and in relation to the strand unit, &ldquo;Caring for my locality&rdquo; pupils are enabled to identify and implement strategies to enhance the environment through planting trees, flowers, wild gardens and also to develop a school garden.  Many schools have embraced the concept of school gardens, where space allows, and pupils are enabled to plant vegetables, fruits and  seasonal flowers.  In addition, the pupils are involved and responsible for the garden and its care.  Some schools, through participation in the Green Schools initiative and under the theme &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; create their own compost and this in turn is used in the school garden to support the growing process.  This strand integrates very well with aspects of the Science Curriculum.</p><p><b>Post-primary schools</b></p><p>At post primary it is a matter for schools to decide which subjects they wish to offer, and there is no ringfenced funding for delivery of subjects involving horticulture, as a rule.  One of the Leaving Certificate subject options available is Biology.  Through the study of Biology students explore the diversity of life and the inter-relationships between organisms and their environment.  They become aware of the use of living organisms and their products to enhance human health and the environment.  In the LC Biology syllabus students learn about: nutrition in flowering plants; reproduction of the flowering plant; growth regulators in plants and students conduct an ecological habitat study.  There is no requirement for horticultural facilities in order for a school to provide Biology.</p><p>Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science involves the study of the science and technology underlying the principles and practices of agriculture.  It aims to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes that promote the sustainability of agricultural resources, and places emphasis on the managed use of these resources.  Students can select an aspect(s) of horticulture while studying Agricultural Science as part of their learning experience of the subject.  Plants and animal types associated with agriculture are studied, and investigations are undertaken into such aspects as soil, ecology, plant and animal physiology, farm crops, farming practices, genetics and microbiology.  The Agricultural Science syllabus specifies students should carry out scientific investigations into Plant Physiology to include at least three distinct aspects e.g. plant structure in relation to function, plant-water relationships, plant growth regulators, plant reproduction.  Teachers usually do these experiments in the laboratory using plants in pots.  They could be done in a horticultural polytunnel but it is not necessary.  The Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association (IASTA), is also active in providing CPD for their members.</p><p>There is an optional  vocational specialism Agriculture and Horticulture within the Vocational Education element of the Leaving Certificate Applied.  The course is designed to introduce students to the knowledge and basic skills which apply to the efficient and productive use of natural resources.  It is envisaged that students will select those areas of study which are relevant to their interests, the local economy and the potential employment opportunities therein.  That syllabus specifies that students will:</p><p>- Acquire basics skills associated with agricultural/horticultural processes (aim, page 5, syllabus).</p><p>- Observe and experience actual work practices relating to chosen aspects of the course.</p><p>The Horticulture module of this syllabus is designed to be student-centred and activity-based suggesting that hands-on horticultural practices should be a component.  In this instance, it is likely that a school must have some horticultural facilities on site.</p><p>In the new Junior Cycle Science specification students should be able to:</p><p>-evaluate how humans can successfully conserve ecological biodiversity and contribute to global food production;</p><p>-describe photosynthesis as a biological process;</p><p>-investigate factors that affect photosynthesis;</p><p>-design, plan and conduct investigations</p><p>None of the above, although related to plant growth, implies growing plants so there would be no need for a school to have horticulture facilities to cover the science specification.</p><p>As part of the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015, schools are also allowed to develop their own 100-hour short courses to offer as part of their junior cycle programme.  A template and guidelines have been developed and published by the NCCA to assist schools. </p><p><b>Cross-sectoral support</b></p><p>Both Primary and Post-Primary teachers are supported by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) with teaching resources and Continuing Professional Development.  There is also material available on Scoilnet regarding horticultural projects.  The Green-Schools initiative is a student-led programme with involvement from the wider community.  The programme is operated and co-ordinated by the Environmental Education Unit of An Taisce(FEE member for Ireland).  Green-Schools is operated in partnership with Local Authorities and is supported by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community &amp;amp;amp; Local Government; Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; The Department of Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Irish Aid, National Transport Authority; National Parks and Wildlife Service, Irish Water and the Wrigley Company Limited.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions.

This partnership has meant that DIT provides the academic input, with lectures taking place in Sherkin by video link, while SIDS has provided the administrative assistance and facilities to ensure the smooth running of the programme and support for students on site in Sherkin.  </p>  <p>  I understand that SIDS has informed DIT that the funding it receives from Cork County Council is not guaranteed for this year and therefore it is not possible to commit to continuing this course for new entrants.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 will be recruited in 2017-2018.  That figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017 so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced.  All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete.  We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p><p>Data is entered at school level to the On Line Claims System (OLCS), which records all absences (substitutable and non-substitutable) for all school staff members paid directly on the Department&rsquo;s payroll and through which claims for substitution are made.  The Deputy should note when considering the data that in some cases the rules governing absences and the employment of substitutes provide that the leave absence is not substitutable.  Some examples of cases where a substitute claim is not recorded against a substitutable absence are as follows:</p><p>- Professional Teacher Development- In some cases schools close for the provision of professional development training for the new primary curriculum.  Absences for professional teacher development are normally substitutable but if the school is closed then no substitutes are required.</p><p>- Force Majeure/Illness in Family - The first day of this leave absence is not substitutable.</p><p>- Self-Certified (Uncertified) Sick Leave - This leave is no longer substitutable except in smaller schools for multiple absences on the same day.</p><p>The Deputy should be aware therefore that the data in the table include days for which a substitute is not required or where a substitute is not employed under particular leave arrangements but which nevertheless are recorded on the OLCS as a substitutable absence.</p><p>In the school year 2016/17 there were six hundred and seventy nine retired teachers who returned to teach and they worked approximately nineteen thousand substitute days.  </p><p>Under the terms of Circular 25/2013, it is possible to employ unregistered persons in place of registered teachers in limited circumstances only and for very limited periods.  The maximum number of days that an unregistered person can be employed at any one time is five days.  There are currently three thousand seven hundred primary schools.  Based on information obtained from the Department&rsquo;s database, the managerial authorities of primary schools in the school year 2016/2017 employed three thousand six hundred persons who were not registered with the Teaching Council at the time of employment.  These persons were employed by the managerial authorities for approximately thirty two thousand substitute days.</p><p>I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level.  Due to the additional positions being created in 2016 and 2017, young teachers now have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles.</p><p>I have taken some immediate steps to ease some of these pressures.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council.  My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.  In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo;.  The report focusses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply and my Department is considering how the development of a model can be progressed, from within available resources.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p><p>I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.  In that context my Department intends engaging with the various stakeholders, including school management bodies and the HEA, regarding further actions in this area.</p><p><b>Table: Number of substitutable days and number of substitutable days where no substitute claimed </b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Dates</b></th><th><b>Number of substitutable days</b></th><th><b>Number of substitutable days where no substitute  claimed**</b></th></tr><tr><td>1/9/2015 &ndash; 30/6/2016</td><td>939,840</td><td>65,872</td></tr><tr><td>1/9/2016 &ndash; 22/12/2016*</td><td>353,341</td><td>26,817</td></tr></table></p><p>*Half school year</p><p>** Includes days where no substitute required (e.g. whole school closure for professional development) and days where substitute not due under leave arrangements (e.g. first day of <i>force majeure</i>leave) </p></reply>

This includes teachers recruited to fill the almost 3,000 additional teaching posts put into the system in September 2017 to meet rising demographic needs, provide additional resource teachers, provide enhancements to guidance and school leadership and meet the need for additional posts arising from Junior Cycle professional time.  The figure also includes SNAs recruited to fill the 975 additional SNA posts to be allocated to schools over the period September to December 2017.  In addition, the cost of pay restoration for staff recruited in September 2017 to replace staff who retired in August 2017 at the end of the school-academic year is included.  The cost of pay restoration for these staff was not included in the previous figure of &euro;85 million.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.   The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;33,805 to &euro;61,951 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. </p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  The recently concluded Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on the 12th of October 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The recently published Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 shows further progress in this area.</p>  <p>  The new Public Service Stability Agreement would also bring undoubted benefits to newer teachers.  In January 2018, a newly qualified teacher straight out of college will earn &euro;35,958.  In October 2020, a newly qualified teacher straight out of college will earn &euro;37,692.  This is a very competitive graduate salary.</p></reply>

The proposed legislation will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p>  <p>  The introduction of this proposed legislation will fulfil a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to improve information and complaint procedures for parents and students relating to schools.  The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter.</p>  <p>  The draft Bill went to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Pre-legislative scrutiny began on 7 March with officials, NGOs and certain of the education partners, followed by a session on 21 March with some more of the education partners.  The Committee held a further session with the remaining education partners on 30 May.  The Oireachtas Committee have completed the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  My Department will now commence drafting of the bill, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>All schools have been advised of their allocations for SNA support for the 2017/18 school year.  Details of SNA allocations which have been made to schools have been published by the NCSE on their website at<i>.</i></p><p>Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2017/18, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.</p><p>The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked in the following instances:</p><p>- a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>- a school may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA supports to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the child(ren) concerned.</p><p>The provisions of Section 14 of SNA Circular 0030/2014 require that SNA allocations, which are made from September 2014, will be time bound; linked to the provision of a personal pupil plan; will be made initially for a maximum period of three years; will be subject to annual review, and will be subject to a full reassessment of their care needs at the end of the three year period.</p><p>The NCSE have developed a review process which will give effect to the provisions of the circular and which will review all SNA allocations in accordance with these provisions.  This review process will commence in the coming weeks. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available at <i>.</i></p><p>As the matter raised in this question refers to an individual child, I have arranged for the NCSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where textbook publishers wish to produce books for any particular subject, this is entirely at the discretion of publishers.  Equally, it is at the discretion of teachers and schools should they wish to use textbooks where these are available.  The Department, through both the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), has provided training, guidance and resources for teachers in Politics and Society since Phase One of the subject&rsquo;s introduction began in 2016, and will continue to provide such support, including online support.  Participating teachers have also been supporting each other by pooling and sharing resources, with the encouragement of the PDST.  As this subject is so strongly rooted in current affairs, and is so strongly linked with active, student-centred methodologies, these are other factors which suggest that the absence of textbooks should not be seen as a drawback to delivery of the subject in any way. </p><p>The Department is happy to advise that sample examination papers have now been made available by the State Examinations Commission.  These can be accessed at the links: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>These sample papers, following on from sets of sample questions provided previously to teachers by the NCCA, should help to give a general indication of what the eventual examination papers may look like, but it is important to stress that teaching and learning should always focus on what is required in the subject specification primarily, not in textbooks or examination papers.</p></reply>

The European Commission subsequently published a White Paper on the Future of Europe, and followed up with a series of reflection papers covering a number of key issues including European Defence, EMU and Globalisation.  The main thrust of the White Paper is an attempt to look at some of the options or different paths that the EU could take over the next decade.  The options are by no means exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive. We have welcomed the White Paper and the Reflection Papers as important contributions to the evolving debate on the Future of Europe.  These papers are for the most part cross-cutting in nature and are being examined across a number of Government Departments.  At last month&rsquo;s European Council President Donald Tusk formally launched his Leaders&rsquo; Agenda.  He is proposing an ambitious work programme for the next two years. His intention is to maintain unity among the 27 by facilitating a more dynamic process &ndash; restoring ownership to the European Council and seeking to find pragmatic ways forward. President Tusk&rsquo;s approach should ensure an inclusive way forward, building on the Bratislava Process. We strongly support President Tusk&rsquo;s positive forward-looking agenda, focused on some of the key challenges facing Europe and its citizens.  On Friday, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D., and his counterparts will have a discussion at a summit in Sweden on education and culture as part of the Leaders&rsquo; Agenda.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow the Taoiseach and I, together with the Minister for European Affairs, will formally launch the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe at the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin. This will mark the formal start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe they want to see evolve. Our aim is to raise awareness of the issues involved; to encourage participation in the debate; and to use this engagement process to formulate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider European debate.</p>  <p>  In taking forward this debate, our focus will be on delivering a positive EU agenda with concrete outcomes that directly benefit Irish and EU citizens.</p></reply>

The request was filed with the Court on 4 December 2014.  On the basis of new material uncovered, the Government has contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the victims should be recognised as torture. The Government&rsquo;s request currently remains under consideration by the European Court of Human Rights.  In March 2016, the UK were invited to submit observations on a number of questions posed by the Court (publicly accessible via the website of the European Court of Human Rights).  At the request of the UK, the deadline for submission of their observations was extended by the Court from time to time up to December 2016.  In February 2017, the Government submitted its reply to the UK observations on the application.  The Government is now awaiting notice from the Court as to how it wishes to proceed in considering the case.  The Government&rsquo;s application therefore remains active with the European Court of Human Rights, and given this context, the case is not one that I have discussed directly with my British counterparts.</p>  <p>  In a separate process, the Belfast High Court on 27 October last, further to a judicial review application by some of the victims in the case, quashed a 2014 PSNI decision not to take further steps to investigate the question of identifying and, if appropriate, prosecuting those responsible for criminal acts during the interrogation of the victims.  The Court finding means that the question should be revisited.  My Department is continuing to monitor these developments.</p>  <p>  My Department has also remained in contact with the legal representatives of the survivors and their families in this case since the Government&rsquo;s request to the European Court of Human Rights in December 2014 and has kept them updated on the status of the case.  As the case in Strasbourg progresses, my Department will maintain these contacts so that those directly affected remain informed of progress with the Government&rsquo;s application.</p></reply>

I am aware of credible reports on the terrible conditions faced by many migrants and refugees in Libya, including those set out by the organisation referenced by the Deputy. I strongly condemn all human rights violations and abuses.</p>  <p>  Through the EU, Ireland and other EU governments are working to relieve the suffering of both Libyan citizens and migrants. At the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland expressed deep concern at the conditions in detention centres. Following this, EU Foreign Ministers adopted Council Conclusions in July, which urge the Libyan authorities to improve humanitarian access to and conditions in detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention. At the European Council on 19 October, the Taoiseach highlighted concerns about the conditions experienced by migrants in Libya.</p>  <p>  The security situation in Libya is fragile, which limits the capacity of the international community, including the EU, to ensure accountability in response to reports of abuses. Bringing about a step-change in the situation of migrants in Libya will require restoration of political stability, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country. Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p>  <p>  The EU has a number of initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya. The EU also provides training (including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues) and other support to enhance the border management capacity of the Libyan authorities. In addition, the EU supports the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to ensure that there are adequate reception facilities for migrants. The EU has mobilised &euro;182 million on migration-related projects for Libya, which are being implemented by a number of partners, including international agencies such as the UNHCR and UNICEF.</p>  <p>  The only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to improve conditions in countries of transit and origin. The fight to reduce poverty in countries of origin, which is one of the main drivers of large irregular migratory flows, remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. At the European Council in October, the Taoiseach highlighted the need to address the root causes of migration, and announced that the Government will double Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Trust Fund for Africa to &euro;6 million.</p></reply>

I call on all concerned to work to de-escalate tensions, and to resolve disagreements peacefully. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are significant players in the Middle East region, a region where leadership in promoting peace is very much needed. This is a richly diverse region, where many peoples and religions have long histories, and where communities have shown that peaceful co-existence is possible among peoples who have different religions, languages and cultures. However, after more than six years of war in Syria, over two years of war in Yemen, and the struggle to defeat Da&rsquo;esh in Iraq as well as Syria, the toll of conflict on civilians in this region has been devastating.  The long-running nature of these conflicts show the pitfalls of seeking to resolve differences by military means exclusively. At the Foreign Affairs Council in October 2017, the EU reiterated that it stands ready to actively promote and support initiatives to ensure a more stable, peaceful and secure regional environment. The Iran nuclear deal has shown the way forward, pointing to how patient diplomacy can defuse tensions, and produce win-win solutions.</p>  <p>  It is in the best interests of the people of the region that neighbouring countries find a way to de-escalate tensions, to resolve differences peacefully, and to build positive cooperation. In the most recent meetings between my officials and the Embassies in Ireland of both Iran and Saudi Arabia, Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about regional tensions were raised, and my officials stressed the importance of peaceful resolution of all disputes.</p></reply>

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. It also includes action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.  The initiative led by France, which culminated at the Paris Conference in January this year, and which the Government fully supported, restated international support for the two state solution but was unable to achieve international agreement on how to revive the political process to reach that objective.</p>  <p>  In recent months the new United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. In recent discussions with my EU colleagues, I have urged that the EU must both strongly support the US initiative, but also continue our own work on the ground to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved. I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done.</p></reply>

At its meeting on 20 October, the European Council welcomed the progress made to date but agreed that further work is needed before it can agree that sufficient progress has been made on all three exit issues. In this regard, I note that a further round of negotiations took place on 9-10 November.  The European Council also agreed to begin internal preparations among the EU27 on the EU&rsquo;s priorities for the framework for the EU-UK future relationship and transitional arrangements. The aim of such discussions will be to ensure that the EU is prepared to begin these discussions with the UK as soon as a decision has been made to move into phase 2.</p><p>During these discussions among the EU27, Ireland will continue to advance its long-held position that transitional arrangements will be a vital part of the Brexit process, so as to provide certainty and continuity to citizens and businesses. Our position on this matter and the reasoning behind it was set out clearly in the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive document on <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</i>, which was published on 2 May.</p><p>The possible duration of transitional arrangements is one of the issues for consideration and future negotiation.  There is for now a general view, on both sides, that any transitional arrangement should be time-bound and cannot be open-ended.  At the same time, I believe that the transition should be as long as necessary to ensure a smooth landing into a future relationship agreement. How legally and practically that might be achieved would be for discussion.</p><p>While I believe that both the EU and the UK must be ambitious in seeking to conclude a future relationship agreement as soon as possible after the UK leaves the EU, I have expressed the personal view that, given the complexities involved, including the need for ratification of such an agreement, this could take as long as five years.  I would note that others, such as the former UK Representative to the European Union, Sir Ivan Rogers, have expressed similar opinions. Of course I hope that less time will be needed.</p><p>The most immediate focus remains on achieving sufficient progress on the three exit issues, including on the Irish specific issues. I am hopeful that progress can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that a decision can be taken by the European Council in December that discussions with the UK on future relationship issues, including on transitional arrangements, can begin.</p></reply>

It was clear well in advance that it would not be possible for the EU&rsquo;s Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to recommend that sufficient progress has been made.  I welcome the call by the European Council for work in the negotiations to continue, and its commitment to reassess progress at its next meeting in December. The EU has been clear on what is expected from the UK in phase 1 and now is the time for the UK to make the necessary commitments across all three exit issues.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the European Council also agreed to begin internal preparatory discussions on priorities for the future framework for the EU-UK future relationship, and for transitional arrangements. The aim of such discussions, which began at official level last week, is to ensure that the EU is ready to begin phase 2 negotiations with the UK as soon has sufficient progress has been recorded. This should be seen not just as prudent preparation but as a signal of goodwill.</p>  <p>  There was some progress on citizens&rsquo; rights during the negotiating round of 9/10 November.  More work needs to be done but we note the Task Force&rsquo;s view that the UK has provided useful clarifications that are a good basis for further work. There is however significantly more work to be done on the issue of the financial settlement, where more detail is needed from the UK as to how it will honour its commitments, as promised by the Prime Minister in her Florence speech in September.</p>  <p>  On the Irish specific issues, the support of our EU partners for finding solutions to the unique challenges facing the island of Ireland has been strong and consistent throughout this process.  The basis of the EU&rsquo;s position remains as set out in the European Council Guidelines of 29 April and the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles paper of 7 September. The EU&rsquo;s approach to this week&rsquo;s round of negotiations has not departed from this, but has built upon it.</p>  <p>  Overall, more needs to be done before the December European Council.  We do not underestimate the challenges ahead but the Government remains hopeful that, with hard work and political will, sufficient progress can be made in the intervening period. I believe that this is the shared view of all EU-27 Member States and I also believe, based on my own discussions and on reports from our Missions, that the British Government is increasingly aware of the steps it needs to take.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

Such costs will be apportioned for annual levy purposes as appropriate to each category of legal practitioner concerned.  Under this levy mechanism, when commenced, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will operate on a self-funding basis.</p>  <p>  The raising of the levy under the 2015 Act is also contingent upon the establishment of the Roll of Practising Barristers to be introduced under Part 9 of the 2015 Act and for which section 133 allows a six-month lead-in period. The Roll will comprehend all practising barristers providing legal services whether or not they operate within the Law Library. The Law Society will continue to maintain the Roll of Practising Solicitors.</p>  <p>  These two Parts of the 2015 Bill will be commenced and put into operation once the relevant preparations have been made for the new Roll of Practising Barristers under section 133 and the relevant calculations for the levy can be applied on foot of actual expenditure by the Legal Services Authority under section 95.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;1 million was disbursed under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority with a similar amount expected to be disbursed for 2017.  Any funding advanced under this interim arrangement is being provided on a recoupable basis to support the Authority until its own levy framework comes into operation.</p></reply>

Those resolutions require the Tribunal to report to the clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with its findings and recommendations. Therefore, I do not propose to say or do anything which could be interpreted as impinging on its independence.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Garda Commissioner who has statutory responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. I do not believe that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.  Indeed, I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  The rehiring of persons on a contract basis does not require the approval of either the Policing Authority or the Government.  Neither is there a requirement to tender for the purposes of rehiring retired individuals on a temporary basis.</p>  <p>  On a general note I would reiterate that the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. To that end the Government has been supportive of the former Commissioner, and continues to support the acting Commissioner in ensuring that the required resources are at the disposal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner.  The then Commissioner identified that the requirements of the Tribunal could best be met by the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons and my Department approved this in February 2017, subject to formal sanction, which was conveyed in May 2017.  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian) for up to nine months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal. I am advised that the services of two retired senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (one retired Assistant Commissioner and one retired Chief Superintendent) were engaged initially for a period of six months and then for a further period of three months to 30 November 2017 in accordance with the formal sanction. Their contracts fully comply with pension abatement regulations.</p>  <p>  Funding for the engagement of the persons concerned is met from within the Garda Vote. I am informed that the expenditure incurred to date is &euro;78,840.</p>  <p>  I would reiterate that the provision of these additional resources is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation is able to cooperate with the Tribunal to the fullest extent, without unduly affecting the ability of the organisation to continue to carry out its normal vital work.</p></reply>

It is expected that this position will be filled on a permanent basis following the holding of a competition for Detective Inspectors in the near future.</p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, on 2 November the Government published a report outlining a range of measures to enhance Ireland's corporate, economic and regulatory framework and this includes a reconstitution of the ODCE, which will be led by the T&aacute;naiste in her role as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

These reforms in family law recognise the crucial role of parents and other relatives, including grandparents, in a child's life.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 extensively amended the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in relation to guardianship, custody and access. </p><p>Section 11B of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as amended by section 55 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) allows relatives of a child, such as grandparents, to apply to court to have access to a child on such terms and conditions as the court may order.  The court is required to have regard to all of the circumstances, including in particular: </p><p>(a) the applicant's connection with the child,</p><p>(b) the risks, if any, of the application disrupting the child's life to the extent that the child would be harmed by it,</p><p>(c) the wishes of the child's guardians,</p><p>(d) the views of the child, and</p><p>(e) whether it is necessary to make an order to facilitate the access of the persons to the child. </p><p>Section 11E of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 57 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that a grandparent or other relative may apply to court for custody of a child where he or she is an adult who has undertaken the child&rsquo;s day-to-day care for more than 12 months and the child has no other parent or guardian willing or able to act as guardian. </p><p>Section 3 of the 1964 Act provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. </p><p>I have no role in the making of court orders, as this is a function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p><p>While I have no plans at present for further amendment of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, as well as the relevant application forms, is available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.  </p><p>The fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p><p>There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities or different classes of applicant.  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act are kept under on-going review by my Department; however, there are no plans to amend the fees.</p><p>The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.<b></b></p><p>The situation concerning what EU entitlements may be available to UK citizens following Brexit is a matter for the negotiations currently underway between the EU and the UK.  The outcome of any Brexit negotiations will not affect the citizenship status of persons, including UK citizens, residing in the State.  </p><p>As outlined, the grant of Irish citizenship is a national competency and there are no current plans to amend the legislation.

Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.  </p>  <p>  That said, there are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-11-14a.478.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017111400067#WRK02200"><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.   The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.   </p></reply>

Currently the overwhelming majority of the vetting applications received at the National Vetting Bureau are received via the e-vetting system. </p>  <p>  The National Vetting Bureau has offered the e-vetting system to all registered organisations and remains in a position to bring any organisation currently using paper applications onto the e-vetting system with immediate effect.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the turnaround times for vetting applications submitted by organisations who have not engaged with the e-vetting system and who are still submitting paper applications is 4 weeks for 80% of paper applications received. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations. </p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.   </p></reply>

In approximately 75% of all cases the ward&rsquo;s Committee is a family member or a trusted friend. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that if there is no suitable or willing relative or friend available, or if there is a conflict of interest between the ward and the person who would otherwise have been appointed, or where there is disagreement among a ward's relatives about how his/her affairs should be managed, the President of the High Court can appoint the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to act as the Committee.</p>  <p>  The only person required by law to be formally notified of the petition for wardship is the respondent, that is, the person in relation to whom the wardship application is made.  However, it is the practice of the Wards of Court Office to seek confirmation from the solicitors for the petitioner that the next of kin are aware of the application.  Also the petitioner is asked to propose a Committee for appointment.  The petitioner is usually one of the next of kin.</p>  <p>  If a family member writes to the Wards of Court Office objecting to the application or to the proposed Committee, the Wards of Court Office brings this to the attention of the President of the High Court prior the matter being heard to seek his directions.  The family member is informed of the relevant court date and is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the court on who the Committee should be.</p>  <p>  A Committee may wish to resign from the role or may be replaced as Committee during wardship.  If the Committee is to be replaced by the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court he or she is consulted prior to that decision being made.  The Courts Service has advised that the appointment of a Committee or the removal of a Committee is a decision entirely for the President of the High Court exercising his wardship jurisdiction. </p></reply>

Following the Group's initial meeting, it was decided to close my Department's offices in Killarney on Monday 16 October because of the red weather warning for certain counties including Kerry.  A decision was also taken not to transport prisoners in custody to court in those counties.  Arrangements were also discussed with senior management in both the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board as they also had staff in the affected counties.  Later on Sunday evening, when the red weather warning was extended to cover the entire country, it was decided to close all of my Department&rsquo;s offices on Monday.</p><p>An email was issued to all staff late on Sunday evening advising them of the office closure on Monday.  Many managers with official mobile phones were contacted by text and both managers and staff with mobile email access were asked to contact their colleagues as not all staff have access to emails outside of office hours.  The closure message was also shared via the Department&rsquo;s Website and Twitter account.  Nevertheless, a small number of staff still reported for duty on Monday 16<sup>th</sup>October.

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in 14 provincial court offices.  </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the Probate Office together with the various District Probate Registries issue between 16,000 to 17,000 Grants of Probate per annum.</p><p>The Courts Service has advised me that waiting times in the Probate Office in Dublin for a Grant of Probate are currently 17 weeks for applications made by solicitors on behalf of clients and approximately 11 months for personal applications.  All applications are assessed on the basis of the date on which they are lodged, an approach which provides fairness and equity to all applicants.

In such cases, it is open to applicants to bring the matter to the attention of the Probate Office.  <b></b></p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate all applications for Grants in deceased persons' estates are made on foot of a number of mandatory legal documents which must be furnished by the applicants.  These require detailed checking by the Probate Office to ensure that the estate of the deceased person is administered correctly and in accordance with the law.  Where a person opts to apply for a Grant personally, without the assistance of a solicitor, the process requires significant extra support from the Probate Office. </p><p>The average waiting times in the District Probate Registries from first receipt to issue of Grant are set out in the table.<table><tr><th>District Probate Offices</th><th>Applications from solicitors </th><th>Applications from personal applicants </th></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>6 weeks</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>8-10 weeks</td><td>4-8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Mullingar</td><td>4-6 weeks</td><td>4-6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>10-12 weeks</td><td>6-8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>14 weeks</td><td>14 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>6 weeks</td><td>4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Clonmel</td><td>4 weeks</td><td>4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>8 weeks</td><td>8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>8 weeks</td><td>8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>4-6 weeks</td><td>6-8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>12 weeks</td><td>12-14 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>14-16 weeks</td><td>16 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>12 weeks</td><td>14 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>16 weeks</td><td>16 weeks</td></tr></table>The Courts Service has also advised me that it is aware of the lengthy waiting times for probate applications and particularly personal applications to the Probate Office in Dublin and is working to improve the situation.  Additional resources have been provided to the Probate Office and to address the current delays further additional resources are being made available.</p><p>The Courts Service is also aware of the variance in waiting times across District Probate Registries which is due to the volume of applications received at the Registries, the skill sets within the Registries and the operational priorities within the offices.  It is currently finalising a full review of the probate system and it is anticipated that a report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process will be presented by the end 2017. </p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that its statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide the number of probate applications which relate to residential homes.  This information could only be obtained by the examination of each individual application, which would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time which would not be warranted. </p></reply>

The Report was not carried forward by the Government of the day.  The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged, would require a detailed consideration of the merits and impacts in the public interest, including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer.  The areas of law involved include consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services.  Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels.  While not part of the current Legislation Programme, therefore, this remains a complex area of legislative reform that will require renewed and thorough consideration.  As such, I will continue to bear it in mind for discussion and possible action in the general context of any upcoming reforms in the civil justice area. </p></reply>

The offence is punishable by summary conviction to a Class A fine or a term of imprisonment of 12 months or both.  </p>  <p>  As a result, it would be contrary to national law for I or my Department officials to provide information which pertains to the applicant or their application. Even to confirm that an application has been made would be to identify the individual as an applicant.  The Chief International Protection Officer and his team of International Protection Officers are also bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 26 of the 2015 Act to protect the identity of the applicant. </p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why the individual circumstances pertaining to applications for international protection require that the very strictest rules of confidentiality are upheld to ensure the identity of those who apply for international protection is not revealed, either directly or indirectly.  In particular, it is important to note that the authorities of some countries of origin may engage in the monitoring of the activities of their nationals abroad. The very act of making an application for international protection, which alleges persecution by the State, is viewed in some jurisdictions as an act of disloyalty or aggression by that person against their country of origin.  This could lead to remaining families and relatives of such applicants becoming a target.  </p>  <p>  Where an applicant or their designated legal adviser wishes to obtain information in relation to their application they can contact the International Protection Office directly either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2. </p>  <p>  These provisions only relate to international protection applicants. </p>  <p>  Queries in respect of other application types may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

These represent the latest two of a series of five reports which the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been obliged to prepare, including on foot of a number of public consultations, under the 2015 Act over the first year from its date of establishment on 1 October 2016. The Authority has been obliged to complete this component of its work within the tight deadlines stipulated in the Act. I also understand that it is engaged in ongoing consideration and consultation in relation to a number of the matters concerned. </p>  <p>  The subject matter of these reports and consultations relates to the new alternative business models for the provision of legal services which are among those structural reforms covered by the 2015 Act. Namely, Legal Partnerships (solicitor-barrister or barrister-barrister partnerships - solicitors can already operate partnerships) and, as the Deputy has pointed out, Multi-Disciplinary Practices (where lawyers and non-legal service providers can offer their services together) and certain matters relating to barristers such as allowing direct access to a barrister on contentious business or allowing them to hold clients' monies. At present my Department is continuing to work with the Regulatory Authority towards the early introduction of Legal Partnerships once the necessary regulatory and working capacities of the Authority can be put in place. </p>  <p>  As with the previous reports submitted by the Authority on these areas of structural reform under the 2015 Act, the latest two reports raised by the Deputy are in the process of being laid before the Houses and I expect this to be completed in the next week. </p></reply>

A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>In addition, the Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda Fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet and this is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.  In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.</p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor. </p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 92,040 targeted checkpoints and 71,700 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,130 arrests and 6,920 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  </p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.</p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. </p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations.  These include the well-established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate in the Scheme can find more details at </p><p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy, and I will contact him directly when this information is to hand.</p></reply>

Upon approval of the grant, the applicant will receive an up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational.  Some &euro;1 million was secured in Budget 2017 for the purposes of the Scheme and it is envisaged that a similar amount will be made available in 2018 and 2019. </p><p>Full details of the Scheme, including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie. </p><p>I would draw attention, in particular, to some of the key requirements of the Scheme which require that the proposal must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as Data Controller &ndash; this is a long-standing statutory requirement, set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 289 of 2006), for the establishment of community CCTV systems generally, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner in accordance with Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. </p><p>This Scheme is based extensively on the previous grant-aid Scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of my Department between 2005 and 2013 under which some 45 Community-based CCTV systems were established operating in a mix of urban and rural environments.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the number of applications received to date is well below expectations.  To date, 6 applications have been received, in addition to a significant number of enquiries about the Scheme.  As these applications were incomplete, they were returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant-aid.  </p><p>Guidance is available to help local groups in both rural and urban areas to apply for this important funding and I am keen to ensure that groups take full advantage of the availability of this funding.</p></reply>

There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.   </p>  <p>  The number of Inspectors, Sergeants, Garda&iacute; and civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na each year between 2013 and 2017, by Division as of 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Commissioner, is being collated by my Department and I will send this directly to the Deputy once it is to hand.</p></reply>

Both are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland is obliged to monitor their populations and report to the European Commission on their conservation status.  A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both species since 2009.  The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in June 2013 and is available on the website <i>www.npws.ie.</i></p><p>As part of my Department's established seal monitoring programme, Grey Seal and Harbour Seal numbers have continued to be recorded around the country.  The most recent survey data from County Donegal, including the western shores of Lough Foyle, was collected in August of this year and is currently undergoing analysis.  This process and the resulting report are expected to be complete in 2018.</p><p>Seals have a broad diet which varies depending on the species of seal, the geographic region and also the availability of fish and other prey.  Studies of the interaction between seals and various commercial fisheries in Ireland are ongoing.  This work by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Marine Institute and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, towards which my Department provides technical and licensing input under relevant conservation legislation, includes the recording of seal depredation (damage to fish or removal of fish by seals during fishery operations) as part of the National At Sea Catch Sampling Programme.  It also involves targeted regionally based studies concerning seal bycatch for example and the ongoing development of acoustic deterrence to mitigate seal fisheries interactions. </p><p>In relation to seal predation on salmonids, a study published in 2014 by Inland Fisheries Ireland, focusing on two estuaries of significance for native salmon, found considerable differences in the amount of salmonids in the diet of locally occurring seals and concluded that the removal of salmonids by seals and other predators must be placed in the context of the amount removed by fisheries </p><p>(<i>). </i></p><p>All of these studies will continue to inform policy in relation to seal protection and meeting our obligations under the EU Habitats Directive.</p></reply>

The programme is being led by my Department in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations (including the National Cultural Institutions), media organisations and relevant NGOs.  The launch document for the programme outlines five specific pillars:</p><p>1. Enabling the Creative Potential of Every Child</p><p>2. Enabling Creativity in Every Community</p><p>3. Investing in our Creative and Cultural Infrastructure</p><p>4. Ireland as a centre of Excellence in Media Production</p><p>5.

It aims to put creativity at the centre of public policy. </p><p>The Programme embraces the whole cultural sector, bringing together all those involved in the arts, film, broadcasting, visual arts, cultural heritage, the Irish language and Gaeltacht, with Government Departments and State agencies.</p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured &euro;5 m to commence the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme, further details of which are available on .  Implementation of the Programme is underpinned by three essential operating principles -  collaboration and communication, community empowerment and internationalisation. </p><p>The Programme is not a funding body and as such does not administer any grant or funding schemes.  However, my Department, in order to communicate the vision and values that underpin the Creative Ireland Programme, has taken the opportunity in this, its initial year, to collaborate with several key cultural partners at various important events and festivals nationwide.  This partnership approach has encouraged deeper understanding and appreciation of both the Programme itself and the role of the creative arts in our society. </p><p>In addition, in order to enable community empowerment, my Department allocated a sum of &euro;1 m to the local authorities to enable them to develop Culture and Creativity Action Plans and an associated programme of events and initiatives in each county.  This was bolstered by an additional &euro;1 m from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. </p><p>Furthermore, considerable resources were devoted to promoting the Programme and its vision to an international audience both online and through specifically commissioned media content, which has allowed us to articulate our values and our unique culture on the world stage. </p><p>It is important to note that the delivery of the Programme, while under the aegis of my Department, will primarily be through, and in collaboration with existing agencies, the Arts Council, Irish Film Board, Government Departments, local authorities, cultural institutions, and other cultural partners, and does not seek to supplant any existing funding mechanisms or schemes or influence art funding decisions. </p></reply>

All boards have a duty to ensure that their bodies comply with statutory requirements and to ensure that their staff can work in a safe and respectful environment.  These are HR matters which are the responsibility of the management of each independent institution.</p>  <p>  In recent times, as we know, there have been a number of alarming allegations and reports about sexual harassment in the workplace relating to the arts community.  That is why I identified a number of actions that I can take as Minister in relation to the bodies reporting to my Department.  The intention is to help boards fulfil their functions more effectively, and to support them in ensuring that policies in relation to equality and respect in the workforce operate effectively in line with best practice.  These include:</p>  <p>  - Arranging separate dedicated workshops for board members and senior staff with a particular emphasis on issues relating to bullying, abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace;</p>  <p>  - Extending an invitation to all other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country to avail of similar training; and</p>  <p>  - Highlighting once again to bodies reporting to the Department the nature of their legal obligations, by seeking assurances of their compliance with obligations under employment legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition, I will accelerate a planned review of compliance by bodies under the aegis of my Department with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p>  <p>  More broadly, I have been engaging with the Arts Council and the National Theatre to facilitate an industry wide consultation exercise to be held before the end of the month.  As I have said I believe that working together my Department, the Arts Council and leading members of theatre organisations can encourage a safe and respectful environment free from abuse of power and sexual harassment.</p></reply>

Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  In Budget 2018, I allocated a further &euro;1.55 million to the Irish Film Board to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.  This increases its annual budget by 9.3% to &euro;18 million, 29% more than it was in 2014.</p><p>The Film Board supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.</p><p>The Film Board also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.  Information on its funding scheme is available on the Irish Film Board website at <i>www.irishfilmboard.ie.</i></p><p>The other primary mechanism through which the Government supports the film industry is Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme.  My Department&rsquo;s investment in the film sector will also help to maximise the benefits brought about by the Government&rsquo;s enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system, including the decision to increase the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects to &euro;70 million, as announced as part of Budget 2016.</p><p>The twin approach of direct funding and tax expenditure measures maximises the benefits of the Government&rsquo;s support to the audiovisual industry.</p></reply>

My Department officials continue to work with relevant Departments and other stakeholders to develop this plan.  The plan will be a primary driver of actions in this area in 2018.</p><p>In addition, the Arts Council commissioned report <i>Arts and Cultural Participation among Children and Young People: Insights from the Growing Up in Ireland Study</i>, which was published in September 2016, concluded that arts and cultural participation leads to a range of positive outcomes for children, both in terms of their cognitive development and their well-being.  This study found that schools are important arenas for access to arts/culture and school emphasis on culture has a positive impact on student engagement in these activities.</p><p>It should be noted that under the Arts Act 2003, primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  This year the Arts Council increased funding in this area from &euro;3.1 m in 2016 to &euro;3.7 m in 2017 on foot of the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017.  This will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).  This strategy places specific emphasis on the need to plan and provide for children and young people.</p><p>Regarding the appreciation of local history and heritage among schoolchildren, the Heritage Council operates the Heritage in Schools Scheme.  This makes available to primary schools a current panel of 145 Heritage Experts who visit primary schools to work directly with the pupils.  The scheme currently reaches nearly 100,000 primary school pupils over the course of 2,000 school visits each year.  The value of the scheme is in the richness and depth of knowledge it makes available to children and teachers, engaging children in a direct experience of their heritage, preferably outside the classroom where possible and appropriate.  The Heritage Council has just completed a review of the Scheme and appointed new Experts who will achieve a greater geographical spread and will enable the scheme place more emphasis on built heritage supporting efforts to promote the historic values of towns.</p><p>In terms of next steps in this area, my Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Youth and Children Affairs and the Arts Council in preparing the Creative Children plan to deliver the objectives of Pillar 1 of the Creative Ireland Programme.  This plan will be launched later in the year.</p></reply>

The Creative Ireland Programme is a high level, high ambition, 5-year initiative, from 2017 to 2022 which is the centenary of the foundation of the State.  Creative Ireland aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy.  The programme is being led by my Department in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations and relevant NGOs.  The second pillar of Creative Ireland entitled Enabling Creativity in Every Community is focused on local communities.  I am pleased to report that there has been significant progress on Pillar 2.  A Culture Team has been established in each of the 31 local authorities and each local authority has produced a 2017 Creative Ireland Plan and is in the process of drawing up a more detailed 2018 Creative Plan setting out a five year plan for local creativity.</p><p>In general, funding for the arts is primarily a matter for the Arts Council.  In this regard, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budgets 2017 and 2018.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation over 2017 and 2018 is &euro;8 million and this additional funding will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy <i>Making Great Art Work (2016-2025).</i>Based on this strategy the Arts Council has developed a new approach to funding known as <i>Making Great Art Work Funding Framework 2018-2020</i>.  The Arts Council has identified five funding categories that will enable it to deliver on its strategic goals.  This includes the provision of funding to support local authorities in delivering arts experiences to people across Ireland.</p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by significant investment in arts and culture infrastructure.  Already this year I announced details of more than &euro;10 million in capital funding to a total of 122 arts organisations around the country under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018.  This is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

This review is examining the available evidence and consulting with relevant stakeholder groups.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the PRAC&rsquo;s review of valproate will be concluded before the end of this year. As soon as the review is concluded, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland, will communicate the outcome and recommendations of the review to Irish patients, healthcare professionals and relevant stakeholders, including the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE's Medicines Management Programme (MMP) is already actively involved in this area. Following a previous EMA review of valproate in 2014, the MMP convened a working group with representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Epilepsy and Mental Health to review available resources for the safe use of valproate in females. The MMP also consulted with the HPRA, the drug&rsquo;s manufacturer, and with relevant patient groups. </p>  <p>  In October 2016, the MMP launched its Valproate Toolkit, an online resource consisting of a patient information booklet, summary guide for prescribers and a patient/prescriber checklist. This information highlights that sodium valproate should not be prescribed to girls or women of childbearing age or pregnant women unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. The MMP is in contact with the HPRA regarding the EMA's current review of valproate, and any further safety recommendations will receive appropriate consideration.</p>  <p>  A research paper published in 2016 indicated that the use of sodium valproate in pregnancy declined between 2008 and 2013 in Ireland, based on the number of female patients aged 16-44 years who were dispensed the drug under the community drug schemes. A follow-on analysis of HSE pharmacy claims data from January 2014 to August 2016 indicates a decline (from approximately 2000 patients to fewer than 1700 patients) in the number of women aged 16-44 years who were dispensed sodium valproate medicines under community drug schemes in that period. The HSE continues to monitor the use of sodium valproate in women of childbearing age via its Medicines Management Programme.</p>  <p>  The HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division has developed the National Clinical Programme for Epilepsy, to provide the best value, safe care for all people with epilepsy in the right place, at the right time, sharing the best information available. The model of care under the national clinical programme includes the development of a very detailed protocol for the effective management of women with epilepsy. This protocol has been developed with input from the neurology, obstetric and  paediatric specialties, but is intended for all healthcare professionals. It will cover the pathways of care and clinical issues associated with all aspects of pregnancy, contraception and menopause in epilepsy, as well as the responsibilities for clinical staff in relation to detailed management. It will include detailed support for the obstetrics service in the management of seizures and guidance for ante-natal care, including prescribing protocols and specific information covering the known extra risks of epilepsy associated with pregnancy to both the mother and foetus.</p>  <p>  This practice guide for the management of women with epilepsy is for consideration and approval by the HSE before the end of 2017.</p></reply>

However, since CBD is not psychoactive it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, therefore does not require a licence.  CBD oil is not authorised as a medicinal product, however, it is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement.</p>  <p>  THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation products containing THC are strictly controlled and possession is unlawful except under licence. </p>  <p>  Under the existing legislation it is open to the Minister for Health to grant a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner for access to medical cannabis containing THC for a named patient.  The granting of a licence is based on submission of an application to the Minister which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of treatment over time.  To date two such applications for two separate individuals have been successful.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is the decision of the prescribing clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe any particular treatment, including cannabis, for a patient under their care.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the clinical decision making process.</p>  <p>  Any consultant requiring information or clarification in relation to the licence application process should contact the Department of Health directly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in March 2017, on foot of the conclusions from the Health Products Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review&rsquo;, I established an Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group is tasked with the development of clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  A critical requirement for the successful establishment of the Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance.  This has involved continuous ongoing dialogue between the Experts and third parties throughout this initiative.  The Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidance, which has now been finalised.  The Expert Group are also considering other operational aspects for the implementation of the Access Programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme and on the logistics of sourcing suitable cannabis-based product supplies for the Irish market place.  This work will take a number of months to complete.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  In line with the legislation there are three main steps to the application process.</p>  <p>Step 1 is an application for a Care Needs Assessment.  The Care Needs Assessment identifies whether or not the person needs long-term nursing home care.</p>  <p>Step 2 is an application for State Support.  This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his/her corresponding level of financial assistance (&ldquo;State Support&rdquo;).  The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care.</p>  <p>Step 3 is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme.</p>  <p>  Applicants to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's particular need.  The HSE's Nursing Homes Support Offices can advise an applicant or their family on the options available to them. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for the NHSS an applicant must be deemed to be in need of full time care.  There are no provisions to share NHSS funding between the nursing home and the applicants home.</p></reply>

In order for an applicant to be eligible for the NHSS they must be deemed to be in need of long term nursing home care during the Care Needs Assessment stage of the application process.  As the scheme was particularly designed, including in law, for residential care there are no provisions within the scheme for an applicant to remain at home as referred to by the Deputy in her question.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to promoting care in the community so that people can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  There have been calls to extend the NHSS to cover home care services.  However the Government is committed to establishing a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.</p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.    </p>  <p>  A public consultation on home care services was launched by Minister the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris and myself on 6 July and closed on 2 October 2017.  The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including service-users, their families, and healthcare workers.  It also allowed the Department to find out what people think about current home care services as well as the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  Approximately 2,600 submissions were received.  A report of the findings of this consultation process will be published early next year and the findings will be used by the Department in the development of the new home care scheme. </p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  A significant amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.</p></reply>

The Directive applies to all EEA nationals who wish to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications. This includes Irish citizens who study in any of the EEA Member States, including the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, who seek to practise their profession in Ireland.</p>  <p>  When approving the qualifications of those seeking registration as a social worker, the Social Workers Registration Board is bound by the legislation under which it was established - the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Section 38 of the Act requires that an applicant, inter alia, holds an approved qualification to be eligible for registration. </p>  <p>  Approved qualifications fall into three categories. They are qualifications that are:</p>  <p>  - awarded in the State; or</p>  <p>  - held by a person to whom Directive 2005/36/EC applies and who is recognised in accordance with the provisions of that Directive; or </p>  <p>  - held by a person to whom the Directive does not apply and who does not have a qualification awarded within the State but who has been adjudged to meet the required standards by the Social Workers Registration Board.</p>  <p>  EEA nationals who hold qualifications awarded in Northern Ireland fall into category b).  As Directive 2005/36/EC provides for an assessment of an applicant's formal training and post-qualification professional experience, no two applications are the same; applications are therefore assessed on a case by case basis. I am advised by CORU that the application fee (which is in line with that charged by other competent authorities) is calculated on a cost basis to cover the administration, expert assessment and decision making.</p>  <p>  CORU, which supports the work of the Social Workers Registration Board, continuously seeks to improve and streamline procedures undertaken in accordance with the Directive.</p>  <p>  The process for recognising teaching qualifications awarded in Northern Ireland was referred to in the details supplied with this question.  In this regard, the Teaching Council has advised that all applications for recognition of qualifications obtained outside the Republic of Ireland are assessed on a case by case basis in accordance with Directive 2005/36/EC; there is no system of automatic recognition in place.</p></reply>

The national policy covers the period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. The Policy acknowledged that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity, and emphasised the key role that the education sector will have in achieving the objectives, particularly in relation to child obesity.</p>  <p>  The Obesity Policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. Under each step there are a number of actions, some of which have been identified for early implementation. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of areas of early implementation are of particular interest with reference to child obesity:</p>  <p>  - My Department has established an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group. The national Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) - under the Chair of my Department - is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the OPIOG held its inaugural meeting on the 19th of October last with further meetings to be arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP). The OPIOG will identify processes for engaging with networks of stakeholders. It will elaborate on this aspect of its functions over the course of its work to implement the OPAP that runs up to 2025.</p>  <p>  -The Minister for Finance has announced in Budget 2018 the introduction of a sugar tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. The policy objective of this levy is to reduce rates of obesity, as well as rates of dental deterioration particularly in young people.</p>  <p>  - My Department has been engaging with the food industry, including food retailers, on a Code of Practice to reduce the marketing of products high in fat, sugar and salt, with a particular aim to reduce consumption of such products by children and young people. This voluntary Code of Practice for Non-Broadcast Media Advertising and Marketing of Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages, including Sponsorship and Retail Product Placement, will be launched in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  - I recently launched a new child obesity campaign from safefood and the HSE It's called the START campaign and it aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity. The first phase of the campaign advertising features on TV, radio, video on demand, outdoor and digital platforms.</p>  <p>  - New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines earlier this month to all primary and post-primary schools.  Work has now commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group. </p>  <p>  - New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed. These Nutrition Standards were launched by the Ministers for Health, Education and Skills, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection in September 2017. The development and implementation of these Standards meets commitments in the DEIS Action Plan as well as the Obesity Policy. </p>  <p>  - Other developments in the HSE, through a new Healthy Eating, Active Living programme will support work in the education sector, as well as with parents, families and communities in supporting a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity.</p></reply>

Supports for childcare, including pre-school education, are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Early intervention classes are available for children aged 3-5 with a diagnosis of ASD. Early intervention classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school. Where such a placement is not available home tuition can be provided.</p><p>In order to access an early intervention class, children aged between 3 and 4 years of age must have an ASD diagnosis and children over 4 years of age (who will not reach the age of 6 during the school year) must have a recommendation from a relevant professional for an early intervention placement. Following early intervention, children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class or a placement in a special school. The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) website.  The SENO can also advise parents in relation to supports which may be available to support children with special educational needs, including special transport arrangements which may be made available. </p><p>The purpose of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children with Special Educational Needs who are seeking an educational placement, either in a special school, a special class, including an early intervention class within a mainstream school, or a mainstream class in a mainstream school, with additional resources allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  </p><p>In the event that no placement is available, home tuition can only be provided until such a placement becomes available. Home tuition is provided as an interim provision only and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a place in school. Details of the Scheme are available at <i><i></i></i>.</p><p>Furthermore, I note your concerns regarding the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) and I have forwarded these to my colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs who are the Department responsible for AIM.

An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. </p>  <p>  Part 8 of the Act also provides a mechanism through which an adult with capacity (i.e. the directive-maker) may nominate in his or her AHD a legal representative to be involved in the healthcare decision-making process on his or her behalf if he or she was to subsequently lose capacity. This nominee is known as the designated healthcare representative. </p>  <p>  The Act includes specific provisions outlining the functions and scope of authority of a designated healthcare representative.

The Director will subsequently prepare a code of Practice and will submit it to me for my approval and, with my consent, the Director will then publish the code of practice.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.

The extension followed a comprehensive review by the European Food Safety Authority.  This review, which included detailed consideration of a report produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation, concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.</p>  <p>  The RAC concluded in March 2017, in an opinion adopted with the full support of all members, that glyphosate does not warrant classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction.  A final decision on renewing the approval of glyphosate is due to be taken by 15 December 2017.</p>  <p>  Based on the conclusions of the risk and hazard assessments conducted by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency the Commission has prepared draft proposals for renewal of the approval of glyphosate.  These proposals have been discussed by Member State representatives at technical experts standing committee meetings but there has not been qualified majority support at these meetings for the draft renewal proposals that have been presented by the Commission.</p>  <p>  All plant protection product uses (including glyphosate) are monitored via my Department&rsquo;s annual pesticide residue monitoring programme.  The programme enforces EU legislation establishing the maximum permitted concentration of pesticide residues in food, or Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs), and aims to ensure that consumers are not exposed to unacceptable risks from pesticide residues and is agreed with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the European Commission.  The programme involves the sampling of produce at distribution centres, retailers, and other storage and processing premises, and also includes processed food samples.  These samples are analysed for up to 400 pesticides including glyphosate. Glyphosate has not been detected in these samples at levels in excess of the Maximum Residue Level allowed.</p></reply>

I am glad to say that Michel Barnier and the relevant Member States are as determined as Ireland in that regard.</p>  <p>  Existing access arrangements and percentage shares of fish stocks have been agreed by all EU Member States, including the UK, over many years and were most recently affirmed in 2014 when the current Common Fisheries Policy came into force.  I see no basis whatsoever for the kind of reordering of the current arrangements apparently sought by some in the UK. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting UK Secretary of State Gove at the end of this month and I will be setting out our position.  </p>  <p>  My position is absolutely clear &ndash; I will not accept any change in the current access and sharing arrangements to the detriment of Ireland's and the EU&rsquo;s fishing communities. </p>  <p>  We would all like higher quotas but the way to achieve that is to grow the stocks through sustainable management for the benefit of all.</p>  <p>  If and when the UK finally leaves the EU they should equally retain their current shares and entitlements.  We are not asking that they lose their rights of access to EU waters or face any reductions in their current shares and see no reason why we should lose ours.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been an enormous amount of work on this issue in terms of analysing potential impacts for our fishing industries under the various possible scenarios since well before the UK referendum.  This work has been carried out by my Department, the Marine Institute and BIM  in close cooperation with the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  At EU level there have been, and will continue to be, regular contacts with the Barnier Task Force, Fisheries Commissioner Vella and likeminded Member States at all levels.  In all of these contacts I have stressed the importance of a unified EU front and our determination to maintain all of our current rights.  This is a view shared by all of those Member States that have rights in the UK zone.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that once the negotiations progress beyond the first phase, I aim to ensure that fisheries are inextricably linked to overall discussions on the totality of the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

I urged farmers and all people in rural areas to follow closely the advice of the authorities particularly for those in the worst affected Counties. My key concern was for the safety of people and I reiterated the advice that only essential travel should be undertaken.  </p><p>I also reminded landowners of the dangers of fallen trees and power lines and advised that assessment of damage in such circumstances should only be carried out by appropriately trained professionals from the relevant front line services. </p><p>In light of the red weather alert being extended to the entire country, it was decided that in the interest of safety all Departmental offices would remain closed on Monday 16<sup>th</sup>October, the day of the storm.</p><p>My Department is a member of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and will contribute to a report that is being prepared by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the overall response to Storm Ophelia.  This report will be considered by the Taskforce before being submitted for the consideration of Government in January 2018.</p></reply>

I will continue to fully support this programme throughout the lifetime of the current RDP. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I re-opened BDGP for beef suckler farmers who were not already participating in the scheme. This scheme (BDGP II) provides for six years of payments to farmers for completion of actions which deliver accelerated genetic improvement in the national herd and improvement of its environmental sustainability. Payment rates and actions for participants in BDGP II are the same as those in the original scheme, with the exception that the training and carbon navigator actions must be completed by 31st October 2017. </p>  <p>  Any increase in the payment under the BDGP would require approval from the EU Commission. This would be very difficult in the context of an innovative scheme which has undergone an approval process relatively recently. Even in the event that such approval was obtained, it would be necessary to require farmers to undertake additional actions to justify any additional payment, making the scheme more complex and compliance more onerous. </p>  <p>  The suckler sector is a vital component of Ireland's rural economy and the provision of support for the suckler sector is critically important. The range of supports as currently configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and rural development measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability. I believe that it is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supports into the future.</p>  <p>  I should also point out there a range of other supports available to suckler farmers under the RDP, notably GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer groups.</p></reply>

Operational matters relating to the company&rsquo;s retail business, including the post office network, are matters for the Board and management of An Post.  I appreciate that there is concern regarding the potential closure of post offices and the potential number involved.  However, I am advised that no definitive decision has been made by An Post regarding post office closures.</p>  <p>  An Post has carried out a fundamental review of the company to identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to put the company on a sound financial footing. In this context, An Post has looked at the future of the post office network with a view to ensuring a sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates. Any changes in this area will have to be the subject of negotiation between An Post and the Postmasters. I continue to encourage An Post to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network. I understand that the specific report referred to by the Deputy is under consideration by An Post in the context of the review. It is expected that Government will be briefed shortly on the strategic review. Until such time it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have any budget allocation for An Post in 2018.</p></reply>

This is purely an estimate which is based on the cost (range) of the total level of transfers that might be required for Ireland on the basis of assumptions about the level of achievement of renewable generation in Ireland by 2020 (% and absolute renewable deployment across heat, transport and electricity), and the estimated cost per unit shortfall required to be purchased as statistical transfers. These costs vary widely given the uncertainty around the future market price for statistical transfers. The estimate is based on published costs of deployment of UK onshore wind (low end estimates) and offshore wind (high level estimate) available in early 2016 from UK sources. These assumptions were chosen as a reasonable basis as they represent a transfer of prevailing costs from another Member State and they will be kept under review taking account of factors such as the available supply and market costs.</p>  <p>  Any requirement for statistical transfers to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States. As any purchases arising would be made over an extended period, the costs of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of more than one year and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases. </p>  <p>  While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, contingency planning has commenced in the Department to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of acquiring statistical transfers.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get access to high speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.  </p>  <p>  The Map is searchable by Eircode/address and is colour coded:</p>  <p>  - AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p>  <p>  - BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering, or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018, as part of an Agreement signed with me in April. </p>  <p>  According to the Map the eircode referenced is in an AMBER area and will be covered by the State Intervention under the NBP.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a bidder or bidders who will roll-out the new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. My Department's specialist National Broadband Plan (NBP) team are now engaged in evaluating the &lsquo;Detailed Solutions&rsquo; received from the two bidders in September 2017 as part of that competitive procurement process. This is the last stage of the procurement before receipt of final tenders and progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s). </p>  <p>  To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Solar PV, Anaerobic Digestion, Wind Energy at various scales including small and micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. </p>  <p>  These guidelines limit the financial support options for national renewable electricity (RES-E) support schemes. In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price. This support mechanism is very different to current schemes in place in Ireland where all renewable electricity generators within specific sectors get a fixed price for the electricity they export to the national grid. In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses have been a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p>  <p>  A cornerstone of the new scheme will be the provision of pathways for increased community ownership, participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects. This approach will deliver on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland. Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken. The most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.</p>  <p>  Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country. My Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation last month and will develop a policy position on how best to support micro generation and micro generators in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4th September and recently closed on November 10th. All submissions will be considered in informing the final design of the RESS and following on from this public consultation and review, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to know that the Economic Report to underpin the design of the new scheme and the Community Report which identifies and assesses renewable electricity community policies and measures have both been published as part of the public consultation process. Both reports and associated data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dccae.ie </p>  <p>  At this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. I welcome and have noted with interest the falling costs of some renewable technologies over the past year, most notably Solar PV and offshore wind. Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p></reply>

It is not the intention to alter the REFIT schemes in such a way as to undermine investment in the renewable energy sector.  However, nor is it the intention to ignore the requirements and principles of the new market design, and introduce a solution that could effectively immunise some 30% of the installed generation portfolio from the new market arrangements, and place disproportionate demands on the PSO levy.  The Department is seeking to design a balanced solution to this matter such that the financing arrangements for renewable energy projects are not undermined while at the same time avoiding excessive costs being placed on electricity consumers.  </p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.  </p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area.  The Map is searchable by eircode.  </p><p>- AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process.  </p><p>- BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering, or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018, as part of an Agreement signed with me in April.  </p><p>The eircode referenced by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area on the High Speed Broadband Map and will be covered by the State led intervention under the NBP.  </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.  </p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and rollout.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.  </p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention.  </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The BAI's mission is to ensure a competitive, sustainable, high quality broadcasting sector in Ireland offering diversity of choice.  The Authority regulates the public and commercial broadcasting sectors.  </p><p>Some of the areas covered by the BAI&rsquo;s remit include:</p><p>- Enforcement, including the power to apply to the courts to impose financial sanctions on broadcasters up to a maximum sanction of &euro;250,000 for serious or repeated breaches of broadcasting standards.  </p><p>- Licensing of broadcasting services.  </p><p>- Consumer protection, including the promotion of media literacy; providing information on the availability of digital television services; preparing codes and rules including those relating to advertising, children&rsquo;s advertising, etc.  </p><p>- Oversight of public service broadcasting, including requirements to review RT&Eacute; and TG4's performance and making recommendation on their funding.  </p><p>Further information about BAI role and functions can be found on its website at <i>www.bai.ie</i>or by contacting their offices at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2 D02 XP29  Tel 01 6441200.  </p></reply>

The scheme is being piloted in Community Healthcare Organisation 7 and is open to people aged 55 and over or 12 and under who are living with chronic respiratory conditions in households that are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance or the One-Parent Family Payment.</p><p>I have allocated &euro;20m to the pilot scheme under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty.  It began in mid-2016 and will run for the rest of 2017 and 2018.  An independent research project will assess the impact the scheme is having.  At the conclusion of the scheme, and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider rollout will be considered.  The funding to the scheme should provide for the upgrade of at least 1,500 homes.  This is the minimum size needed to develop the evidence base on the impact on the health outcomes of participants of making their homes more energy efficient and warmer, and make the business case for a wider rollout of the scheme. </p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health under the Healthy Ireland framework.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive are working together to deliver the scheme.  The HSE have set up a dedicated team to recruit participants to the Warmth and Wellbeing scheme.  They determine eligibility for every person who makes contact with them about the scheme before referring only the eligible applicants to the SEAI.  Working with the HSE means that the SEAI do not receive applications from people who are not eligible for the scheme.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2017 the HSE team has received approximately 700 queries in relation to the scheme.  Of these, just over 500 have been deemed eligible and have been referred on to SEAI to have surveys carried out on their homes and subsequent energy efficiency works.  The scheme is still open for applications and will continue to run in 2018.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is available on a nationwide basis to low income households who are at risk of energy poverty.  More information on this scheme is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>or Freephone: 1800 250 204.  </p></reply>

The scheme provides a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the eligibility criteria.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.</p><p>Eligibility for the scheme is open to household who meet the following criteria:</p><p>- Owner occupied, non-local authority home;</p><p>- Home built pre-2006;</p><p>- Household in receipt of one of the following payments;</p><p>- Fuel Allowance as part of the National Fuel Scheme;</p><p>- Family Income Supplement;</p><p>- Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for over 6 months and have a child aged under 7 years;</p><p>- One Parent Family Payment.</p><p>Works provided under the scheme are carried out by an SEAI-appointed panel of non-profit Community Based Organisations (CBOs), supplemented with a panel of private contractors to ensure a nationwide spread of recipients.</p><p>The SEAI recruits people to the scheme in a number of ways.</p><p>- CBOs on the panel are encouraged to generate their own applications.  They do this through their links in the local community or through working with other organisations or groups who engage with vulnerable sectors of society such as St. Vincent de Paul, MABS or health care professionals;</p><p>- Mailshots drawing homeowners' attention to the availability of the scheme are sent by Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on behalf of SEAI to all recipients of the Fuel Allowance;</p><p>- General marketing and advertisement of the scheme on SEAI&rsquo;s website and social media.</p><p>To date, more than 130,000 homes have been upgraded through the scheme.  However, there are nearly 400,000 households in receipt of Fuel Allowance.  This suggests that is still a significant number of people who could be availing of this free upgrade.  I have asked the SEAI to examine additional means of finding people who may be eligible to ensure that these low income households are availing of these improvements that will help them to keep their homes warmer and manage their energy bills.</p></reply>

I understand that in 2017, &euro;7.2 million will be invested directly into High Performance programmes, with a further &euro;1.8 million available to support athletes under the International Carding Scheme which provides income support to elite athletes.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Sports Capital Programme, this is the Government&rsquo;s primary vehicle for supporting the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment. Grants are available to sports clubs, voluntary and community groups, national governing bodies of sports and local authorities.  The 2017 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on the 24th February. By the closing date, a record number of 2,320 applications seeking &euro;155 million in grants were received. When the programme was launched, it was envisaged that &euro;30m would be available which would have made the allocation of grants particularly challenging. Following the conclusion of the budget discussions, I am pleased that significant extra resources have been secured to allocate under this round. The increased funding will ensure that many additional projects, including facilities utilised by our high performance athletes, can now be funded. The assessment of all the 2,320 applications is now nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to announce full details of the allocations in the coming weeks</p></reply>

The decision in the early days of bus lanes to allow taxis to use with-flow bus lanes was based on the fact that they are available for on-street hire.  </p>  <p>  Since the creation of the bus lane network, there have been many requests to extend bus lanes to various other categories of traffic.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country.  I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5 m in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.  This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4m, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme is open to some 1,700 youth groups and clubs, with an estimated 90,000 club members around the country.  The scheme, which is open to new entrants, is advertised locally and applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  In 2017, I have provided an additional 10% in funding to the scheme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.1715.  The 2017 scheme has now closed.

To qualify for IP, claimants must have, inter alia, at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete contribution year before the date of their claim. Only PRSI classes A, E or H contributions are reckonable for IP purposes. </p>  <p>  A claimant must be regarded as permanently incapable of work, which is defined as: </p>  <p>  incapacity for work of such a nature that the likelihood is that the claimant will be incapable of work for life </p>  <p>  OR </p>  <p>  an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim, and where the Deciding Officer or an Appeals Officer is satisfied that the claimant is likely to be unable to work for at least a further 12 months </p>  <p>  Disability allowance (DA) is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  </p>  <p>  In order to determine a person&rsquo;s eligibility for IP it must be established that they meet both the PRSI contributions and the medical condition for receipt of payment. Where a person&rsquo;s contribution record is incomplete and they have been in receipt of another social welfare payment e.g. DA, it is necessary to investigate their entitlement to credited contributions. In addition to this, up to date medical evidence may be required in order to establish medical eligibility for IP. The applicant may be required to have a medical form completed by their GP or to attend for an in-person medical assessment. This process can take time depending on the circumstances of each case. </p>  <p>The gentleman concerned has been in receipt of disability allowance (DA) at the maximum personal rate   from 30 July 2014. An application for IP was received from the gentleman in question on 13 July 2017.   His DA payment, along with their fuel allowance and living alone allowance has continued while their eligibility for IP was being examined.</p>  <p>  Following an examination of his contribution record, his record has been updated with DA credits and it has now been established that he satisfies the contribution conditions for IP.  As it has also been determined that he satisfies the medical criteria, his claim for IP has been awarded with effect from 13 July 2017 and the first payment will issue to his nominated bank account on 23 November 2017.  Any arrears due from 13 July 2017 to 22 November 2017 (less any overlapping social welfare payment and/or outstanding overpayment) will issue in due course.  The gentleman in question was notified of this decision on 13 November 2017.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test for these schemes takes account of the income and assets of the person and a spouse/partner, if applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments. </p>  <p>  Maintenance payments (including maintenance payments made to or in respect of a qualified child) are assessed by first disregarding any housing costs incurred up to &euro;4,952 per annum (or &euro;95.23 per week), and then assessing the remainder at 50%. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total value of any maintenance payments is never assessed as means for these weekly income support payments and the total income received by the family (social welfare payment and maintenance payment combined) will be higher than someone not receiving maintenance payments.</p>  <p>  The method of assessment for maintenance payments was standardised in 2003.  Prior to this, the method of assessment varied from scheme to scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme was discontinued to new entrants from 1st January 2014.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that officials have been engaging with existing customers of the scheme to consider appropriate exit strategies and there has been a substantial reduction in the number of recipients, from some 5,880 in January 2014 to a current number of 1,440.  The longer term position and supports available to the remaining customers is under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped approximately 4,460 such borrowers.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide. The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service. The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 9,400 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of some 5,410 principle private residences.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are currently over 29,000 HAP tenancies in place of which c. 8,360 (c. 30%) are direct transfers from rent supplement.  In addition to the ongoing transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to HAP, the majority of new applicants seeking State support towards their rent are supported by Local Authorities through HAP rather than rent supplement.  The strategic goal as set out in Rebuilding Ireland is to transfer all long-term tenancies from rent supplement to HAP by 2020.  </p>  <p>  Rent supplement&rsquo;s forecast recipient base considers inter alia the impact of HAP; on-going transfers of rent supplement tenancies to other social housing options; and the general improvement in the macroeconomic environment.  Based on current transfer performance and on-going trends for the scheme, County Dublin&rsquo;s expected rent supplement decline for 2018 will be in the region of 5,400, a 31% reduction of the current Dublin base of c. 17,000 recipients; the decline expected is approximately 450 per month, 1,350 per quarter.  This trend is expected to continue through 2019, though dependent on Local Authorities continuing to provide exit opportunities for long term rent supplement tenancies and economic conditions prevailing.  The provision of this information on an individual Local Authority basis is not available.  </p></reply>

The purpose of all of these schemes is to improve someone&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  Schemes like CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of social welfare payments, including those on long-term unemployment payments.  However, placements on these schemes are not full-time sustainable jobs.</p>  <p>  Participation limits are set on these schemes to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons, to ensure the benefit of the work experience placement is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  In addition, it is generally recognised that there is a greater likelihood of a &lsquo;lock&ndash;in&rsquo; effect where a scheme is of a longer duration.</p>  <p>  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a scheme that allows persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments the opportunity to pursue a course of study and receive income support subject to satisfying a number of conditions.  </p>  <p>  A BTEA participant whose eligibility is based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with the rules of their primary payment.  Participants on BTEA can work during the summer months and recommence on the scheme at the beginning of the next academic year once they continue to maintain an entitlement to an underlying scheme.  The BTEA conditions were reviewed and updated following a review of all employment and educational supports schemes in 2012  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, issues such as the number of places and the criteria for participation on all activation schemes will be kept under review by my Department to ensure the best outcome for participants.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

From the outset, I should say that details of how all mobile phone service providers route their texts to destination addresses, in-state or internationally, is not information that my Department has or is responsible for.  The information provided to my Department by Vodafone Ireland is as follows: for recipients located in Ireland using an Irish operator, all Vodafone customers&rsquo; texts stay within Ireland using Vodafone Ireland&rsquo;s network platform.  Non-Vodafone customers&rsquo; texts are passed to the Vodafone Ireland network platform and then onto the recipient&rsquo;s network.  How and where they are routed thereafter is determined by the recipient&rsquo;s operator but it is a fair assumption that all major Irish operators keep their network platforms in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  For recipients located abroad using an Irish operator, texts are passed to Vodafone Ireland&rsquo;s network platform domestically and then delivered onto whatever roaming network the recipient may be on.  For Vodafone customers, this will be the Vodafone network platform in the country they are in or, where Vodafone does not have a network platform, Vodafone&rsquo;s roaming partner of choice.  For non-Vodafone customers, it depends entirely on their operator&rsquo;s routing rules.  </p>  <p>  For recipients located in Ireland using non-Irish operators, texts are passed to Vodafone Ireland who will then send it to the foreign numbers&rsquo; home operator who, presumably then passes them to their preferred network in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the response to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question on the matter on November 7, it is important to note that no personal information is shared in the provision of this service.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the interim, the pilot initiative which enables those aged 62 or over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits, providing the CE eligibility conditions are met is still in operation.  Participants are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by my Department.

Officials from my Department and Pobal engaged with Inishowen Development Partnership Limited, which has an unblemished record in administering state funding in the Inishowen area, to consider how the funding for the tourism service in Inishowen could be delivered.</p>  <p>  As a result of the discussions, it was decided that a new entity should be established comprising of the relevant community and tourism stakeholders in Inishowen.  Once established, the new entity could then submit a 12 month business plan for assessment by Pobal.  Following the assessment, Pobal would then make a recommendation to my Department and thereafter a decision would be made as to whether CSP funding for the tourism service in Inishowen could be delivered through the new entity.  </p>  <p>  Explore Inishowen CLG has been established but, to date, no business plan has been submitted for consideration by Pobal or my Department.  I want to reiterate to the Deputy that Explore Inishowen CLG is completely independent and separate from Inishowen Development Partnership Limited.</p>  <p>  According to Inishowen Development Partnership Limited, only one of those listed was a director of the company following the AGM of the company held on 5 December 2016.  The others listed did not seek re-election and formally stepped down as directors of the company at the AGM.</p>  <p>  This is recorded in the minutes of the company&rsquo;s AGM.  I understand that the information regarding the directors of Inishowen Development Partnership Limited was uploaded onto the CRO website on 6 September 2017 and the relevant papers were submitted by post to the CRO on 12 September 2017, in advance of the filing deadline of 14 September 2017.</p>  <p>  The individual director who remains on the board of Inishowen Development Partnership Limited was elected at the last community elections held by the company and was formally adopted at the company&rsquo;s AGM on 5 December 2016.  He was one of 19 board members of Inishowen Development Partnership Limited at the time the CSP funding was removed from Inishowen Tourism Society Limited on 30 June 2017.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are weekly payments, based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.5 billion.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the acting and artistic professions and people in these professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed.  The pilot initiative, which is a key commitment under the Creative Ireland Programme, assists self-employed visual artists and writers who apply to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for jobseekers allowance.</p>  <p>  Applicants must satisfy all of the usual qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Under this new mechanism, the Department provides for the classification of self-employed professional artists and writers who are then not subject to the activation process for 12 months.</p>  <p>  At the end of October 2017 there were 15 people in receipt of jobseeker allowance who have availed of the initiative.  There are a number of reasons why any applicant might not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, such as not satisfying the means test.  It is not possible to identify the profession of those who applied for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance but who did not qualify for the scheme for whatever reason.</p></reply>

These Regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.</p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from a portion of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;34 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections were carried out during this period.  The Department offers a subvention to local authorities to carry out inspection of properties under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations.  Funding is dispersed on the basis of &euro;100 per inspection carried out and &euro;50 per follow-up inspection that achieves compliance.</p>  <p>  However, the Rental Strategy recognises the need for additional resources to be provided to local authorities to aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations.  Provision has been made for an additional &euro;2.5m in 2018, with the intention of providing further increases each year in the period to 2021 to facilitate a targeted inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties annually.</p>  <p>  It is also my intention to introduce further measures to ensure that landlords meet their obligations in relation to quality and safety and compliance with regulations and standards.  When registering a tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), landlords will be required to certify that the property in question is compliant with regulations relating to standards for rental accommodation, overcrowding and fire safety.

A copy of the announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>ttp://www.housing.gov.ie/planning/guidelines/wind-energy/coveney-and-naughten-announce-key-development-review-wind-energy-development-guidelines</i>.</p><p>As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) will be undertaken on the &quot;proposed draft approach&quot; to the revised Guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months and tendering to engage consultants to carry out that process is currently underway.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until the first half of 2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p><p>In relation to solar farms, there are no specific planning guidelines in place. Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p><p>I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments. However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p></reply>

The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) collects rents from all HAP tenants and makes all HAP rental payments to landlords on behalf of the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  There are minimal barriers to setting up HAP.  In order to support eligible households immediately, which is a key principle of the HAP scheme and in order to remove barriers to the commencement of HAP support, landlords self-certify that they are tax compliant and that their property is in such a lettable condition that it meets the statutory requirements for rented accommodation as part of the HAP application process.  Landlords are also informed and agree that the data they have supplied on the HAP Application Form will be shared with other public bodies, including the Revenue Commissioners, for the purpose of the prevention or detection of fraud.</p>  <p>  The HAP SSC also manages the tax compliance element of the scheme on behalf of the relevant local authorities.  Accordingly, the HAP SSC must follow the tax compliance requirements set down in the provisions of the scheme and the general tax requirements of all public bodies as provided for under the Taxes Consolidation Acts.</p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for the HAP scheme and contains the statutory provisions for the payment of HAP to a landlord by a housing authority for the rent of qualifying households.  Section 39 provides for the payment of housing assistance in respect of qualified households and sets out the principal features of the scheme, including that the landlord must comply with the conditions set out in section 42, including demonstrating tax compliance.</p>  <p>  Under section 42(2) of the 2014 Act the landlord must be tax compliant.  It is therefore a statutory requirement that a landlord must give a PPSN number or tax reference and a current tax clearance certificate or evidence of tax compliance.  In this regard, individuals receiving rental income, including HAP payments, should contact Revenue to ensure that they are tax compliant and/ or to apply for tax clearance.</p>  <p>  Separate requirements are provided for under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as amended, which requires that no payments may be made by a public body, including a local authority, totalling &euro;10,000 or more in a 12 month period to an individual, company or other body without providing evidence of current tax compliance.</p>  <p>  While the HAP SSC will continue to seek evidence of tax compliance from a landlord, they may continue to pay them after the 5 months threshold has been reached; however, they cannot pay them after the &euro;10,000 threshold has been reached.  The HAP SSC works with landlords on a daily basis to assist them in meeting their requirements under the scheme, including in relation to tax compliance, and it does not constitute a difficulty in the management of the scheme.</p></reply>

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated. Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave. This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  Further information on pyrite and the scheme are available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie.</i></p><p>The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie.</p></reply>

My Department will be engaging  with both these Departments to request that they consider the issues raised and provide material for inclusion in the report to Government on Storm Ophelia which is currently being prepared.</p>  <p>  In view of the Red Level weather warning, on 13 October 2017, my Department, through its National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management activated its procedures for responding to a severe weather event.</p>  <p>  On the morning of 15 October 2017 a decision was taken to close Departmental offices located in counties for which Red Level weather warnings applied at that time.  That evening, in light of updated weather warnings received from Met &Eacute;ireann, my Department decided that its Headquarters at the Custom House would be substantially closed on 16 October. All contactable Dublin based staff were subsequently informed that, while the building would be open, only essential personnel would be required to attend.</p>  <p>  The response to Storm Ophelia is currently being reviewed.  A report is being prepared which will be submitted to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning for its attention before being submitted for the consideration of Government in January 2018.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of 62% on the capital side to build new social homes and 35% on the current side to support homelessness, as well as supporting households into new social housing tenancies.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2018, I have secured an extra &euro;500 million for capital investment in social housing in the years 2019 to 2021, allowing the Rebuilding Ireland social housing target to be increased from 47,000 to 50,000 homes.</p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan, we have set clear, measurable and ambitious targets to, among other things, double the annual level of new homes to 25,000 by 2020; deliver an additional 50,000 social housing units in the period to 2021; and meet the housing needs of some 87,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment.</p>  <p>  We are already seeing some encouraging trends and outcomes from this increased investment and focus.  Over 19,000 new social housing solutions were provided in 2016, with a further 21,000 such supports to be delivered in 2017.  Planning permissions and construction site commencements are both showing significant growth on 2016 trends, signalling that increased supply is coming on stream.</p>  <p>  While house prices are continuing to rise, reflecting the ongoing imbalance between supply and demand, particularly in Dublin and the other urban areas where pressure is greatest, there has been some moderation in rent inflation, following the introduction of rent pressure zones earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this wide-ranging platform of action, significant challenges remain and, one year on from Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s publication, I initiated a focused review of the Action Plan.  A number of themed initiatives have already been announced as part of the review, including new and enhanced commitments in relation to social housing and homelessness, an enhanced regulatory role for the Residential Tenancies Board as well as additional legislative and other measures to strengthen the protections available to tenants and landlords to ensure a sustainable rental sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to housing affordability, as I have previously signalled, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country, and as such housing affordability has been examined across a range of interconnected policy areas in the context of the ongoing focused review of Rebuilding Ireland.  This work will build on measures already in place to enable the provision of affordable homes, to buy or rent, including planning reforms, such as the fast-track planning approval process for large developments of scale; reduced and reformed development contributions; rent caps in specific Rent Pressure Zones; and further amendments to apartment planning guidelines to allow for more cost-effective and affordable apartment development for our city centres.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 has made provision for new funding of &euro;25 million, to be provided over 2018 and 2019, aimed at unlocking local authority owned land specifically in order to deliver affordable housing on those sites.  My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this scheme, to be announced in the coming weeks, along with further affordability measures.</p>  <p>  I believe that this Government's commitment to tackling housing has been clearly demonstrated in terms of the delivery on Rebuilding Ireland and the resources that have been allocated.  My focus and that of all delivery agents will remain firmly on implementation and delivery to maintain and accelerate social housing delivery and wider housing output.</p></reply>

These schemes provide social housing support for households already living in the private rental sector and for households who require long-term assistance with their housing needs, by allowing them to increase their income without the risk of losing their housing support.  Under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment, therefore putting their housing security at risk.  On average, 346 new households are supported by HAP each week, and the Rebuilding Ireland 2017 target of supporting 15,000 additional households with the scheme has already been exceeded.</p><p>The following table sets out the new households supported by HAP and RAS in 2017 based on the most recent data available.  It also sets out the households supported by HAP each week on average in 2017.  The equivalent HAP numbers for the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE), which operates the Homeless HAP scheme across all Dublin local authority areas including Dublin City and Fingal, are also provided.</p><p><table><tr><th>Authority </th><th>RAS@ 30/9/17</th><th>HAP @ 13/11/17</th><th>HAP Weekly rate @ 13/11/17 </th></tr><tr><td>Authority </td><td>RAS@ 30/9/17</td><td>HAP @ 13/11/17</td><td>Average newly supported tenancies per week @ 13/11/17</td></tr><tr><td>DCC </td><td>43</td><td>841*</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>51</td><td>376*</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>DRHE </td><td>n/a</td><td>1506</td><td>33</td></tr></table></p><p>*HAP became operational in DCC and Fingal on 1 March 2017.</p><p>Budget 2018 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149m to &euro;301 million in order to meet the continuing costs of existing households and the costs of meeting the additional 17,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2018.  The 2018 targets have been carefully projected and acknowledge the length of time the scheme has been established in each local authority, as well as the transfer of an increasing number of households from rent supplement to HAP. Current data indicates that around one third of new households receiving HAP for the first time have transferred from rent supplement.  Overall, I expect this proportion to increase incrementally throughout 2018 and my Department will be working closely with local authorities and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure that this target is met.  This will facilitate a greater number of households who are currently living in private rented accommodation to receive more secure support in meeting their housing costs,  and also allow them to increase their income without the risk of losing that support.</p><p>In 2018, funding of &euro;134 million has been provided in order to support a further 600 new transfers under RAS and also to meet the ongoing cost of 19,900 households supported under the scheme.  RAS remains an important social housing delivery mechanism; however the anticipated decreasing number of annual transfers from rent supplement to RAS is indicative of the increasing number of transfers from rent supplement to HAP.</p><p>I am satisfied with the operation and resourcing of HAP and RAS, and I am confident that the targets set under Rebuilding Ireland will be met.</p></reply>

This Section places a statutory duty on organisers of funfairs and owners of fairground equipment to take such care as is reasonable for ensuring that persons at a funfair do not suffer injury or damage by reason of dangers arising from the funfair or associated activities. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of Section 239 of the Act, "funfair&rdquo; means an entertainment where fairground equipment is used, while &lsquo;&lsquo;fairground equipment&rsquo;&rsquo; includes any fairground ride or any similar equipment which is designed to be in motion for entertainment purposes with members of the public on or inside it, any equipment which is designed to be used by members of the public for entertainment purposes either as a slide or for bouncing upon, and any swings, dodgems and other equipment which is designed to be in motion wholly or partly under the control of, or to be put in motion by, a member of the public or any equipment which may be prescribed, in the interests of public safety.

Over the years 2004 to 2009, this included support for local authorities to carry out an extensive central heating upgrade programme in social housing, which saw the installation of central heating, and associated energy efficiency measures, in 27,750 such dwellings, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;140 million. My Department is not currently operating any programme to install heating systems in existing social houses.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social homes. Funding of some &euro;107 million has been provided from 2013 to end-2016 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in some 58,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020.</p>  <p>  The insulation retrofitting programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties while Phase 2 of the programme, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils,  will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction. Heating upgrades will be considered in future phases of the Programme. In the meanwhile, if a local authority identifies a tenanted dwelling which requires a specific and urgent energy efficiency upgrade, especially in those dwellings which accommodate elderly people and people with disabilities, then a special case should be made to my Department to have these works funded. </p></reply>

I have no doubt that my predecessors in various Governments over the years share that appreciation and depth of gratitude.  There are currently two medals that mark the service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force. The medal known as An Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se (The Service Medal) may be awarded to an officer, non-commissioned officer or private of the Defence Forces, or a member of the Army Nursing or Chaplaincy Service who possess the qualifying criteria for the award. The qualifying service for officers and members of the Chaplaincy Service and Army Nursing Service is 5,475 days satisfactory and continuous service. The qualifying service for NCOs and Privates is 3,650 days satisfactory and continuous service.   </p>  <p>  An Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se (Na h&Oacute;glaigh C&uacute;ltaca) (The Service Medal (Reserve Defence Force)) was introduced in 1961 for members and former members of the Reserve and is awarded after 7 years service.   </p>  <p>  The award of either of these medals to qualifying personnel reflects the service given by those personnel to either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force as the case may be, and by extension the wider public, during the periods for which they served.   </p>  <p>  Whilst acknowledging the significant role of all Defence Forces personnel to the security of the State throughout the period of the &lsquo;Troubles&rsquo;, I am satisfied that these medals meet the need of marking service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or Reserve Defence Force as the case may be, and I have no plans to introduce additional medals in this regard.</p></reply>
