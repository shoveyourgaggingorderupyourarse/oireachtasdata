The unified identity makes it easier for citizens to understand and recognise when the Government is communicating with them and when projects and initiatives are funded by the Government.</p>  <p>  The experience of Governments internationally, and the research done in other jurisdictions, notably in the Netherlands, confirms the confusion and lack of clarity resulting from this fragmented approach. </p>  <p>  The Dutch experience, and that of the UK and others, is that a unified, consistent identifiable identity ensures greater clarity around the role and place of Government in society for citizens and in Government communications.</p>  <p>  All Government Departments have been supplied with the logos, templates and guidelines necessary to apply the identity and this application is well underway in all Government Departments. This is evident in the use of the Government of Ireland identity at Government events, media/press conferences and at public events, conferences etc where Government Departments have a presence. </p>  <p>  The unified identity has also been applied at Departmental level - from Departmental logos through to a consistent approach to the design of communications campaigns, reports, online activity and identifying all Government communications campaigns as being an initiative of the Government of Ireland. </p>  <p>  An example of how this unified identity provides a clear, identifiable presence for the citizen was at the recent National Ploughing Championships, where the Government representation was immediately and clearly identifiable, as a result of each Department using the unified identity in the design of their units.</p></reply>

Decisions on how and where those allocations are invested by Departments are a matter, in the first instance, for my ministerial colleagues. </p>  <p>  The ten-year National Development Plan (NDP) has been put in place to underpin the implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and to support the development of all counties and regions, both urban and rural areas, including County Donegal.</p>  <p>  Total funding of &euro;8.8 billion is allocated to the Strategic Outcome of strengthened rural economies and communities which is a cornerstone of the NDP, including in relation to the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and significant investment in regional and local roads.  The NDP also contains, as a priority, increased investment in public transport and ongoing investment in the Local Link Programme.  </p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, the NDP represents a particular step change for the northern part of the island of Ireland, including Donegal and the North-West. For example, the NDP provides for investment to support the ambition for development of the region such as the N2/A5 road serving Meath, Monaghan and Donegal. </p>  <p>  A major capital projects tracker is available on the website of my Department, which sets out details of the key projects being implemented under the Plan, including the location of the projects where possible.  Some of the major projects directly related to Donegal include:</p>  <p>  - The N56 Mountcharles to Inver Road (&euro;39 million) due for completion in 2019</p>  <p>  - N56 Dungloe to Glenties (&euro;100 million) due for completion in 2019</p>  <p>  - Investment in Donegal Airport as part of the Regional Airports Programme</p>  <p>  - Letterkenny hospital rebuild including Radiology</p>  <p>  Under the NPF, the three Regional Assemblies are now responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of the NPF, through the preparation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The strategy for the Northern and Western Region provides the opportunity for the priorities for Donegal, for example the priorities included in the existing County Development Plan, to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-24a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400072#WRA02900"><p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the &euro;400m of proceeds from the sale of Bord Gais Energy that the Government announced, in Budget 2015, would be made available to support the Government's Social Housing Strategy.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the intention when Bord Gais Energy was sold was that &euro;400m from the proceeds would be made available to establish an off-balance sheet financial vehicle to provide financing to Approved Housing Bodies.  This funding, together with additional private funding, would then facilitate the provision of additional housing units by the AHB sector, in support of the Government's Social Housing Strategy.  </p>  <p>  The Government established a Clearing House Group, under the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, to work with the sector with a view to developing a new model that could use the &euro;400m in this way.  Unfortunately, however, it proved very challenging to find a model that would be capable of using the funding while remaining off-balance sheet in Eurostat terms.  </p>  <p>  However, the Clearing House Group considered that there were aspects of some of the proposals considered that appeared to offer potential, in terms of the possible development of a new &lsquo;affordable rental&rsquo; initiative.  This would seek to provide long-term affordable residential accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand. </p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided to convert the commitment from a single lump sum payment to fund the initial capital cost of social housing provision, into a commitment to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a much longer period &ndash; at least 20 years.  This ongoing funding could then be used to fund a pilot scheme for the provision of subsidised housing, thus making the housing available on an affordable basis over a 20 year period.  </p>  <p>  This additional &euro;10 million in annual funding was allocated to the Vote of the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government from 2017 onwards.  In addition, this commitment to increased funding for social and affordable housing has been subsumed into a much more significant commitment to increased support for the programmes of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the area of housing - as reflected both in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 published in February 2018 and also the further &euro;266 million in additional capital funding allocated for this purpose over 2019-2021 in Budget 2019. </p></reply>

Once vegetation is cleared, it is anticipated that bank repairs will be necessary where slippages are evident. Repairs will be undertaken as required.</p>  <p>  - Any fallen trees and potential debris blockages have been removed when observed or upon receipt of notification of same.</p>  <p>  - Cleaning of a number of feeder drains/streams to the Owenass and Barrow have taken place with further works planned throughout this month.</p>  <p>  I recognise the critical importance of drainage maintenance to flood risk management and I have written to the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government on the current funding constraints some Councils have highlighted to meet their statutory maintenance obligations. On an exceptional and once-off basis I have made available &euro;50,000 to Laois County Council towards its overall costs for the drainage maintenance in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) study carried out by the Office of Public Works resulted in the publication of the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP&rsquo;s). These FRMP&rsquo;s identified a viable solution for the flooding problem in the town of Mountmellick, and the cost of implementing this plan is estimated at &euro;4.7 million. As such, the Office of Public Works has allowed for this funding in its capital works budget. </p>  <p>  A steering group has been established for the progression of the Mountmellick project, and is made up of representatives from Laois County Council and the Office of Public Works. This steering group has been working together over the last number of months to collect the relevant data in order to compose a detailed brief for the procurement of engineering consultants, and it is hoped that this contract will be advertised by the end of the year. Once the consultants are procured, they will use the data collected throughout the CFRAM study, and the local data collected by the steering group, to assess further the solution identified in the FRMP&rsquo;s. The cost of implementing flood defences for the town will be reviewed in the light of this further analysis. However, we are confident that the solution will remain cost beneficial. </p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) has a long-standing working relationship with the Department of Infrastructure, Rivers (Dfl Rivers) which is the competent authority for the implementation of the &lsquo;EU Floods Directive&rsquo; in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the OPW and Dfl Rivers agreed to establish a Cross-Border Co-ordination Group to co-ordinate the implementation of the &lsquo;EU Floods Directive&rsquo; across the border. This work was supported by a Cross-Border Technical Co-ordination Group. These groups have met on a number of occasions to co-ordinate their respective work to screen and assess the flood risk and to prepare plans to manage flood risk in border areas.</p>  <p>  The Erne Catchment was assessed under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme, in close co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure, Northern Ireland. The study considered increasing watercourse conveyance of the Erne system to lower water levels as a measure to reduce flood risk.  This study revealed that water levels in the majority of the Erne catchment in Ireland, remain unchanged regardless of any works that could be carried out in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However parts of the Erne Catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.</p></reply>

Insolvency statistics published for Q1 2018 indicate the construction industry recorded 42 insolvencies (22% of the total number of insolvencies), a 17% increase on Q1 2017.  Published analysis points to legacy issues related to the property crash rather than the public works contracts as the cause of these insolvencies. </p>  <p>  The total capital expenditure channeled through the public works contracts accounts for approximately 20% of the total value of construction output (industry estimates put this at &euro;19.5 billion for 2018).  Whilst it is accepted that a number of the insolvencies that have arisen involve companies who were operating under public works contracts, those same companies would also have been operating under a range of the other forms of construction contract widely used by private sector construction clients.</p>  <p>  Analysis undertaken in the UK in the wake of the collapse of Carillion has highlighted the low margins (between 1 &ndash; 2%) generally made by main contractors in a sector that is traditionally seen as high risk.  Given the cultural similarities between the UK and Irish construction industries there is every reason to believe low margins are also prevalent in the Irish construction sector.  This culture must be addressed by the industry if it is to service its client base in a professional manner.</p>  <p>  The impact of awarding contracts at low prices was highlighted in the Report on the Review of the Performance of the Public Works Contracts published in 2014.  A range of measures was recommended in that report to discourage unsustainably low pricing, amongst other aspects.  Most of these measures have been implemented since 2016 and are designed to give contracting authorities much greater detail on the price make-up.</p>  <p>  A further measure identified in the Report is the development of a medium term strategy for the procurement of public works projects.  Engagement with industry stakeholder bodies has recently commenced on that strategy which will outline the optimum means of procuring the necessary expertise to deliver public works projects in a sustainable, efficient and cost effective manner.</p></reply>

These public servants generally have a compulsory retirement age of 65 at present, which is provided for under statute.  The Bill passed all stages in the Seanad on 17 July and is provisionally scheduled for Second Stage in the Dail on the 25th of this month.  The Bill is being treated as a priority with the intention of securing enactment as soon as possible in the current term.</p>  <p>  Interim arrangements are in place to accommodate public servants who reach the age of 65 before the commencement of the Bill.   The interim arrangements, which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65, allow pre 2004 public servants to retire and be rehired for one year only, until they reach the age of 66.  Existing retire and rehire arrangements operating in the various sectors are being used to facilitate affected public servants.    </p>  <p>  On the issue of  whether the legislation will be backdated to the date of publication of the Bill, I appreciate that there are individual public servants who have availed of the interim arrangements, whereby they have been facilitated to remain at work between the age of 65 and 66, and who would like to be covered by the new legislation.  Unfortunately, this is not something that can be facilitated.  The legislation will come into effect from the date of its commencement.  Until then, the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65 must be respected.  This requires public servants to retire at the age of 65 and those availing of the interim arrangements have done so and received their pension benefits, subject to pension abatement.      </p>  <p>  On that basis they are in a different position to those existing public servants who reach the age of 65 after this legislation has commenced. If the interim arrangements had not existed, those availing of the interim arrangements would have had to cease working at age 65.  </p>  <p>  The general policy across the public service, subject to overall policy considerations including the demand for scarce skills etc., is that where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired.  This practice is continuing in the context of the interim arrangements.   In most cases, the combination of the pension in payment and the new salary brings the person back up to the income level they had reached before they retired. However, after the date of commencement of the Bill, the interim arrangements will no longer be required as public servants reaching the age of 65 will be able to remain at work up to the age of 70, if they so wish, on current terms and conditions. Incremental progression will continue up to the date of retirement and additional service will count towards pension accrual subject to the statutory maximum of 40 years. </p>  <p>  In terms of the numbers of public servants who have availed of the interim arrangements, I would not have access to numbers for the individual public service sectors.  In the Civil Service, for which I have responsibility, I am aware that fewer than 100 people availed of retention in the six months after the arrangements were announced. </p></reply>

In these circumstances, a public servant may qualify, subject to certain eligibility conditions, for a supplementary pension to make up the difference between the amount of the occupational pension to which they are entitled and the amount they would have received if their occupational pension was not integrated.</p>  <p>  A public service pensioner may only qualify for a supplementary pension if they are not engaged in paid employment, do not qualify for social insurance benefit or fail to qualify for such benefit at less than the maximum rate, and their failure to qualify is due to causes outside their control.</p>  <p>  The Single Public Service Pension Scheme (Single Scheme), which was introduced on 1 January 2013 under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012, applies to all first-time new entrants to the public service from that date and represented a key reform initiative aimed at securing the provision of affordable occupational pensions into the long term future in the public service.</p>  <p>  The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to the superannuation arrangements of all public servants recruited before 1 January 2013 &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.</p>  <p>  However, unlike the pre-existing public service pension schemes, the minimum pension age for the majority of Single Scheme members is aligned to the Contributory State Pension qualifying age and is currently set at age 66, rising to age 67 in 2021 and age 68 in 2028 while the maximum pension age  upon which a Scheme member must retire is 70.  I have no plans to review the provisions currently provided for under the Single Scheme.</p>  <p>  By way of further information, the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018, which was published on 9 July, provides for an increase in the compulsory retirement age to 70, for the majority of public servants recruited prior to 1 April 2004.

The Construction Contracts Act was first introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and enacted with Government Support in 2013.Commenced by Statutory Instrument in July 2016, it applies to all construction contracts (as defined in the Act), public or private sector, whether they are written or oral and whether they include payment provisions or not. The Act imposes minimum payment requirements and provides the necessary tools to enforce those payments between the main contractor and their sub-contractors and so on down the supply chain.</p><p>The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) was comprehensively updated to reflect the provisions of the Construction Contracts Act 2013 in June 2016.  The CWMF includes a suite of template tender documents and contracts which public bodies must use when procuring contractors on public works projects.</p><p>The Act provides important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry and includes:</p><p>- a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for sub-contractors;</p><p>- a right to suspension for non-payment; </p><p>- a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication; and</p><p>- the prohibition of arrangements that make entitlement to payment conditional on certain  events, (e.g. &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; clauses, which delay payments until the payer has, in turn, been paid), which were prevalent in most forms of sub-contract.</p><p>Whilst much of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that appears to be largely ignored.  Arguably these are the most important provisions in the Act but sub-contractors must be proactive in enforcing their entitlements with the contractor for payments that are due.</p><p>The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation/receivership and so where this arises the only route for recovery is through the normal insolvency process.  However the magnitude of the exposure that many sub-contractors currently face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise if the provision for payments were insisted upon <i>and</i>the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming.</p><p>Responsibility for administration of the Act lies with my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D.</p></reply>

A key responsibility of each Minister and Department is delivering public services efficiently and effectively within their budgetary allocations. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed in line with not only Departmental allocations but also within the overall fiscal parameters. Each month, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on against published expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  However, given the scale of Government expenditure, &euro;61.8 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018,  and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends. </p>  <p>  As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, as a result of policy decisions, including in relation to the provision of a 100 per cent Christmas Bonus to social welfare recipients and additional capital for the Department of Housing, and expenditure pressures in particular in the Health sector, the gross voted expenditure outturn for the year is now estimated at &euro;62.8 billion, an increase of &euro;1 billion relative to the gross voted expenditure amount in REV 2018.</p>  <p>  Looking at the overall fiscal parameters, the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2018, set out a General Government deficit of 0.2 per cent of GDP, or &euro;780 million, for 2018. As outlined in Budget 2019, this General Government deficit target is now projected to be over-achieved, with the forecast General Government deficit for this year being 0.1 per cent of GDP, or &euro;315 million, after taking account of the additional voted expenditure of &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  Given this overall fiscal context, the Government has agreed an increase in the expenditure ceiling for the year, and Supplementary Estimates will be presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in this regard.</p>  <p>  A key element of the increase in gross voted expenditure is an expenditure overrun in Health of &euro;645 million, with an additional &euro;55 million being required for a shortfall in receipts.  As I outlined in my statement to the D&aacute;il on Budget day, I continue to look at choices that we have to make in healthcare regarding how we can accompany all time high levels of investment with improved governance, accountability, effectiveness and value for money.</p></reply>

Provision for the additional cost has been provided for in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  In general, the agreement provides for two separate interventions which will take place at point 4 and point 8 of pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed thereby reducing the time spent (by bypassing two increment points) on the scale for progression to the maximum point. The average individual benefit arising across all sectors is approximately &euro;3,300 which is in addition to the pay benefits provided for under the Agreement and legislation of 7.4% to 6.2% (up to 10% for new entrants post 2012) which were already weighted in favour of new entrants and the lower paid.  </p>  <p>  The benefits under the measure will be effective from 1 March 2019 and will, in accordance with Paragraph 4.1.3 of the Agreement itself, be restricted to Parties adhering to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2017-2020 (PSSA) precludes industrial action, cost increasing claims and claims relating to pay. </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 (PSPP Act) distinguishes between &lsquo;covered&rsquo; and &lsquo;non-covered&rsquo; public servants. If a Union ceases to abide by the terms of the PSSA, public servants who are members of that Union will become non-covered public servants. </p>  <p>  Non-covered public servants are subject to a 9 month delay in each pay restoration/increase; freezing of incremental progression until end 2020; a less favourable regime in relation to additional pension contributions and are excluded from benefits arising from the Reports of the Public Service Pay Commission or measures relating to New Entrants.</p></reply>

Because of this, Departments are permitted to carry over unspent capital up to a maximum of 10 per cent of their Voted capital allocation from the current year into the next financial year.  Statutory provision for capital carryover by way of "deferred surrender" to the Exchequer was made in Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004.</p>  <p>  The Act requires that capital carryover sums be specified by Vote in the Appropriation Act for the year from which moneys are carried.  </p>  <p>  To allow spending of the capital carryover amounts, I am required as Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to make an Order no later than 31 March of that year determining the capital carryover amounts by subhead which will be available for expenditure on those subheads consistent with the amounts by Vote included in the Appropriation Act.  D&aacute;il approval of the draft Ministerial Order is required before I can make the Order.  Once the order is made, the carryover amounts become a first charge against the subheads concerned.  If the carryover sums are not spent in the next financial year, they must be surrendered to the Central Fund.  </p></reply>

The current INTERREG Programme has a total value of &euro;282 million and is aimed at promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion.  The current PEACE Programme has a total value of &euro;270 million and aims to promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ever since the UK referendum on EU membership the Government&rsquo;s clear and consistent position has been that it is committed to the successful implementation of the current programmes and to successor arrangements post-2020.  My officials and I have been working with the European Commission at all levels to ensure that this important source of funding for the border region continues post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  I am pleased, therefore, that the Government&rsquo;s ambition for the programmes was reflected in last December&rsquo;s EU-UK Joint Report on Brexit in which both parties undertook to honour their commitments to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes under the current Multiannual Financial Framework and to examine the possibilities for future support favourably.  This was matched by a commitment from the Commission to propose the continuation of the programmes in its proposal for the next MFF covering the period 2021-2027.   </p>  <p>  This has now happened, and I warmly welcome the Commission&rsquo;s recent proposal for a special new PEACE PLUS programme which will build on and continue the work of successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  My officials and I are continuing to work with the Commission on the development of this new programme to ensure that the challenges facing the border region are addressed. </p></reply>

An environmental survey was carried out to establish the status of the population and the likely impact of any works. </p>  <p>  Given the impact the proposed works could have on the Fresh Water Pearl Mussel population, a proposal to translocate Fresh Water Pearl Mussel from the River Sullane and re-introduce them post works was submitted to the NPWS and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht .</p>  <p>  The submission was approved, allowing the scheme preparations to progress to site investigation, which will inform the preferred options for the scheme.

As outlined in Budget 2019, this General Government deficit target is now projected to be over-achieved, with the forecast General Government deficit for this year being 0.1 per cent of GDP or &euro;315 million.</p>  <p>  As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, as a result of policy decisions, including in relation to the provision of a 100 per cent Christmas Bonus to social welfare recipients and additional capital funding for the Department of Housing, and expenditure pressures in particular in the Health sector, the gross voted expenditure outturn for the year is now estimated at &euro;62.8 billion, an increase of &euro;1 billion relative to the gross voted expenditure amount in the SES.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Expenditure Report 2019, at the end of September PRSI receipts were over &euro;150 million ahead of profile, and it is currently projected that PRSI receipts will finish the year c. &euro;250 million higher than projected in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018. In addition, other Departmental receipts, or appropriations-in-aid, are anticipated to finish the year c. &euro;0.2 billion ahead of profile. It is because of this additional revenue, along with higher than anticipated Exchequer tax receipts, higher-than-projected non tax revenues, and lower non-voted current expenditure, that the increase in gross voted expenditure can be accommodated, while at the same time seeing an improvement in the General Government deficit.</p></reply>

All were in agreement that an investigation into the case is the priority now.  Since then Saudi Arabia has confirmed that Mr Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul. We heard further shocking details from the Turkish President yesterday, however we still do not have all the facts of the case. High Representative Federica Mogherini has issued a statement on behalf of the European Union insisting on the need for a thorough, credible and transparent investigation, shedding proper clarity on the circumstances of the killing and ensuring full accountability of all those responsible for it.  Ireland supports calls for the completion of this investigation. I would also like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Khashoggi&rsquo;s family. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned in the D&aacute;il last week, I met with the Saudi Ambassador, H.E. Mr Nail bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, on 18 October and stressed the widespread shock caused by the case and the necessity for a credible and open investigation. It is imperative that the ongoing investigation gets to the facts of the case and ensures that those responsible for the killing are held accountable. </p>  <p>  While there are clearly very serious questions to answer, we must allow the investigation to proceed now, and await its outcome. Once the investigation is complete we can consider next steps. Our approach will be in tandem with our EU partners and these will depend on the next steps taken by Saudi authorities.</p>  <p>  Freedom of expression is a fundamental right under international human rights law. Journalists play a vital role in holding governments to account. Ireland has consistently raised issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia, at bilateral, EU and international level. Ireland makes its position known through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Riyadh, through the Saudi Embassy in Dublin, and in cooperation with the EU delegation in Riyadh and other EU Member States. Ireland will continue to raise concerns about human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever appropriate opportunities arise. </p></reply>

The absence of the Executive also means that that North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.

It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit. </p><p>The Government is therefore firmly focused on protecting the full range of areas in which North South cooperation exists today in the context of the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the UK, and in doing so works closely with the Commission Taskforce.  This includes our involvement in discussions, where appropriate, while respecting the negotiations structures that have been mandated by the European Council.  </p><p>At the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, officials carried out detailed work over October and November 2017 to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies. </p><p>This included looking at the six North South implementation bodies, the areas of cooperation under the North South Ministerial Council, which cover agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism; as well as other areas where there is practical cooperation between North and South, including justice and security, energy, broadcasting and communications, inland fisheries, sport and culture.</p><p>It has been made public that an initial listing established over 140 areas of North-South cooperation within this framework.  This number was identified in the early stages of the process and was not prepared by the Irish Government.  The listing provided a basis for further discussions in the course of the dialogue. </p><p>The exercise overall highlighted how the maintenance and future development of meaningful North South cooperation relies on the EU legal and policy frameworks to give direction to th<font color="#004080">is</font>cooperation and to facilitate its operation.  The EU frameworks are both overarching and the foundation to North South cooperation in many instances.  Much of the cooperation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary; it is not easily quantifiable.</p><p>The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December 2017 acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.  This is further reflected in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including in Article 8, the text of which has been marked green, meaning that it is agreed at negotiator level. </p><p>As the mapping exercise was conducted by the EU and UK in the course of their dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland, joint publication of a final report is ultimately a matter for the EU and UK. </p></reply>

We are fully committed to developing and enhancing this relationship over the coming years<font color="#004080"> </font>and to working together as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement to support the totality of relationships across these islands.  Additionally, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the European Union.The Taoiseach and I have extensively engaged on behalf of the Government with our counterparts in the British government in support of the full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement.In addition, the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference met on 25 July to discuss issues of mutual interest to the Irish and British Governments, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, with the Irish Government represented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Charles Flanagan TD and myself, acting as co-chair.  The Conference discussed legacy issues, security co-operation, East-West bilateral issues, and political stability in Northern Ireland.  Preparations for the next meeting of the Conference are actively underway.</p><p>At the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference and in my ongoing engagement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I of course strongly emphasise the centrality of North South Cooperation and the North South Ministerial Council to the Good Friday Agreement, and the imperative for both Governments as co-guarantors, to continue to work together to support the effective operation of the interlocking institutions of the Agreement. </p><p>At present, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive, it is not possible for the NSMC to meet and to bring the Government and Executive together to oversee ongoing North South work and further develop cooperation.  Notwithstanding the current political situation, the North South Implementation Bodies continue to carry out their important public functions in line with their mandates and to deliver economic and social benefits for people across the island. </p><p>The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December 2017 acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the European Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.</p><p>In respect of East-West cooperation, the Government also actively engages in the work of the British Irish Council (BIC), as the institution of the Agreement to promote the mutually beneficial development of relationships between the two sovereign Governments, the devolved Administrations and the other Administrations of the Council. </p><p>In addition to cooperation and engagement within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, Government Ministers also continue to meet with their British Government counterparts to support and advance bilateral cooperation between Ireland and the UK, across all relevant sectors and policy areas.  In recent weeks, I have met with my counterpart, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt MP, and the Secretary to the Cabinet Office David Lidington, where we have had good discussions on the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the UK. </p></reply>

The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in Washington, D.C., provides an excellent opportunity for such substantive engagement, and I can confirm that the Taoiseach met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in March, along with very many other US elected representatives.  I hope to travel to Washington, D.C., after the mid-term elections, for a series of political and other engagements.  The Embassy of Ireland in Washington, D.C., will prepare my programme for that visit and I would very much welcome the opportunity to meet with the US Senate Majority Leader at that time, as well as other key Congressional representatives.   </p></reply>

While I met with a number of my counterparts during the United Nations General Assembly in September, I did not meet with Foreign Minister Sisulu, as a meeting between Ireland and South Africa was held at Head of State or Government level between the Taoiseach and President Ramaphosa.</p>  <p>In October last year, I travelled to Pretoria to co-chair the 5th Session of the South Africa-Ireland Partnership Forum, along with Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Luwellyn Landers. The forum is a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the close relationship and ties between South Africa and Ireland, offering the chance to also look towards future cooperation in areas such as agriculture, education, the energy sector, trade and investment and multilateralism.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department engage regularly with South Africa, primarily through the Irish Embassy in Pretoria, and with the Embassy of South Africa in Dublin.  The South Africa-Ireland Partnership Forum is a valuable part of that regular engagement, with officials from Ireland and South Africa scheduled to meet in that format next month for a mid-term review of the partnership.

In addition, they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. </p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service to assist the public with any queries or complaints they may have in relation to insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914. </p></reply>

The staffing costs of these three units on a full year basis in 2017 was &euro;2.4m. </p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following appraisal of risk factors which can be an indicator of potential tax avoidance and/or tax evasion in a case.  The yield from the compliance interventions completed by the relevant units in Revenue&rsquo;s LCD are set out in the table.  <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Yield &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>4.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>17.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>43.6m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>17.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>15.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2018 year to date</td><td>8m</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>106.2m</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the yield from compliance interventions LCD, as part of its compliance work, makes recommendations for legislative amendments. Where such recommendations are subsequently enacted they may result in further savings for the Exchequer.  </p><p>Tax administrations generally use assets and/or wealth as their main criteria for determining a HWI, while some administrations also include income.  In general, I am advised that Revenue&rsquo;s criteria for identifying HWIs is individuals with net assets of over &euro;50m. There is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of their net worth on returns of income. Accordingly, Revenue does not have the data required to estimate the number of individuals with assets of more than &euro;10 million nor the related costs or staffing required for this extended case base.</p><p>The answers to Parliamentary Questions 175 and 176 set out that the staffing element of the original Large Cases Division which was focused on HWIs, avoidance, pensions and the related administration work. The total staffing was 64 whole time equivalents.  This is the staffing that has moved to the new Large Cases High Wealth Individuals Division. Currently approximately 25 of the 64 staff have responsibility for the tax affairs of HWIs.  </p><p>In relation to Question 44037/18, as also previously advised to the Deputy in my reply to Questions 175 and 176, Revenue has established a national Medium Enterprise Division as part of its structural realignment process.</p><p>The new Division which will have a staffing resource of approximately 380 by the end of 2018 has been mandated to manage the tax affairs of corporates and high wealth individuals that fall below the criteria for specific management in Large Cases Division.</p><p>The new Division will monitor the tax affairs of its case-base through various risk assessment programmes that are supported by data analytics, interrogation of both taxpayer and third-party information and examination of specific wealth indicators.</p><p>The nature and extent of all interventions carried out by the Medium Enterprise Division will be determined by the level of risk identified and the behaviour of the taxpayer involved but can typically range from more general aspect query type enquiries up to tax audit and investigation with a view to prosecution for the more egregious cases. </p></reply>

The Act, inter alia, provides for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party personal injury motor insurance claimants including the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim. </p>  <p>  The Act also provides for revised arrangements for the on-going administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund, including for the relevant applications to the President of the High Court.

The governing legislation in this regard is contained in the Finance Act 1975. Where a gaming machine is available for play, without a proper licence displayed, it is liable to forfeiture in accordance with Section 43(10)(b) of that Act.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that it has started a national compliance project on the gaming and amusement machine sector, which is designed to identify and tackle any non-compliance with tax and excise licensing obligations. This project is ongoing across all geographic regions and to date site visits have been carried out by Revenue officials to 250 separate premises. A range of follow-up actions are now being pursued with respect to the tax and licensing issues identified.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised me that prior to the start of this project it was necessary to obtain legal advice regarding the application of its enforcement powers in this sector. This issue arose on foot of a legal submission received from the industry. With the recent receipt of the required advices which clarified the position, Revenue is now proceeding with tackling any licensing issues identified using the full suite of powers available. Revenue has confirmed that while no seizures have taken place at this point, the process that must be adhered to in advance of any such action is now well under way.</p>  <p>  Regarding Question 44073/18, any queries regarding the legislation that governs gaming and gambling are a question for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, I can confirm that Revenue&rsquo;s increased focus on the gaming and amusement sector (since 2017) has resulted in a significant increase in voluntary compliance with the law.  For example, in 2016, 6,088 Gaming Machine licences were issued, generating total Excise revenue of &euro;1.8 million.  The equivalent figures for 2017 increased to 9,612 and &euro;2.7million respectively, while for 2018 year to date (30 September) 8,277 Gaming Machine licenses were issued generating Excise revenue of &euro;2.3 million. </p></reply>

Therefore, a company which is not treated as tax resident in Ireland, for whatever reason, cannot be a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110. </p>  <p>  The measures I understand the Deputy to be referring to were introduced in Finance Act 2014 to implement changes in tax residence rules for companies, and these changes are reflected in section 23A, TCA 1997.  These measures ensure that a company incorporated in the State is regarded as resident for tax purposes in the State, unless it is treated as resident in a treaty partner country by virtue of a double taxation treaty. </p>  <p>  This change in Ireland&rsquo;s company residence rules applies to companies incorporated on or after 1 January 2015.  For companies incorporated in the State before this date, the pre-Finance Act 2014 residence rules will continue to apply until the earlier of: </p>  <p>  (i) 31 December 2020 or</p>  <p>  (ii) The date, after 31 December 2014, of both a change in ownership of the company and a major change in the nature or conduct of the business of the company.</p>  <p>  This six year transitioning period was provided to give group companies that have real and substantial operations in Ireland a reasonable timeframe to plan and re-organise their business structures to take account of this change.</p>  <p>  The changes introduced in Finance Act 2014 do not prevent a foreign incorporated company that is centrally managed and controlled in the State being resident in the State for tax purposes. </p></reply>

However, given the scale of Government expenditure - &euro;61.8 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 - and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends. They are a budgetary tool that allows for the proper alignment of funding allocations with planned expenditure. Of course, they can only be allowed where they can be accommodated within the overall fiscal parameters.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-September 2018 was &euro;44,874 million, which is broadly on profile. Net voted expenditure of &euro;36,042 million was &euro;45 million below profile with net voted spending in 14 out of 17 Vote Groups being below profile. As outlined in the Fiscal Monitor, current spending is 0.6 per cent ahead of profile, with the main driver of this variance being Health expenditure. </p>  <p>  As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, as a result of policy decisions, including in relation to the provision of a 100 per cent Christmas Bonus to social welfare recipients, additional capital for the Department of Housing and expenditure pressures in particular in the Health sector, the gross voted expenditure outturn for the year is now estimated at &euro;62.8 billion, an increase of &euro;1 billion relative to the gross voted expenditure amount in REV 2018. A key element of the increase in gross voted expenditure is an expenditure overrun in Health of &euro;645 million, with an additional &euro;55 million being required for a shortfall in receipts.  As I outlined in my statement to the D&aacute;il on Budget day, I continue to look at choices that we have to make in healthcare regarding how we can accompany all time high levels of investment with improved governance, accountability, effectiveness and value for money.</p>  <p>  A number of measures are in place to support value for money in terms of capital and current expenditure.  During 2018, my Department has engaged with a range of Departments on year two of the Spending Review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. In the last two years of the Spending Review process, over 50 analytical papers have been produced.  These papers:</p>  <p>  -  Provide an evidence base in relation to Departmental spending that informs the choices made in relation to budgetary allocations;</p>  <p>  -  Identify areas of existing expenditure that require ongoing analysis where issues emerge during the Spending Review; and</p>  <p>  -  Outline key sectoral trends and provide analysis with international comparisons on expenditure levels and efficiency.</p>  <p>  Building on the output of the Spending Reviews in 2017 and 2018, the intention is that the Spending Review in 2019 will once again focus on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of specific spending programmes. The Spending Review in 2019 will continue to support the development of better policy options for Government by broadening and deepening the knowledge of a range of complex policy areas to facilitate future discussions regarding the evolution of Government expenditure.</p>  <p>  Turning to capital expenditure, the National Development Plan (NDP) has set an investment in infrastructure of almost &euro;116 billion over the ten year period to 2027. Such a level of investment requires a strong framework to drive its implementation and increased transparency on the projects and programmes being supported by this investment. In this regard, a high-level Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board has been established.  The Project Delivery Board will continue to provide strategic direction and leadership to the NDP and National Planning Framework (NPF) implementation process. The Delivery Board will monitor and oversee implementation structures and performance across the various sectors to ensure a co-ordinated and collaborative whole of Government approach to NDP and NPF delivery. </p>  <p>  In relation to public service reform, Our Public Service 2020 is the framework for reform and innovation in the public service which was launched in December 2017. This phase of public service reform focuses on supporting sustainable, continuous progress across the public service. It aims to build a stronger public service and to deliver better quality services to the Irish public. </p></reply>

Central to the Government&rsquo;s preparation for such challenges is the prudent management of the public finances in order to ensure the economy remains competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  Measures being taken include balancing the books, reducing our debt burden, building up the Rainy Day Fund and continuing to invest in infrastructure.</p>  <p>   In the particular context of reform, a series of initiatives taken by the Government since 2011 have made the work of the civil and public services more transparent, decision-making more accountable and service delivery more effective and efficient. Our Public Service 2020, which I launched last December, is a new policy framework designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus more on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. Progress in each of these areas, but especially innovation, will better position Ireland to meet the challenges arising in the global environment to which the Deputy refers. </p>  <p>  Certain of the eighteen specific actions set out in Our Public Service 2020, such as accelerating digital delivery of services, driving efficiency and effectiveness and promoting a culture of innovation in the public service are particularly relevant in this regard. A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the new reform agenda and lead on its implementation. This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which sets the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector.</p>  <p>  Public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services in July 2017. The guidelines facilitate Public Bodies in meeting their corporate governance requirements in relation to procurement. These guidelines provide a comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives and have been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. </p>  <p>  Procurement reform is a key element of the Government's overall reform programme and is aimed at delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the OGP and our sector partners in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.  </p>  <p>  The reform is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economy.  The aim is to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.   In this regard, Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government, where he hears at first hand the concerns of industry.</p></reply>

The imposes minimum payment requirements and provides the necessary tools to enforce those payments between the main contractor and their sub-contractors and so on down the supply chain.  It applies to all construction contracts (as defined in the Act), public or private sector, whether they are written or oral and whether they include payment provisions or not.</p><p>The Act provides important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry and includes:</p><p>- a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for sub-contractors;</p><p>- a right to suspension for non-payment; </p><p>- a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication; and</p><p>- the prohibition of arrangements that make entitlement to payment conditional on certain events, (e.g. &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; clauses, which delay payments until the payer has, in turn, been paid), which were prevalent in most forms of sub-contract.</p><p>The public works contracts were amended prior to the Act's commencement in June 2016 to accommodate its requirements and to facilitate cash flow in accordance with the payment terms imposed on main contractors with respect to their sub-contractors.</p><p>Whilst much of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that appears to be largely ignored.  Arguably these are the most important provisions in the Act but sub-contractors must be proactive in enforcing their entitlements with the contractor for payments that are due.</p><p>The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation/receivership and so where this arises the only route for recovery is through the normal insolvency process.  However the magnitude of the exposure that many sub-contractors currently face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise if the provision for payments were insisted upon and the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming.</p><p>It is unacceptable that sub-contractors are suffering losses as a result of the insolvency of a contractor on a construction project.  However the issue raised would suggest that sub-contractors are not exercising the rights provided for in the Construction Contracts Act which is surprising given the welcome it received by all contracting tiers in the industry and indeed the support it received from members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p><p>The Construction Contracts Adjudication Service in the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation has responsibility for matters in relation to the implementation of the Construction Contracts Act, 2013.  The Chairperson of the Ministerial Panel of Adjudicators has submitted an Annual Report on the implementation of the Construction Contracts Act, 2013 to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Act, Mr Pat Breen TD.  The second Annual Report covers the period from the 26th July 2017 to the 25th July 2018 and a copy of the report is available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for the formulation of policy, dissemination of best practice and guidance in public procurement.  The standard conditions of the public works contract contain provisions that determine the value and timing of the interim and final payments that arise during the course of a project's construction.  As you will appreciate I am not in a position to comment on specific payments arising under a particular contract as this is a matter for the contracting authority who awarded the contract.</p></reply>

Mary Immaculate College commenced the delivery of the Masters in Education (M.Ed.) on Irish-medium and Gaeltacht Education in September 2018, while Marino Institute of Education will deliver the Irish-medium initial teacher education B.Ed. programme from September 2019. </p>  <p>  On entry, candidates for each of  these new Irish medium teacher education programmes are required to have reached an Irish-language proficiency standard of &ldquo;independent user&rdquo; Level B1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages CEFRL) across all Irish-language competences (listening, reading, spoken interaction, spoken production, writing) following the completion of an externally administered Irish language proficiency test. This requirement is in addition to the existing entry requirement, which has been increased for all students entering primary ITE (see below). On exit from each of the two Irish-medium programmes, students must demonstrate that they have attained &ldquo;proficient user&rdquo; Level C1 (CEFRL) standard on exit from the Irish-medium B.Ed. and M.Ed. programmes, through the completion of an externally validated Irish-language proficiency test across all language competences (listening, reading, spoken interaction, spoken production, writing) in Irish.</p>  <p>  The additional entry and exit requirements for these two new Irish-medium teacher education programmes have been put in place to ensure that candidates are sufficiently proficient in the Irish language to enable them to engage fully with the programmes and to ensure that the programmes are meeting the objectives of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. </p>  <p>  The potential for provision of Irish-medium programmes in other ITE providers will be considered in light of the experience of the initial Irish-medium programme and their impact on meeting the teacher supply needs of  Irish-medium and Gaeltacht schools.</p>  <p>  From September 2019, the minimum level of Leaving Certificate Irish required at entry to programmes of primary ITE has been increased from a H5 to a H4 (Higher Level). All students who wish to enter the Irish-medium primary programme in Mary Immaculate College will need to fulfil this requirement, as well as the ones above. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is the statutory body charged with determining standards for the teaching profession and for accrediting programmes of initial teacher education. All initial teacher education programmes were re-conceptualised and extended, in accordance with the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education and Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (both 2011, the latter updated in 2017). The Teaching Council is currently undertaking a review of its Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers, which will consider, among other things, the impact of the re-conceptualised programmes for Initial Teacher Education on teaching and learning in Irish. </p>  <p>   Running in tandem with the introduction of new curricula at primary and post-primary, targeted continuing professional development opportunities for serving teachers are provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT). Furthermore, while they do not specifically address the teaching of other subjects through Irish, CPD in all other subjects and areas such as School Self-Evaluation and Leadership is delivered in Irish to Gaeltacht and Irish-medium schools by the JCT and PDST, inclusive of the use of pedagogical approaches.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  </p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.  It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides. Therefore it is important to understand that the demographic of neighbouring schools will not necessarily be the same and can indicate different levels of disadvantage based on the actual pupil cohort in each individual school. It is also important to note that the educational outcomes of the pupil cohort <b>do not</b>form any part of the identification process and are not taken into account when determining whether a schools should be allocated DEIS status. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>Following the application of the new identification process 79 additional schools were designated as DEIS and 30 urban primary schools were upgraded from DEIS Band 2 to DEIS Band 1.  These were schools that were identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.</p></reply>

This is done through initial teacher education programmes, education centres and support services for teachers at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. </p>  <p>  The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in their school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) advise that, by law, employers and those who control workplaces to any extent, must identify hazards in the workplaces under their control and assess the risk presented by the hazards.</p>  <p>  Employers must write down the risks and what to do about them. This is known as Risk Assessment. The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work. The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of the employer's Safety Statement.</p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: "Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place."</p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.</p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. </p>  <p>  The organisation of training in the administration of medicines is a matter for the Board of Management and my Department has no plans for future training programmes in this area.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.</p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions. </p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behavior must be proportionate.</p>  <p>  Tusla's Educational Welfare Service, under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.</p>  <p>  Following a request by the Department for policy advice from the NCSE, which provided recommendations in relation to crisis situations and complex behavioural needs, work on developing guidelines for schools is underway. The Department will engage with education partners on these in the coming months. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. The guidelines will assist schools in responding in circumstances where students pose an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others.</p>  <p>  The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.</p>  <p>  Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.</p>  <p>  Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla or to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with the Department's procedures.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its implementation Plan which was developed in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>In light of the difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the Government of the day, and subsequent Governments, deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2018, my Department will invest over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested. This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>Special classes by 138% to over 1,300 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Special education teachers by 38% from 9,630 in 2011 to over 13,300 at present in2018.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis. </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.  Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power to the National Council for Special Educational need to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>I can also advise that, whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement to provide individual education plans for children with special needs, at present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans. The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. In line with Circular 30/2014, schools are also required to put in place Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support while the Guidelines for schools on implementing the new special education teacher allocation model as point to the important to ensuring that student support plans or educational plans are in place.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made. </p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  All mainstream schools in Galway City and County receive a service from NEPS psychologists based in the Galway Office. While there are currently two psychologist vacancies in this office, all schools continue to have access to support and development, critical incident and advisory support from NEPS and pupil casework via their assigned psychologist or via SCPA. The school to which the Deputy refers in his question is receiving assessment services via SCPA.  This situation is temporary and replacement staff are currently being sought from recruitment panels administered by the Public Appointments Service. These are expected to be engaged by the end of this calendar year.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to the maintenance of our educational psychological service and the valuable supports it provides to our schools and would instance the announcement, in the context of last weeks&rsquo; Budget, of a further staffing increase of 10 psychologist posts for NEPS as tangible evidence of this ongoing commitment. </p></reply>

To assist schools, information on the adoption of tablets in schools is available on the PDST-Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) website, detailing what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.  Where the introduction of new technology is planned, there should be consultation with all members of the school community including parents.</p>  <p>   Earlier this year, my predecessor, Minister Bruton, issued a circular to all schools requiring them to consult with parents and the school community on the use of smart phones and digital devices in schools.  This requirement will be underpinned in law once the Parents and Students Charter is enacted. This bottom-up approach will ensure all parents, teachers and school communities are satisfied with the smart phone policy in place in their school. It will also mean that parents will be able to adopt a complimentary approach at home to what they know is in place in their child's school, if they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 is to promote responsible and ethical use of the internet and related technologies and to continue to undertake awareness-raising actions and programmes that promote responsible and ethical use of the internet. There are extensive training and curricular supports and resources available to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet, and related issues.  Information and resources are also  available for teachers, parents, and children through the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative which promotes the safe use of the internet by young people and raises awareness for parents on the associated risks. </p>  <p>   The Action Plan on Online Safety, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 11 July last and which is currently being implemented, recognises that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department, but that many Departments have a role to play. The Action Plan sets out 25 Actions and the Departments responsible for their delivery.  A sponsors group, chaired by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan. </p></reply>

This approach is in line with the recommendation by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which published its report in September. The Commission also recommended that recruitment to the Reserve be paused pending completion of the strategic review.</p>  <p>  The Commission's report is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration. My Department is engaged in a detailed consultation process and as part of this process, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  Once these engagements are completed, I will bring a High-level Implementation Plan and proposed project structure to Government for approval before the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  I would advise any candidate with a query on the status of their application for entry into the Garda Reserve to contact the Garda Appointments Office directly. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, there is a current investigation being conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission into conduct which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more Garda members. That investigation is on-going and I do not propose to comment on that matter while the investigation is proceeding. GSOC is independent and it would be entirely inappropriate of me to comment where I have no authority to do so.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by GSOC that the outcome of that investigation will be submitted to the GSOC Commissioners as soon as is practicable.  Upon receipt of the report, GSOC will, in accordance with section 97 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, submit a report to the Garda Commissioner outlining its findings.  It will also contain a recommendation about whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Disciplinary Regulations against any of the Garda members subject of the investigation.</p>  <p>  In response to the motion passed by this House before the summer recess calling for an investigation into Shane O'Farrell&rsquo;s death, the Government must respect fully the independence of GSOC.  The motion referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the Courts.  The Government recognises the failings that occurred in the run up to this tragic incident and GSOC, the independent authority established by an Act of the Oireachtas, should be allowed to complete its investigation unhindered. </p>  <p>  Having said that, I want to reiterate the Government's undertaking that when the GSOC investigations are completed, the question of what further action might be taken will be considered.</p></reply>

Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed.  Over the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.  In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.  </p><p>The Irish Prison Service now proposes to further develop the Mountjoy site over the period 2021-2031 as referenced in the National Development Plan.  The aim is to bring the remainder of the prison up to an acceptable modern standard capable of serving custody and rehabilitation needs into the future.  </p><p>In the meantime, the Thornton Hall site which is fully serviced and adjacent to Dublin airport remains in my Department&rsquo;s ownership and in recent years a working group, which included representation from the OPW, considered future use options for the site. This included discussions with Fingal County Council.  More recently, the site has also been flagged to the Department of Housing and Local Government. As such, the site will be considered both in the context of broader State requirements for land assets and future requirements in relation to detention of prisoners.</p><p>As requested by the Deputy, the table below has been updated to include the costs in respect of ongoing maintenance, repairs and utilities up to the end of 2017. </p><p>Maintenance, Repairs &amp;amp; Utilities (&euro;)<table><tr><th>Year</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>248,190</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>117,930</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>62,001</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>74,999</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (Directive (EU) /2015/849) requires Member States to extend the application of anti-money laundering laws to all providers of gambling services, unless it can be shown that a particular gambling sub-sector is low risk. A risk assessment of the gambling industry in Ireland was carried out by a subcommittee of the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Committee, chaired by the Department of Finance. The assessment indicated that while certain subsectors - such as lotteries and amusement machines - could be considered to be low risk, others, such as bookmaking, were assessed as having a medium-low risk. As a result, the State is required to extend its anti-money laundering law to gambling services which are not proven low risk. I intend to bring forward a statutory instrument, in conjunction with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2018, to put this into effect. </p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.   </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission (MHC) and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.

The Minister for Health established this multidisciplinary working group on 17th of October 2016 under section 91(2) of the 2015 Act. The role of the working group is to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service, in relation to codes of practice and this process is ongoing. The Director will subsequently prepare a Code(s) of Practice and will submit it to the Minister for Health for his approval and, with the Minister for Health's consent, the Director will then publish the Code of Practice.</p>  <p>  The preparation of the Code of Practice will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Part 8 of the Act, pertaining to AHDs, in its entirety. </p></reply>

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target the assets, wherever situated, of persons which derive or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. </p><p>The Bureau utilises the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime legislation as well as Revenue and Social Welfare legislation in targeting the proceeds of crime generated from a range of criminal activities.</p><p>The Bureau is a statutory, multi-agency body with staff drawn from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality. </p><p>The Bureau is also supported in its work by 345 trained asset profilers nation-wide. These asset profilers work hand-in-hand with local Garda Management and communities towards the objective of denying and depriving criminals of assets. </p><p>Section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 requires the Bureau, through the Garda Commissioner, to provide a report of its activities each year to the Minister for Justice and Equality who is then required to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas. The Bureau's Annual Reports include details of the Bureau's pay and non-pay expenditure in each of the years from 2007 to 2017. These reports can be found on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's and my own Department's websites.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of the expenditure of the Bureau in each of the years from 2007 to 2017 in the categories requested by the Deputy is available at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

Microfinance Ireland also works with partners to help potential applicants with their applications. Applicants can work with their Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) or Local Development Companies to assist them in making the application. A 1% reduction in the interest rate is available on applications submitted through the LEOs or Local Development Companies.  can be made to MFI through LEOs or Local Development Companies. </p>  <p>  To ensure the provision of ongoing and relevant support to microenterprises preparations are currently underway in my Department for an independent review of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, which will begin in early 2019.</p></reply>

This was important, as the on-site panels reviewing the various Research Centres were comprised of different reviewers. The Oversight Panel was also requested to make a recommendation to the SFI Executive and Board on whether each centre should either receive additional new term funding, should not be funded for a new term, or should progress to an open competition, to be reviewed against other potential centre applicants in 2020. </p><p>Oversight panel precedence:</p><p>A two-stage peer review process comprising expert assessments, such as those conducted through the on-site reviews, followed by a final review panel (i.e., oversight panel) deliberation is considered to be international best practice by the European Science Foundation (an independent, non-governmental, non-profit organisation that promotes the highest quality science in Europe). Indeed, an external evaluation of other SFI funding programmes which adopt a similar review process involving a final oversight panel concluded that the review process compares favourably to processes used internationally by other government sponsored funding agencies. </p><p>Science Foundation Ireland funds research based on robust and rigorous international peer review processes.  These international best practice processes have led to Ireland now being ranked in 11<sup>th</sup>place in global scientific ranking &ndash; a dramatic rise which has occurred since the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland in 2003.  This quality assurance stage, put in place by Science Foundation Ireland, ensures Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a location of world class research.  </p><p>SFI, in its capacity as an independent agency of my Department has conducted a review process in accordance with best international practice. I am satisfied that the recommendation of the review panel and the subsequent decision of the SFI Board to invite the INFANT Research Centre to progress to an open competition in 2020 for future funding is both fair and appropriate.  </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).

This process ensures that treatments that are clinical and cost effective are reimbursed. In circumstances where a company has failed to demonstrate the clinical benefit to support the price that it is seeking for its treatment, the HSE reaches a decision not to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  Kuvan (sapropterin) is a medicinal product for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).

Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. </p>  <p>  With regard to Monaghan Hospital, the Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these smaller hospitals. As a Model 2 hospital, in line with the Smaller Hospitals Framework, Monaghan Hospital has a Minor Injuries Unit located on site which provides an important service to the local community. I recently met with the RCSI Hospital Group to discuss how all hospitals within the group can develop and contribute to improvements in both scheduled and unscheduled care for patients.</p>  <p>  I am committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan provides &euro;10.9 billion for Health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care. Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue. As to be expected with a ten year plan, many proposals are at an early stage and will require to progress through appraisal, planning design and tender before a firm timeline or funding required can be established.</p>  <p>  As these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The EU definition of SME is: "Enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;43 million."</p>  <p>  In so doing, the Directive seeks to contribute to ensuring a fair standard of living for those producers who are particularly vulnerable to UTPs. Such producers have the least bargaining power, and are least able to address UTPs without negative effects on their economic viability, particulary in the case of agricultural products which are perishable and seasonal, and subject to adverse weather conditions. </p>  <p>  Trilogues between the Council, Commission and European Parliament are taking place with a view to begin to seek agreement on a final version of the Directive. In agreeing to move to Trilogues, the Special Committee on Agriculture took note of the pending concerns expressed by several delegations in relation to the issue of the scope of the draft Directive. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the organisation referred to in the accompanying correspondance and I would be happy to recieve any further written submissions.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support the removal of trees affected by the disease and the reconstitution of the forest with alternative species to ash including more commercial conifer species. Forest owners need to be aware of possible changes to premiums if conifers are chosen. While owners can fell ten hectares or more in these situations, in cases involving the replacement of more than 10 hectares of broadleaf high forest by conifer species there may be a requirement for planning permission and if so there may be restrictions associated with that planning permission under the Planning and Development Act. This is for the relevant Planning Authority to determine, and any person may request (for a prescribed fee), under Section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a declaration on the matter from their Local Planning Authority. </p>  <p>  In terms of further support, the revised Woodland Improvement Scheme will allow eligible landowners to avail of a second thinning grant.

In the context of the consideration of each of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, it is now a matter for the Joint Committee to consider whether and how each recommendation might be taken up by Government.  In this context, the Committee is engaging with all relevant Government Departments on their respective policies in place and their position in response to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommendations. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to note that many of the recommendations adopted by the Citizens' Assembly are already being addressed through the implementation of National Development Plan, the National Mitigation Plan and the Energy White Paper. A number of these recommendations are within my own Department&rsquo;s remit.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 addresses the leadership role of the State in addressing climate change. My Department published a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2017 which provides for a coordinated, whole-of Government approach to meeting the Government&rsquo;s target of improving its own energy efficiency by 33% by 2020 and thereby reducing the contribution of the public sector to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. The Strategy provides, inter alia, that public bodies are required to implement the Nearly Zero Energy Building standard two years in advance of the private sector and also provides a framework for investment in public building retrofits. </p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 5, the Government launched, on 31 July, a grant- aided pilot micro generation scheme, targeting solar PV and domestic customers with self-generation. The pilot scheme also supports the use of battery storage for installations over a certain size. This is in line with industry best practice where installations are sized appropriately with the maximum amount of renewable electricity generated being consumed on site by the customer.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 addresses community ownership of renewable energy projects. The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme will provide for communities to develop their own renewable electricity projects and for developer-led projects to offer investment opportunities to local citizens and communities. </p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 9, a strong package of measures to support the roll out of electric vehicles is now in place, supporting the NDP objective of having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030.</p>  <p>  While much progress has been made in relation to a number of the Assembly&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government recognises that further consideration will need to be given to some of the report&rsquo;s other proposals, including through the ongoing work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action. In light of this, I look forward to engaging with the Joint Committee on its work in the near future.</p></reply>

Today, more than 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. The NBP will be achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage with evaluation ongoing of the final tender received on 18 September. The Taoiseach has asked the independent process auditor to the NBP procurement to review the process. Mr. Smyth will submit a report to the Taoiseach and to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment within three weeks from 17 October. This review will take place in parallel with the evaluation being carried out by the Department&rsquo;s procurement team on the final tender for the NBP State led intervention.</p><p>As part of the commercial investment element of the NBP, in April 2017, my Department signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas. A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>Data for Q2 2018 submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company had passed some 175,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements </p></reply>

The transition has involved moving from a payment in arrears system to a real-time system for IB. </p><p>The Department acknowledges that this move has caused difficulties for some customers leading to a large volume of calls to its helpline and long delays in responding to calls. In order to address this issue, the Department has deployed additional staff to manage customer calls.</p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that all IB customers will be paid the correct amount for the period of their illness - as certified by their GP.  Any customer who has an urgent financial need can apply to the Department's Community Welfare Service to receive an interim payment. Customers in these circumstances should get in touch with thier local Intreo Centre.</p><p>My Department is working hard to resolve these payment issues as quickly as possible. </p><p>The IB claim for the person concerned was certified and paid up until 10th October 2018.

Part of this also involved the AHBs examining models that will facilitate private financing, now having regard also to the recent reclassification decision by Eurostat of the larger Tier 3 AHBs in 2018. Two phases of the work have now been completed.  The first stage was to produce up to date market testing for social housing financing from financial bodies and investors, including credit unions, which was completed in mid-2017. The second stage included considering the demand and terms from AHBs for such off balance sheet financing to inform heads of terms for financial investors. This was completed in January 2018.</p>  <p>  The third phase of work is still ongoing due to a number of issues and changes in the operating environment that have arisen in recent months.  Considerable and complex work has been undertaken to date, with a particular focus on how to increase the level of private financing for these larger Tier 3 AHBs involved in the project, and the most appropriate structure that meets their needs.</p>  <p>  To date, one AHB has established and implemented a special purpose vehicle for a specific purpose, including a lending facility for accessing and using &euro;50m of private finance from a financial institution.  In recent months, this facility has been used to acquire and develop properties sourced through the Housing Agency Acquisitions Programme.   In addition, another AHB  involved has, arising from work in this project, obtained private finance from a private financial institution and this has been used in the development of new housing by the AHB to meet Government social housing delivery targets in 2018 and 2019. </p>  <p>   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

As such, therefore, the National Library have not confirmed to my Department that any irreplaceable items are formally missing. </p>  <p>  Once the stock checks are complete the National Library of Ireland will provide an update to my Department. </p></reply>
