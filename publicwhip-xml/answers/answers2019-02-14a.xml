    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400054#WRA00600"><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Commission proposal for an interim Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 3% levy on the turnover of certain companies&rsquo; digital activities, was discussed extensively last year among Member States &ndash; both at a technical and political level.  </p>  <p>  In December the proposal was brought before ECOFIN for political decision where it was clear that a number of Member States did not support its adoption. At the meeting, France and Germany unexpectedly tabled an amended proposal which in essence restricted the scope of the proposal to cover only digital advertising. My fellow Ministers and I agreed that we would need time to assess this new proposal and would return to the matter once we had done so.</p>  <p>  I have had various conversations with my fellow Ministers about the proposal and the December ECOFIN was held in public session.  I expect that the issue will again be discussed by Ministers at the March ECOFIN. </p>  <p>  The new proposal fails to address the principled concerns I have consistently expressed about a proposed EU Digital tax &ndash; principally that it is based on taxing revenues rather than profits. In fact, the restricted nature of the proposal merely intensifies the concerns that this could be perceived as targeting specific companies and has the potential to aggravate tensions in the international trading arena.  While the Directive has therefore not been agreed, a number of Member States have announced that they are moving ahead with their own plans for domestic digital taxes. </p>  <p>  It should be recalled that all EU Member States support solutions for taxation of the digital economy to be reached globally at the OECD, and I do not believe that Europe should move ahead of or in a different direction to the work being done at OECD. This work is well under way and a public consultation is now underway giving stakeholders a chance to contribute to this work.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400054#WRA00900"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that subject to current market conditions prevailing NAMA projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3.5bn to be returned to the State once it completes its work. The realisation of this surplus depends on the redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes. </p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA must first use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full, which is expected to be in 2020. Following this NAMA will be in a position to start transferring its expected &euro;3.5bn surplus to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs. </p>  <p>  In the meantime NAMA is making a significant contribution to housing supply where it is in a position to do so. NAMA&rsquo;s residential funding programme is expected to fund the completion of 20,000 residential units by the end of 2020. NAMA is on track to meet this target with over 9,700 delivered directly and 3,400 indirectly at the end of 2018. In addition, NAMA has an established policy of identifying to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies, properties within its portfolio which may be suitable for social housing. To date nearly 7,000 such properties have been identified, with demand confirmed for 2,717 and 2,475 delivered or committed. Part of this delivery has been through NAMA&rsquo;s innovative National Asset Residential Property Services (NARPS) model, which has purchased over 1,350 properties from NAMA debtors and leased them on for social housing.</p></reply>

In a 'no deal' scenario, intensive discussions between the Government, the EU Commission and EU partners will be required regarding the movement of goods North-South and the protecting of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. I am assured by Revenue that they will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance is required by the Government to facilitate those discussions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that their preparations do not include any plans for infrastructure at the border with Northern Ireland. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s position in the matter. The Deputy will be aware that the Revenue Chairman, Niall Cody, set out this position clearly when he and Revenue officials appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 24 January 2019.</p></reply>

His request arose on foot of some negative feedback that the Minister of State had received from policyholders regarding delays in claims being processing in relation to these storms.</p>  <p>  In this context, Minister of State D'Arcy and officials met directly with a number of the largest insurance companies operating in the State to discuss their individual responses as well as to seek information with regard to how the claims process was handled since the storms.  The meetings also provided an opportunity for the issues that the Minister of State had received feedback on to be set out to the various insurance companies.  Meetings also took place with representatives of loss assessors and a number of insurance brokers from an area which was heavily impacted by Storm Emma.  Following these meetings, a summary of the key points raised during the meetings on the factors that had influenced the speed at which claims may have been settled was prepared.  This document was presented to the Minister of State for his consideration and in response he has asked that the concerns expressed be further examined by members of the CIWG over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy regarding the numbers of policyholders impacted after Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  I understand however from Insurance Ireland data provided to my Department in June 2018 that there were approximately 11,900 respective claims arising from the storms, which gives the Deputy a sense of the scale of the numbers of policyholders impacted.</p></reply>

This consultation process involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p><p>In addition, my officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland. Furthermore, I understand, Minister of State D'Arcy with responsibility for insurance matters, has met separately with representatives from insurance companies and other stakeholders in relation to a number of issues. The problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p><p>Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>and the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>provide more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.  The seventh quarterly update was published in November and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website while the eighth quarterly report is currently being prepared. </p><p>It should be noted that the Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its two Reports.  It is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations from both Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.</p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.16% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that premiums are still at a high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400054#WRA02200"><p>The Government remains firmly of the view that ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement, agreed between the EU and the UK, remains the best way to ensure an orderly UK exit from the EU.  A 'no deal' Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU, and dealing with it would be an exercise in damage limitation.</p><p>While ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement is still the Government's preferred outcome, it has also put in place a series of measures, both nationally and in conjunction with the EU, in preparation for the possibility that the UK fails to agree a deal for its departure from the EU on 29 March 2019. </p><p>At its meeting on 11 December 2018, the Government decided to give greater immediate priority to the preparations for a no deal Brexit. This work is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and involves all Government Departments and agencies.  Given the proximity of the date of Brexit, contingency planning has moved to taking actions to mitigate the risks of a no deal Brexit, without prejudice to the Government&rsquo;s priority of finalising the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. This includes putting the necessary legislation in place.</p><p>On 24 January, the Government published the General Scheme for the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill. The Scheme focuses on those areas that need to be addressed urgently and immediately through primary legislation to protect our citizens and to support the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.</p><p>The elements of the General Scheme which relate to my areas of responsibility are parts 6, 7 and 8 as follows:</p><p><i><i>In Part 6</i></i>, legislative amendments are proposed for Income Tax, Capital Tax, Corporation Tax and Stamp Duty legislation in order to ensure continuity for business and citizens in relation to current access to certain taxation reliefs and allowances, and the retention of a number of anti-avoidance provisions in the event that the UK is no longer a member of the EU/EEA.</p><p><i><i>In Part 7</i></i>, legislative measures are proposed to support the implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s equivalence decision under the Central Securities Depositories (CSD) Regulation providing continuity for the settlement of trading in Irish equities.</p><p><i><i>In Part 8</i></i>, legislative measures are proposed to provide for a temporary run-off regime, which, subject to a number of conditions, will enable insurance undertakings and intermediaries to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers for a period of three years after the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  </p><p>In addition, at the Government meeting on 5 February, the Cabinet also approved a number of further tax proposals including the introduction of Postponed Accounting for VAT in order to alleviate cash flow impacts for business, and amendments to Section 56 VAT relief authorisations to mitigate the potential for abuse.</p><p>It is intended to publish the full text of the Bill on 22 February 2019 and as the timelines are tight for the necessary ratification, the Government will work very closely with all Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in ensuring that the necessary no deal Brexit related legislation will be in place before the 29 March. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400054#WRA02500"><p>It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of property between spouses are exempt. All inheritances taken by a spouse from his or her spouse since January 1985 are exempt from tax and are not taken into account in computing tax. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners with effect from 1 January 2011. </p>  <p>  As a result of the full tax exemption that applies, spouses and civil partners are not included in any of the tax-free Group thresholds and inheritances between spouses and civil partners are not counted for the purposes of aggregating lifetime inheritances. There are three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. The Group A threshold (currently &euro;320,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. </p>  <p>  Any prior inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives inheritances that are in excess of their relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.</p>  <p>  While single individuals may not bequeath property free of inheritance tax under the spouse or civil partner exemption, they may bequeath property or assets to individuals free from inheritance tax provided the value of the property or assets does not exceed the relevant tax-free Group thresholds when previous bequests to the individual are taken into account.  </p>  <p>  In addition, single individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax which allows for property to be inherited tax-free irrespective of its value where the beneficiary is already living in the house subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Agricultural property and relevant business property of a single individual can also be bequeathed with a significant 90% reduction in their taxable values under the Agricultural Relief and Business Relief schemes where the relevant conditions are met.</p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, across relevant tax heads including inheritance tax, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirement to protect the institution of marriage.

The group included representatives from Revenue; the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine; the Department of Health; the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Service; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; the OPW; the Department of Justice; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Rosslare Europort, the group identified the infrastructural requirements including service and accommodation requirements. Following a Government Decision in September 2018, the OPW were tasked with leading the engagement with relevant stakeholders, with a view to ensuring that the necessary additional infrastructure for both the central case and the no-deal scenarios becomes operational in a timely manner. This work is ongoing towards having the necessary temporary facilities in place to cater for a no-deal scenario in March 2019 as well as permanent facilities in place by 1 January 2021. </p>  <p>  As regards staffing and resources, I am advised that Revenue are on track to have appointed over 400 additional staff nationally to customs and related roles for Brexit during the period September 2018 to 29 March 2019. 30 of these additional 400 staff are being assigned to Rosslare Europort. These additional staff will bring the total Revenue staff in Rosslare EuroPort to approximately 50 by 29 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised that on 30 January, Revenue, together with Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, hosted a Customs Brexit Information seminar in Wexford town. This was part of an extensive trader engagement program where they contacted traders who trade with the UK highlighting the Brexit-related Revenue supports and inviting them to a series of Revenue Brexit seminars. The seminars provide traders with the opportunity to speak directly with Revenue experts across a range of specific Customs themes as well as with experts from other Government Departments. Revenue will continue its engagement with and support of trade and business providing them with timely information in relation to unfolding political and policy developments.</p></reply>

It is intended to allow the Government of the day to mitigate the effects of such a downturn. </p><p>The aim in establishing the Fund is that in the event of a future shock, we can maintain expenditure programmes, and capital programmes in particular. Maintaining capital investment will have demand and supply side benefits by supporting employment and future productive capacity, and it will also help us escape the self-perpetuating recessionary cycle of a sudden economic shock.</p><p>The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill passed 2nd Stage recently Thursday, 31 January. Section 9 of the Bill sets out the criteria for drawdown of the Fund.</p><p>The first element of the criteria for drawdown is that the Minister for Finance of the day must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that drawdown is necessary to:</p><p>- remedy or mitigate exceptional circumstances, or;</p><p>- prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State, or;</p><p>- support major structural reforms with long-term positive budgetary effects. </p><p>Indicators to establish whether &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; exist could include factors such as a sharp and significant increase in unemployment, or a dramatic fall-off in tax receipts. </p><p>The Bill proposes a clear role for the Oireachtas in that money will not be paid out other than pursuant to a D&aacute;il resolution passed on foot of a proposal from the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance must also consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before deciding whether to make the proposal.  </p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot predict with any great certainty what will trigger a future economic shock. What is certain is that there are external risks and challenges.  The issue of cost overruns in the building of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, while a matter of grave concern, and one which must be addressed, would not be considered &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; under the criteria proposed for the &quot;National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund&quot;.</p></reply>

In keeping with established practice, a copy of the response was also published on my Department&rsquo;s website. Given its independent nature, I do not as a matter of course hold formal meetings with the Council. However, in terms of parliamentary scrutiny of the Budget, last month I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Budget Oversight Committee to discuss the Council&rsquo;s November FAR. This allowed for a positive exchange with Committee members around some of the main issues arising from Budget 2019, as well as the assessment report. </p>  <p>  In terms of the Council&rsquo;s assessment of the fiscal stance, I note that the Council assessed the Irish economy to be operating at close to potential and that the outlook remains broadly positive. This is an assessment that is broadly similar to that of my own Department. I undoubtedly share the Council&rsquo;s views on the risks facing the economy and the current uncertainties arising from the external environment has been a significant part of my decision to target a balanced budget this year. Indeed, it is important to stress that a surplus of about &frac12; per cent of GDP would have been in prospect had the Government not decided to increase capital expenditure by almost a quarter this year, which in turn will boost the productive capacity and further enhance the resilience of the economy.  </p>  <p>   Finally, it is also worth noting that the European Commission which has responsibility for assessing our compliance with the fiscal rules, assessed Budget 2019 as being compliant with the fiscal rules. This is a positive endorsement of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary policy and the underlying fiscal stance we have adopted as part of Budget 2019. </p></reply>

Consequently, I am precluded from giving any direction or instruction to Revenue in this regard.

The purpose of the FRE review is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category will be examined separately in light of the legislative requirements.  Only those categories which meet the criteria for deduction in the legislation will be in a position to retain a FRE.  It is intended to have the review completed for all categories by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed there is no change to the implementation date of 1 January 2020 for any changes that may be made to the FRE regime, to ensure the changes do not impact on any specific group earlier than the rest.  </p></reply>

The most recent of these, published in October 2018, concluded as follows:</p><p><b>- Prices: </b>While there may have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive, the primary driver of house prices remains the continued misalignment between demand and supply.</p><p><b>- Supply:  </b>The evidence suggests that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which can be attributed in part to HTB.</p><p><b>- Affordability: </b>The analysis also finds that availability of HTB has reduced the time to save for all claimants and improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.</p><p><b>- Benefit/Cost Ratio:</b>The analysis finds a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive but note that if the price of new HTB units was to increase due to the incentive, the net benefit would be reduced.</p><p>As would be normal, the role of the incentive will be examined in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill process.

The report titled <i>&lsquo;Exploring affordability in the Irish housing market&rsquo;, </i>found that<i></i>affordability pressures are not universal and are most acute in the private rented sector, those living in the Greater Dublin Area and those on low incomes. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic growth has allowed average wages to show consistent year-on-year growth since the beginning of 2016, with growth picking up in strength through 2017 and 2018. The most recent data available show the average weekly wage grew by 3.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018. Although such growth rates are relatively high, the pace of inflation in the private rented and owner-occupier sectors over recent years has, unfortunately, been higher. Residential property prices increased by 7.1 per cent in the year to November 2018. The latest data from the RTB show that rents rose by 7.5 per cent year-on year in the third quarter of 2018.</p><p>The long-term solution to increasing affordability is to increase the supply of appropriate housing, including social, affordable and private housing. In response to this challenge -  and in addition to the measures being implemented under &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo; - Budget 2019 contained initiatives aimed at increasing the supply of new homes. In 2019, a total capital investment of &euro;1.4 billion will be made in housing. Some &euro;310 million over three years will be made available for delivery of affordable homes through the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). Further, my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who has primary responsibility for housing policy, has brought forward a number of programmes to tackle the issue of affordability, including an affordable purchase scheme and a new cost rental programme. </p><p>The Department of Finance will continue to monitor developments in the housing sector in the context of increasing affordability and maintaining our competitiveness.</p></reply>

VAT rating is determined on the basis of particular goods and services, not by goods or services as a whole.</p>  <p>  Under existing VAT rating rules, Member States must apply a standard VAT rate of at least 15% and may apply up to two reduced VAT rates of 5% or more to a set list of socially inclined goods and services.  Member States may also retain historic VAT treatment that applied before 1 January 1991, including the application of a zero rate or a rate below 5%.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates a standard VAT rate of 23%, reduced VAT rates of 13.5% and 9%, and historically applies the zero rate and a super-reduced rate of 4.8%.   </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2018 the European Commission published a proposal on the Simplification of VAT rates, which allows greater freedom for Member States in setting VAT rates in line with the move to the definitive destination based system of VAT.  The proposal will be discussed at European Council and must be agreed unanimously by all Member States before being adopted.  It is expected that discussions on the proposal will be robust and it is likely that the final agreed text will be the subject of many compromised amendments.</p></reply>

Tax reliefs or incentives are primarily relevant to profit-making businesses with potential tax liabilities, whereas new small businesses may often be loss-making in their early establishment phases.  Direct expenditure supports such as grants, innovation vouchers and Enterprise Ireland funds are potentially more effective policy tools in this area. </p></reply>

This is set out in the Government Programme. </p>  <p>  In September last year, at an event organised by IBEC, I indicated that looking beyond Budget 2019, if economic circumstances allow, we would continue to reduce the tax burden on middle-income earners by increasing the standard rate cut-off point over a number of Budgets to a level that is competitive with our neighbouring jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Government position is that workers start to pay too high a rate of income tax at too low an income level.  We cannot hope to remain competitive if someone on a relatively low income and who decides to work a few hours overtime has nearly half that extra money taken in tax.  Such a position informed my approach in the last two Budgets where, on each occasion, I increased the level of the standard rate band.  The impact is that fewer people on incomes around the national average have any income subject to the 40% rate of income tax than would otherwise have been the case.</p>  <p>  Overall, therefore, the policy of widening the standard rate band is not a new one.</p>  <p>  As I have stated on many occasions, we plan to continue this progress in the coming years within available resources, to make sure that Ireland remains competitive.  </p></reply>

Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 21 per cent.  </p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In December 2018, annual inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices was at just 0.8 per cent, having averaged 0.7 per cent throughout 2018. This follows five consecutive years of inflation below 1 per cent. Although price pressures have emerged in both the housing and the rental markets, this reflects the undersupply of housing over the last number of years, rather than evidence of over-heating pressures.</p>  <p>  In terms of domestic risks, while the baseline projections assume that some moderate overheating pressures will emerge over the medium-term, particularly in the context of the expected increase in housing output, these pressures could be more significant than expected with the potential to generate imbalances over the coming years and impact on competitiveness.</p>  <p>  As I outlined in Budget 2019, our economy is also facing a number of external risks. These risks primarily relate to a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit, a rise in protectionism and a faster than expected normalisation of monetary policy. There is also continuing evidence of a slowdown in global growth, as has been recently reported by the IMF and the European Commission.</p>  <p>  As many of the risks we are facing are external and thus beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, particularly those that increase productivity. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged of late, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.</p></reply>

From these engagements, it would appear that the main difficulty in these sectors is a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in these sectors. </p><p>In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore,  part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.  </p><p>The Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Therefore I cannot compel insurers to provide cover to businesses such as play centres or marts.</p><p>The above said however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.

It is also commonly referred to internationally as non-bank financial intermediation or market-based finance.  </p>  <p>  According to the recently published Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2018, as at the end of 2017 the assets of the non-bank financial intermediation sector operating in Ireland was estimated at &euro;2.3 trillion. The shadow banking system, as defined by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is composed of a number of sub-sectors and is made up mainly of investment funds, special purpose entities and credit derivative holdings. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that the largest component of the Irish-domiciled shadow banking sector is collective investment vehicles (investment funds). Investment Funds are subject to an extensive set of EU body rules in the form of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive. These are supplemented by domestic Irish requirements under Central Bank regulations and rules.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is an active participant on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in the international debate on shadow banking. This includes participating in the Financial Stability Board's global non-bank financial intermediation monitoring exercise and the international policy debate in IOSCO and the ESRB. </p>  <p>  The Bank has also informed me that the global package of regulatory reforms since the crisis, including the relevant non-bank elements, has been an appropriate response to the vulnerabilities in the system that the crisis exposed. </p>  <p>  These reforms include the Financial Stability Board's global monitoring framework to identify non-bank financial intermediation risks; addressing liquidity mismatches and the build-up of leverage in investment funds; reforms in the EU in relation to money market funds; the movement towards central clearing of derivative transactions and facilitating the standardisation of securitisation.</p>  <p>  Finally, my officials will continue to monitor and participate in discussions on regulatory reform in the financial sector at the various groups and committee at EU level and advise me accordingly on developments. With the large amount of European regulatory frameworks that have come into place within the last number of years that has a significant part of the Irish non-bank financial intermediation within its scope, there are no plans currently to introduce specific domestic legislation on this issue at this point. </p></reply>

In addition to the award levels as the Deputy will be aware there can also be significant costs over and above such awards including legal, medical and other costs.  Data from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Motor Key Information Reports suggested such costs can be up to 40% of the award level provided in cases involving litigation.  </p>  <p>  As a result the Working Group established the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and commissioned it to carry out a benchmarking exercise of award levels in other countries amongst other things.  It reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher than in the UK and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. It recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum.  In doing this the PIC believes that the Judicial Council  will, in compiling the guidelines, take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal and the results of its benchmarking exercise etc.  However as legislation is required to establish this body, the PIC recommended that an interim judicial council be put in place initially to commence this process.   </p>  <p>  As responsibility for the Judicial Council legislation, and any interim solution rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan TD, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy recently wrote to him to express his views on the matter.  In this correspondence, he has requested that Minister Flanagan engage with the judiciary to seek their agreement to convene an interim Judicial Council with the purposes of preparing guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury, as recommended by the PIC.  It is hoped that if there was a significant move in this area, it could have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the market. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise the importance the Government places on continuing to tackle the problem of the high cost of insurance and that it remains a priority for it.  I will continue to engage with my colleagues in particular the Minister for Justice and Equality on the broader law reform aspects of this very important project.</p></reply>

The Government is also committed to encouraging greater competition in the banking sector and supporting better access to banking and financial services across the country.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in line with Programme for a Partnership Government commitments my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published a joint report on &ldquo;Local Public Banking in Ireland&rdquo; in July of last year. While the Report concluded that, for a number of reasons, there is not a compelling case for the State to establish a new local public banking system in Ireland, as proposed, the Government does recognise a number of positive aspects underlying the concept of community banking generally, including access to finance for SMEs and supporting local communities and economies. </p>  <p>  Indeed, many of the objectives of community banking align with Government policy and supports that have already been put in place. Additionally the network infrastructure, ethos and many of the objectives envisaged by community banking are already represented by the Credit Union sector in Ireland and I believe that Credit Unions are well placed to develop to meet any local public banking needs not currently being provided.</p>  <p>  One of the areas which Credit Unions need to develop, if they are to fulfil the full role envisaged by community banking, does indeed relate to SME financing. Credit Unions currently have ample capacity to engage in more SME lending. While Credit Union lending to SMEs grew from &euro;77 million as of September 2017 to &euro;93 million as of September 2018 &ndash; a 20% increase year on year &ndash; the current lending regulations allow capacity for SME lending of up to c.&euro;900 million. </p>  <p>  Separately, following on from the Local Public Banking Report my Department has arranged for an independent evaluation to be carried out in order to consider how the objectives of community banking and how the local provision of banking and financial services could be furthered in Ireland through other delivery mechanisms. One of these potential delivery mechanisms is the credit union sector. Following a competitive tender process, I can confirm that Indecon has been appointed as the consultants to carry out the independent evaluation. They will also establish and conduct a stakeholder forum on community banking and the local provision of banking and financial services. </p>  <p>  Credit union stakeholders were consulted in advance in relation to the Local Public Banking Report. Credit unions have also been consulted by the Central Bank in relation to changes to credit union lending regulations, including changes related to SME lending, which will be completed during 2019 and the investment regulations which were amended in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I hosted a Credit Union event last week, which was attended by Credit Union stakeholders including the representative bodies, at which I outlined my support for, and belief in, the Credit Union sector's potential to meet any community banking needs.  Achieving this potential will require credit unions to develop their capacity and to collaborate effectively though shared service structures to ensure they can deliver services in a timely and cost effective manner.  In this regard I welcome the initiatives currently underway.</p></reply>

Regrettably the UK are leaving the EU and that means that some things are going to change. Planning for this change has been taking place on a whole-of-Government basis since before the UK referendum and the Government has been preparing for every eventuality and have been taking the necessary measures to implement actions to mitigate the risks, as far as is possible. </p>  <p>  While ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement is still the Government's preferred outcome, it has also put in place a series of measures, both nationally and in conjunction with the EU, in preparation for the possibility that the UK fails to agree a deal for its departure from the EU on 29 March 2019. Given the proximity of the date of Brexit, contingency planning has now moved to taking actions to mitigate the risks of a no deal Brexit, without prejudice to the Government&rsquo;s priority of finalising the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018, sets out comprehensive, whole of Government approach on no deal planning. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  Indeed, the Department of Finance has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy - commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue, including before the referendum. What is clear from this research and other studies is that the harder the Brexit the more negative the impact on Ireland. The Department and the ESRI are currently preparing a more comprehensive update of their original work and the results will be published later this quarter. A no deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU, and dealing with it would be an exercise in damage limitation. </p>  <p>  My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and is coordinating closely with its agencies who are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. All are engaging closely in the overall whole-of-Government preparations, and are confident that they have put appropriate contingency measures in place to do everything possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, in the event of a no deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. </p>  <p>  In relation to funding the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit. The Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong. </p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant programme of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing and engagement across the country with the business community to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade to the maximum extent possible in a no deal scenario. </p>  <p>  At a general level, the Government has already taken significant actions to get Ireland Brexit ready. Since the UK referendum, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. This is supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure. The Government is also providing dedicated loan funds for affected businesses. </p>  <p>  The Government is also developing the additional physical infrastructure needed at ports and airports, in order to ensure that East-West trade continues to move as smoothly as possible.  At Dublin and Rosslare Ports, sites suitable for temporary infrastructure have been identified and refurbishment work has commenced. At the same time, plans are advanced for the development of permanent infrastructure in both Ports. </p>  <p>  The Government published the General Scheme for the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, on 24 January. The draft Scheme focuses on those areas that need to be addressed urgently and immediately through primary legislation to protect our citizens and to support the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors. The Government intend to publish the full text of the Omnibus Bill on 22 February, and to work closely with all Members of the Oireachtas so that it will be enacted by 29 March.</p>  <p>  For my own Department, I am proposing legislation in three areas. These seek to ensure continuity for business and citizens in relation to access to certain taxation reliefs and allowances in income tax, capital tax, corporation tax and stamp duty, the retention of a number of anti-avoidance provisions and allow for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT in order to alleviate cash flow impacts for business, as well as amendments which will cover continuity for the settlement of trading in Irish equities and contract continuity for Irish insurance policyholders.</p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland is also continuing to work on preparedness and contingency planning as part of the EU27 with the full support of the European Commission and other seriously affected Member States.</p>  <p>  The European Commission published a contingency action plan on 13 November 2018 and a further contingency communication on 19 December 2018. These contained guidance on Commission planning for Brexit and outlined their approach in key areas. The European Commission has tabled a number of  legal acts to be adopted in the context of its contingency planning for a no deal scenario. The Commission&rsquo;s contingency action plan emphasises that it stands ready to engage with the Member States that will be most affected by a no deal withdrawal and expressly states that &ldquo;the Commission will support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of the Brexit process, Ireland will remain in the EU with all the stability and certainty that membership brings. </p></reply>

The British Prime Minister expressed understanding of the concerns raised and underlined that "the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both" and the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship &ldquo;is absolutely central to the Agreement&rdquo;. Prime Minister May said that she has asked the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to &ldquo;review the issues around citizenship urgently to deliver a long term solution consistent with the letter and spirit&rdquo; of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  These are welcome commitments and acknowledgements by Prime Minister May. Last year, I raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the need for the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully taken account of in all relevant policy areas, and there has been ongoing engagement between our officials, including through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat. The Government will continue to engage with the UK Government as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement on this important issue.</p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland that is an integral part of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and which has been endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the UK Government, confirms the Union citizenship of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. As Union citizens, Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy the right to move and reside freely throughout the EU, benefitting from the important right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality while doing so. The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits&rdquo; that come with EU citizenship.</p>  <p>  Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure. The negotiations on the future relationship of the UK with the European Union will be an important factor in this regard. There is an onus on the UK Government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts in any scenario and it should ensure relevant issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its detailed position and pursued in the discussions on the EU-UK future relationship.</p>  <p>  The Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the UK that was agreed on 25 November last also includes important references with regard to cooperation between the European Union and the UK in relevant areas and it affirms the commitment of the Union and the UK that the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 Agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 Agreement.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the UK Government. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to proactively engage to ensure that people in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities, and benefits in to the future. Under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and UK Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the UK Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Although this measure was not commenced until 1 August 2018 by Ministerial Order, it applies to all qualifying transactions that took place on or after 1 January 2018.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of conditions that must be satisfied for the relief to apply.  There must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months of each other. Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty is chargeable only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold. A reduced rate of 1% is charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value. </p>  <p>  An important condition for the relief is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase (or an exchange of farmland) was made for farm consolidation purposes. The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Following the farm consolidation, a farmer must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming. Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Where land was purchased before land was sold, or both transactions took place on or after 1 January and  before 1 August 2018, and stamp duty at the rate of 6% was paid on the purchase value, eligible farmers may claim a refund from Revenue.  A refund claim is to be made on a self-assessment basis where the qualifying conditions for the relief are satisfied.  </p>  <p>  An amended stamp duty return should be filed through Revenue&rsquo;s online system (ROS) and the relief claimed on the return. Information on how to amend a return is contained on the Revenue website. Following the filing of the amended return, a refund claim should be made in writing to Revenue. The claim should set out the basis for the refund and include: </p>  <p>  - a certified copy of the deeds effecting the sale by the farmer and the purchase by the farmer; </p>  <p>  - a valid Teagasc certificate; and </p>  <p>  - a written declaration by the purchaser confirming that it is the intention of each person to retain ownership of his or her interest in the qualifying land and use the qualifying land for farming for a period of 5 years from the date on which the first claim for relief (including a refund claim) is made in respect of the qualifying land. </p>  <p>  The claim should quote the Document ID that is on the return.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.132.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400056#WRC02500"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that while I am very aware of the financial strain which the cost of insurance is placing upon some consumers and businesses, as Minister for Finance, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurers on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurers to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurers and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and requires adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurers on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016 that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also to  make it  more attractive for new entrants.  This Working Group, now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses. </p>  <p>  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Motor Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  The EL &amp;amp; PL Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, again to be carried out in agreed timeframes set out in an Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The recommendations from these two primary Reports are often inter-related and overall represent an important part of the broader insurance reform agenda.  Key recommendations in the two Reports seek to increase transparency in the sector, as well as to improve the personal injuries litigation framework and costs environment by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and reviewing the level of damages in personal injury cases.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations from the two Reports by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The seventh such update was published in November 2018 and shows that of the total number of 78 separate relevant deadlines within the Action Plans of the two Reports set up to the end of Q3 2018, 63 relate to actions which have been completed.  </p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its two Reports.  It is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations from both Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.16% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that premiums are still at a high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is expected that the next quarterly Progress Update will be completed by the end of this month and will concentrate in particular on outlining the definitive position in relation to all of the 33 recommendations from the Motor Report as the last of the deadlines within its Action Plan passed at the end of 2018.</p></reply>

As indicated during second stage of that Bill, my Department is considering our response to the report prepared for Social Finance Foundation on interest rate restrictions by the Centre for Co-operative Studies of University College Cork. While this report recommended that usurious interest rates be prohibited, this recommendation was conditional upon the credit union movement being able to serve the community which is currently serviced by moneylending firms, subject to adherence to prudent credit guidelines. A major policy concern is how to ensure that credit continues to be available to this community in the event that supply of credit by moneylenders is reduced because of an interest rate cap. </p><p>Furthermore, the Central Bank published a Consultation Paper () in March 2018 on its review of the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for customers of licensed moneylenders.  I understand that it expects to finalise and publish Regulations under Section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, to replace this Code in 2019.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, Revenue will repay some of the mineral oil tax paid by a qualifying road transport operator on diesel purchases when the diesel is purchased within the State and used in the course of business transport activities in qualifying motor vehicles.  </p>  <p>  The rebate under the scheme applies for qualifying applicants when the price of diesel reaches a certain level.  Currently, the quarterly diesel repayment rate is calculated using the national average purchase price. The Central Statistics Office provides this information.  The repayment rate is calculated on a sliding scale basis.  At present, there is no repayment when the price of diesel, including VAT, is at or below &euro;1.23 per litre.  The maximum amount repayable under the scheme at present is 7.5 cent per litre when the price including VAT, is &euro;1.54 per litre or over.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of only eight Member States that operates such a scheme and I am aware that there are different views on its merits. My Department's Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Tax Strategy Paper 2017 noted that the Diesel Rebate Scheme is a subsidy, or tax expenditure, and an ESRI study showed that the Scheme has encouraged greater consumption of diesel and this has had negative environmental consequences over the length of the scheme. The ESRI estimated that the added impact on emissions of CO2, NOX and PM10 is significant, with over 100,000 extra tonnes of CO2 emitted. I am also aware that the haulage sector wish for the terms of the scheme to be enhanced.       </p>  <p>  I made no change to the operation of this scheme in Budget 2019.  As with all taxation measures, the operation of the scheme is kept under review as part of the annual Budget process each year.</p></reply>

For the purpose of this answer, it is assumed that the Deputy means a &lsquo;soft border&rsquo; achieved by way of technological solutions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that there are currently no technological solutions in operation anywhere in the world that would solve the issues needed to avoid a hard border. Therefore there are no technological options that would provide the type of guarantee required to avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure and related checks and controls and to protect the integrity of the Single Market, post Brexit. In addition, the UK have not yet put forward technological options that would provide the types of satisfactory guarantees required to avoid a hard border and to protect the integrity of the Single Market, post Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that it is not preparing for a hard border in any circumstances and remains of the firm view that the best and only way to avoid a hard border and protect the peace process is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the EU and the UK. I am therefore advised by Revenue that in line with the Government approach they are not preparing for technological solutions for the border with Northern Ireland, post Brexit.</p>  <p>  In a no deal scenario, from 29 March 2019, the free circulation and movement of goods between EU Member States and the UK will end. Clearly, this will pose significant challenges for Ireland, for other EU Member States, and for the UK.</p>  <p>  The Government has indicated that in the event of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; exit, it will engage in intensive discussions with the EU Commission and our EU partners on the options available to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to protect the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.

Since the UK referendum, Brexit is an integral part of business planning in the Department of Finance and issues relating to Brexit are mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department. In this context, I meet and engage on an ongoing basis with my officials on issues linked to Brexit. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and coordinating closely with its agencies who are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. I recently met with the Chief Executive of the NTMA, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank. All are engaging closely in the overall whole- of- Government preparations, and are confident that they have put appropriate contingency measures in place to do everything possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, in the event of a no deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated. </p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant programme of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing and engagement across the country with the business community. Revenue have invested in scaling up its Customs ICT framework to deal with the anticipated increase in customs declarations and have accelerated and expanded their recruitment and training schedules to be ready for March 2019 and are on track to have over 400 additional staff in place by the end of March 2019. Revenue is working hard to support trade and businesses to be as prepared as possible and to deal with the outcome of unfolding developments through engagement with trade representative bodies, participation in and organization of events and seminars around the country and targeted correspondence to reach large and small traders across the country who do business with the UK. </p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit and the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong with significant holdings of cash.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Department and its relevant agencies are continuing  to work to ensure that they as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, post Brexit.</p></reply>

Importantly growth in the economy has become more broad based in recent years, with both domestic demand and net exports making positive contributions to growth. The latest data from the CSO shows that modified domestic demand increased by over 5 per cent on an annual basis in the first three quarters of 2018. </p>  <p>  Arguably, the best indication of the recovery in the economy has been in the labour market, with employment increasing by 3 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter of 2018. As a result there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before. In parallel, the unemployment rate has fallen a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 5.3 per cent in December 2018. </p>  <p>  As I outlined in Budget 2019, the economy is expected to continue to grow strongly over the coming years, with GDP forecast to grow by 4.2 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 2020. This in turn will be reflected in the labour market, with the creation of an additional 62,000 jobs in 2019. </p>  <p>  Despite this positive outlook, the risks to our economy are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the potential fallout from a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further escalation in trade protectionism or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy.  In addition, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime and rising geopolitical uncertainty all have the potential to undermine growth in the economy.</p>  <p>  As a number of these factors are beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. That is what this Government has done and will continue to do.</p></reply>

A key element of the Central Bank&rsquo;s role is ensuring that the consumer protection regulatory framework is fit for purpose and ensures that consumers best interests are protected. </p><p>The Central Bank's approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers in keeping with its remit and responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  This is achieved through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  </p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.  This statutory Code was first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. </p><p>Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  </p><p><b>Step 1:  </b>Communicate with borrower;</p><p><b>Step 2:  </b>Gather financial information;</p><p><b>Step 3:  </b>Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p><p><b>Step 4:  </b>Propose a resolution</p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  </p><p>Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrower and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  </p><p>As you will recall last year,  I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The key finding was that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  On foot of this review, the Central Bank also stated that although strategy, commercial decisions and contractual rights of regulated entities cannot be interfered with, they will investigate any patterns of behaviour it becomes aware of that suggests the CCMA is not being followed, and they will engage with industry on providing fuller information to borrowers on the assessment of their case in relation to arrangements being considered or not.</p><p>There are two other pieces of legislation that are relevant here.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. Under the 2015 Act, if the firm that bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.</p><p>Last year, the Government supported and assisted Deputy Michael McGrath's Private Members Bill, now the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2018 (the 2018 Act) which requires owners of loan books to be authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Specifically three activities, which were not regulated, are now regulated:</p><p>- holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, </p><p>- determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements; and </p><p>- maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio. </p><p>The 2018 Act gives owners of the legal title to credit 90 days from the commencement of the Act to apply for authorisation, i.e. by 21 April 2019. A loan owner must keep the existing authorised credit servicing firm in place until their application for authorisation is approved or refused.</p><p>The Government, along with the Central Bank, will continue to monitor and ensure that the consumer protection framework in place is applied appropriately.</p></reply>

Government is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future funding needs of SMEs, particularly in light of Brexit.  </p><p>In terms of monitoring the working capital and other requirements for SMEs, my Department biannually surveys the demand for credit by SMEs.  The latest Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2018, can be found at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i>The results of this survey show that working capital/cash flow requirements are provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 42% stating this is why they requested bank finance. When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 85% of working capital coming from this source (up 4%) since Sept. &lsquo;17. </p><p>A &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2018 and launched at end March 2018. The purpose of the Scheme is to provide short term working capital to assist Irish small businesses adapt and innovate in response to the challenges posed by Brexit.  Loans provided under the Scheme are between &euro;25,000 and &euro;1.5 million with a maximum interest rate of 4%, a meaningful reduction compared to the current cost of credit for SMEs. In addition, loans below &euro;500,000 do not require security.  The Scheme is offered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating finance providers, including Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank, a key objective of the SBCI is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  Due to state aid rules, the Scheme is not available to primary producers in the agriculture sector or to the fishing sector; however, it is open to food businesses.</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing fewer than ten people. Up to the end of Q3 2018, &euro;26.7m in loans have been approved, supporting 4,407 jobs.</p><p>The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office supports the appealer in more than 50% of cases.  </p><p>The Government remains committed to the Farming and SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish business have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

This communication sets out a roadmap which aims to start a debate around changing the system of voting for tax files from unanimity to qualified majority voting, QMV.</p>  <p>  The Commission roadmap identifies the "passerelle clause" as being the most feasible option for moving away from unanimity. This provides that the European Council could unanimously decide to move an entire policy area or part of a policy area from unanimity voting to QMV. The support of the European Parliament, as well as national parliaments, including D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, would also be required. This is a highly sensitive suggestion for many member states, including Ireland, as any move to change the voting method used for tax files would reduce member states' sovereignty.</p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the current unanimity based voting procedure is the most appropriate voting system in the area of taxation.  Indeed, over the last 4 years, over 21 Taxation initiatives have been agreed by Member States through this voting process.  This is an average of one initiative being agreed every 3 months.  This includes important Directives on VAT, administrative co-operation, Anti-Tax-Avoidance and also the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax sovereignty is an important issue for Irish citizens.  During the referendum on whether or not to adopt the Lisbon treaty a political commitment  was given by EU leaders to confirm that nothing in the Treaty impacted on Member States&rsquo; tax sovereignty. </p>  <p>  Given the large volume of important agreements reached at EU level on tax issues, I do not see the need for, or merits of, any proposals to move away from the requirement for unanimity.</p>  <p>  The issue was discussed at the ECOFIN meeting earlier this week.  While I was unable to attend the meeting personally, I understand that a significant number of my fellow Ministers made clear that their Governments do not support any proposed change to how tax decisions are made at European level.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the management of individual projects rests with the relevant sponsoring Department or Agency.  </p><p>We have examined all projects and programmes across government in order to meet the funding pressures accruing on the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital project.

The public works contract is a key component of the CWMF and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is to be used on all public works projects.  It is possible for public bodies to seek a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract from the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  This process has been availed of by sanctioning authorities for large or complex projects  or for those with specific requirements which do not naturally fit with the standard &lsquo;lump sum&rsquo; contracts.</p><p>It is important to note that a derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the Contracting Authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  It is a matter for the Contracting Authority and the Sanctioning Authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the Public Spending Code.  Accountability for the procurement strategy rests with the Contracting Authority.</p><p>Applications for derogations were received by the GCCC in relation to the following capital projects.<table><tr><th>Department/Public Body</th><th>Project</th></tr><tr><td>Dept. of Communication, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources/Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) </td><td>Energy performance contracting initiative (National Energy Service Framework (NESF))<br /><br />This is a template form of contract published by SEAI.  It is used in energy retrofit projects where the tenderer bids guaranteed energy savings that are delivered on foot of building fabric, heating and lighting upgrades which are funded up front by the contractor and paid back over a defined period by the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Dept. of Communication, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources</td><td>Use of NEC3 for remediation works at the disused mining site at Avoca, Co. Wicklow.<br /><br />This project used a target cost contract and was granted a derogation on the basis that it was not possible to define the extent of remediation works to the underground mine shafts prior to the award of the contract. </td></tr><tr><td>Dept. of Communication, Energy &amp;amp; Natural Resources/Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) </td><td>Use of the Local Energy Supply Contract (LESC) to finance, design, build, supply fuel, operate and maintain biomass heat and power systems and related projects.<br /><br />This is a specialist template contract developed by SEAI to engage energy supply companies for district heating and power schemes.  </td></tr><tr><td>An Post</td><td>GPO: Witness History 1916 Centenary Project<br /><br />This project used an amended form of the public works contract to facilitate the use of acceleration in recognition of the fixed completion date for this project to ensure it would be completed and open in advance of Easter 2016.</td></tr><tr><td>National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) </td><td>NPHDB on their Procurement Strategy. The contract was developed by NPHDB.  It is a bespoke form based on the standard form of public works contract for building works designed by the Employer amended to suit the 2 stage contract award. </td></tr><tr><td>Dept. of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; Marine</td><td>To use the standard FIDIC form of Contract for proposed dredging and reclamation works.<br /><br />A specialist form of contract developed specifically for dredging works that permits re-measurement of the dredged materials to reflect the varying costs of disposal associated with the different material removed in marine and estuary dredging projects. </td></tr><tr><td>Grangegorman Development Agency </td><td>FIDIC Design, Build and Operate (DBO) Gold Book Contract Approval for Grangegorman Energy Centre.<br /><br />There is no standard form of DBO contract published under the CWMF. </td></tr><tr><td>Transport infrastructure Ireland   (TII)</td><td>Use of NEC3 option C (Target Cost) contract for the upgrade works on the N8/N25/N40 Dunkettle interchange in Cork City.  This contract makes provision for early contractor engagement on design solutions and adopts a target cost in recognition of the possible variation in the price as the construction solution is finalised.</td></tr><tr><td>Office of Public Works (OPW)</td><td>Amendments to the Public Works Contracts for Building Works Designed by the Employer (PW-CF1 v2.0) for use on projects involving conservation, restoration and refurbishment works on heritage and other existing buildings.<br /><br />Amendments were undertaken to the standard form of public works contract to permit limited contingency sums for certain specialist works that cannot be fully defined in advance of the works commencing. </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>Use of NEC3 Option C &ndash; Target Cost with Activity Schedule for East Tip, Haulbowline Island Remediation Works (funded by the Dept. of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; Marine).  The target cost contract was adopted on this project in recognition of the uncertain ground conditions and the make-up of the waste material that was to be removed from the dump site adjacent to the former Irish Steel plant.</td></tr><tr><td>Transport infrastructure Ireland   (TII)</td><td>Metrolink &ndash; initial engagement with GCCC on TII's outline procurement strategy.

The Public Spending Code provides key principles as well as identifying a clear framework for the appraisal, planning and management of these capital projects. This includes the specification of the respective roles and responsibilities of the project Sponsoring Agency and project Sanctioning Authority. </p>  <p>  In terms of the National Broadband Plan (NBP), the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the designated Sponsoring Agency and is responsible for the proper appraisal, planning and management of the plan, including the tendering process for the State intervention network.</p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code, the Government is the Sanctioning Authority for the NBP. It is the Government which will be responsible for making a final decision on whether or not to proceed with the bid under the current tendering process, having considered, in due course, the recommendation of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, when Exchequer monies are being sought for capital projects, I consider proposals in terms of affordability, value for money, costs and the potential impact on existing capital allocations. </p>  <p>  In terms of information, my Department has been kept apprised on the NBP procurement process through meetings with officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (and their advisers as appropriate), submissions and presentations, as well as the submission of Cost Benefit Analysis Reports.</p>  <p>  The above engagements between my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have, naturally, included the issue of cost estimates and changes thereto.  My Department has conveyed its views on these estimates to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

In accordance with the Circular, pupils may be excluded from the test if in the view of the school principal they have a learning or physical disability which would prevent them from attempting the test, or in the case of pupils for whom English is a second language, that the pupil&rsquo;s proficiency in English is such that attempting the assessment would be inappropriate. In other words, the principal has discretion regarding exempting individual pupils from the assessments but would typically make that decision only where a sound educational reason exists.</p>  <p>  The rationale for using assessments is to gather good quality data about a pupil&rsquo;s progress, relative to other pupils at the same stage of learning. That information can be used to identify pupils who might need additional support for their learning, for example, pupils with learning difficulties or gifted pupils. The information which these tests provide is very valuable to the teacher who has a more informed understanding of the achievements of pupils in reading and mathematics and so can plan more effectively for teaching and learning. It is also useful at the whole-school level, where the school uses that information to set and monitor targets for improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy as part of the school self-evaluation process. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of assessment in supporting children&rsquo;s learning, parents are strongly encouraged to allow their children to participate in the assessment activities which are carried out by the school in accordance with the school&rsquo;s assessment policy. If a parent has concerns about his or her child&rsquo;s participation in assessment activities, including standardised tests, the parent and the school to discuss the issue. Ultimately, a parent may decide not to permit his or her child to participate in a given assessment activity.</p>  <p>  The Principal should point out to the parents in this case that while children in primary schools are not subject to State examination, assessment is an integral aspect of teaching and learning. Assessment is a necessary process used to identify specific areas of learning in which the student may require greater support or alternative learning and teaching approaches; and to assist the teacher in planning the next steps in the students&rsquo; learning. Standardised testing is one assessment tool used to build up a picture of a student&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. The outcomes of these tests are also intended to be used to inform decisions about teaching and learning in the classroom and the school in order to improve outcomes for children.  The school&rsquo;s policy on assessment which should be developed to outline the how, when and where of these assessment procedures should also be provided to the parents.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers within the education sector. For example, a teacher hired in September 2011 will see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the 24 September agreement.</p>  <p>  These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

All pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend school for the full day, unless exempted from doing so for exceptional circumstances, such as medical reasons.</p>  <p>  Reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioural management technique, or as a de facto suspension or expulsion nor does any provision exist for the use of reduced timetables for particular pupils or groups of pupils.</p>  <p>  Where children with emotional or behavioural difficulties, are enrolled, additional resources such as Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants, are provided to schools to support the inclusion of such pupils.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education also provides training and guidance to schools around the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs and including around the management of behaviours that challenge. </p>  <p>  Where schools apply a shorter school day in relation to a child, such arrangements should only be put in place in exceptional circumstances in order to assist a pupil to return to a school, where a pupil has been experiencing an absence due to a medical or behavioural related condition. </p>  <p>  Any such arrangement should be a transitionary arrangement, which is designed to assist the reintegration of a pupil to a school environment.</p>  <p>  In making any such arrangements, school authorities should be mindful of the best interests of the child and of the child's right to a full day in school. Schools should seek the advice of the National Educational Psychological Service before implementing such arrangements.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and TUSLA Educational Welfare Service on the matter of reduced timetables with a view to examining options which can be taken to address the issues raised.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more  extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p></reply>

The attached table sets out the position in respect of large-scale school building projects in excess of &euro;10m where the final account has been agreed. In summary, it shows that there was just over a 5% difference between the tender (contract) sum and the agreed final account for large-scale school building projects delivered since 2011.  There is a process in place for dealing with requests for change orders to existing contracts and these typically relate to matters such as unforeseen events during the construction process, requirement for additional works etc.  </p><p>My Department carefully manages and control costs on all projects in order to ensure best possible outcomes for the investment being made under the capital programme.</p><p>The measures in place to manage and control costs on large-scale school building projects include: </p><p>- Detailed procedures in place for appraisal, design, tender and construction of large-scale school building projects.  </p><p>- Standardisation of sizes and layouts for classrooms and other rooms in schools.  </p><p>- Detailed design team procedures that involve Department approval for progression through the various stages of design and tendering.  </p><p>- NDesign Team fees tendered on percentage basis and then locked in to a fixed sum when design has been developed at Stage 2A of design process. </p><p>- Planning permission and design completed before tender process commences which gives clarity to tenderers on scope of project  </p><p>- Contracts tendered on a fixed price basis using the standard form of Government contract &ndash; which gives certainty in relation to managing the impact of construction inflation.  </p><p>- Procedures in place for provision of monthly progress reports and arrangements for dealing with any requests for change orders to existing contracts.</p><p>In addition to the school projects listed in the attachment 20 schools were delivered during the period by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP).  In the case of such projects, the cost (which also includes Facilities Management and lifecycle costs) is determined at Financial Close and payment by the Department is by way of monthly Unitary Charges over the operational period, usually 25 years.  </p><p>Information in respect of capital projects in the Higher Education Sector with building contracts in excess of &euro;10m and with final accounts agreed will be forwarded separately to the Deputy when the relevant information is collated and finalised. </p></reply>

The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Coroner&rsquo;s Court.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, all deaths in custody are also subject to an independent investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The investigation by the Inspector of Prisons applies to prisoners who are in the custody of the Irish Prison Service, and includes those instances where the death of the prisoner has occurred outside the prison, or the prisoner in question was recently on temporary release at the time of death.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also has an internal review mechanism which assesses the circumstances of a death in custody, highlights accountability and outlines any actions to be taken in relation to the incident.  </p>  <p>  All prisoners on committal to prison, receive a comprehensive health assessment which includes a risk assessment for mental health issues.  Management interventions to ensure the prisoners safety including recommendations on accommodation within the prison, observation levels to be conducted on the prisoner, increased healthcare inputs, and any other specific measures that may be appropriate are implemented to reduce the risk in individual cases.  In such cases, further assessments are undertaken by the in-reach mental health services, and a multi-agency approach to deal with prisoners needs. Where appropriate, prisoners are kept under review by both the local healthcare team and the in-reach mental health specialists, and are reviewed at a weekly multi-agency meeting.</p></reply>

I have since received those responses and am setting out the position with regard to the pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the aim of the pilot red light camera monitoring system along the Red Luas line at the Blackhall Place/Benburb Street Junction was to reduce the number of road traffic collisions between trams and road vehicles caused by motorists breaking red lights at the junction. The project was established between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, National Transport Authority, Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ran between 4 June 2015 and 3 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality, I had no role in relation to this pilot project, beyond providing the necessary authorisation under section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act 2010. The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the pilot was to perform its statutory function in prosecuting offenders identified by the camera monitoring system. </p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that during the period the pilot was in operation, there were 1,300 detections. 737 of these detections were accepted and processed for prosecution, while 563 were rejected. Cyclists accounted for 73% of all rejections. Detections may also be rejected due to obscured/obstructed camera images, or in cases where the vehicle registration is not visible. 624 Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) were issued, of which 440 FCN amounts were paid (71%). </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Courts Service that its data is not recorded in such a way that allows for the compilation of statistics relating to this pilot. </p>  <p>  As per my previous replies to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions on the pilot, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not currently aware of plans to introduce similar red light camera monitoring systems at any other locations.</p>  <p>  I hope that this information will be of assistance to the Deputy. Given that the primary responsibility for projects of this nature lies with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Deputy may wish to address further queries relating to the Blackhall Place/Benburb Street Junction pilot to that agency.</p></reply>

With the exception of Dublin, the appointment of coroners is a matter for the local authority in whose area the coroner is to perform his or her duties. </p>  <p>  The coroner is a statutory officer exercising a quasi-judicial function and in relation to the conduct of their duties they are independent in the performance of their role.  The Deputy will appreciate therefore, that neither I, nor my Department, have any role in relation to the appraisal of the performance of a coroner in regard to their conduct of a death investigation. The coroner is, however, subject to judicial review in relation to the conduct of their functions.</p>  <p>  While there are no formal requirements in statute for coroners to engage in continuing professional development. The Coroners Society of Ireland holds training days for coroners throughout the year. The annual conference of the Society provides a platform for considerable exchange of views with experts and a significant learning agenda on matters of interest or concern to the coronial function. My Department is happy to support the annual conference and my officials will always attend where possible. </p>  <p>  Coroners are drawn from the medical or legal professions. In addition, the Law Society which represents Solicitors and the Bar Council which represents Barristers both require members to engage in a process of Continual Professional Development. Coroners who are doctors will also benefit from their ongoing involvement with relevant medical authorities.</p></reply>

Since his appointment, the current Director has undertaken a significant restructuring of the ODCE to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s needs in the context of both its strategic shift towards deploying resources towards more serious indications of wrongdoing and the increasingly complex environment within which the ODCE operates. </p><p>That restructuring has included the seeking of sanction for the recruitment of a substantial number of additional professional staff, and following receipt of sanction, the recruitment of eight accounting professionals (one of whom was promoted to Enforcement Portfolio Manager), two Enforcement Portfolio Managers, two Enforcement Lawyers and a Digital Forensics Specialist, together with significant investment in a digital forensics laboratory, training and development. The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the aforementioned vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.</p></reply>

However, the 2017 Annual Report of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) states that 234 complaints were received from members of the public in 2017. I understand that the compilation of the 2018 Annual Report is currently underway.</p><p>I am informed that in 2018 there were:</p><p>- 29 cautions issued</p><p>- 25 production orders issued (under the Companies Act 2014, the Criminal Justice (Theft &amp;amp; Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice Act 1994)</p><p>- 5 arrests and detentions of suspects</p><p>- 15 charges were directed by the DPP on indictment</p><p>The number of investigations per se does not represent the totality of the work of the ODCE; firstly because of the volume of liquidation cases and secondly because not all investigations result in a prosecution.  As will be seen from the ODCE&rsquo;s Annual Reports, complaints are not always relevant to the remit of the Office; where they are within the remit the matter is investigated.  It should be noted that not all investigations are of a criminal nature and the ODCE policy is to seek rectification of breaches in the first instance (where the matter is appropriate for such action).</p><p>The provisional figures for prosecutions initiated, convictions, disqualifications and restrictions of Directors for 2018 are set out in tabular form below:<table><tr><th>No of prosecutions initiated</th><th>Number of convictions</th><th>No of Director Disqualifications</th><th>No of Director Restrictions</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>31  <br /><br />(24 by Disqualification Undertaking; <br /><br />7 by Court Orders)</td><td>148<br /><br />(125 by Restriction Undertakings <br /><br />23 by Court Orders)</td></tr></table></p><p>As the above figures are provisional they are subject to change.</p><p>The ODCE also exercised its right to make certain compliance applications to the High Court under Section 371 of the Companies Act 1963, now Section 797 of the Companies Act 2014, to secure compliance with Orders sought. </p><p>However, it should be borne in mind that, working within the context of a rectification policy, many issues can be addressed by exercise of powers without the necessity of bringing issues to the Courts for determination, for example: production of registers; directing the holding of Annual General Meetings; production of minutes of meetings; and regularising breaches of the director loan provisions which, in 2017, secured the rectification on a non-statutory basis, of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014, in relation to Directors&rsquo; loans in 39 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;15.5m approximately.</p><p>The ODCE took a decision in recent years to concentrate its resources on more serious and complex investigations, the result of which is usually the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration, as opposed to a summary prosecution. </p><p>In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions (i.e. prosecutions of relatively minor offences in the District Court). </p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.  </p><p>Furthermore, since June 2015, company directors facing restriction or disqualification proceedings before the Courts, can avoid Court proceedings by voluntarily agreeing to be restricted or disqualified for certain periods.  This provision ensures that company directors, who are considered to be in breach of the Companies Act 2014 and facing restriction or disqualification proceedings, are dealt with in an efficient and effective administrative manner without the need for the involvement of the Courts.</p></reply>

In addition, the company intends to consolidate its operations and transfer its existing workforce from An Tula&iacute;, Baile na hAbhann to a larger new facility in the city on a phased basis. The company has stated that there will be no job losses involved and that all of the employees currently based in Baile na hAbhann will be able to transfer to the company's new facility in Galway City. HID Global are not in receipt of any funding from IDA Ireland in respect of their decision to establish a European Centre of Excellence and to transfer manufacturing to Galway City. </p>  <p>  I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, as part of its ongoing enterprise development strategy, has begun the task of seeking alternative clients for the facility in An Tula&iacute; and that the organisation is committed to further developing P&aacute;irc Ghn&oacute; na Tula&iacute; as a location for employment.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has a strong focus on regional development with 58% of all jobs outside Dublin at the end of 2018 and in that regard, Galway is an especially strong performer in terms of FDI.  There are 81 IDA client companies across the county employing 19,696 people, representing an increase of almost 8% over the previous year. Likewise, employment figures for 2018, published by an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in recent days, show that almost 3,000 people were employed in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies in the Galway Gaeltacht at year end - which represented the highest employment figures since 2000. This, along with the large increase in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s capital budget this year, is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to securing and nurturing employment in our Gaeltacht regions.</p></reply>

However, estimated expenditure across all mandates of the Health and Safety Authority can be subject to change where unexpected circumstances arise which might require a re-prioritisation of available funding.</p><p>In respect of 2019 the Health and Safety Authority has estimated an expenditure of approximately &euro;500,000 on specific agricultural sector initiatives throughout the year.  The Authority will monitor this budget and will adjust it accordingly where priority matters arise in the agriculture sector.</p><p>Overall workplace fatality figures show that 37 people were killed in work related accidents in 2018 which is a decline of 23% on 2017 and the lowest figure since the establishment of the Health and Safety Authority in 1989. </p><p>The farming sector, which has consistently been the most dangerous sector in which to work, had 15 work related deaths in 2018 compared to 25 in 2017, a decline of 40%. While this decline of 40% is very welcome, 15 fatalities is still very high for a sector that employs just 6% of the workforce. </p><p>The overall fatal accident rate of 1.6 deaths per 100,000 workers is also now at an all-time low. This fatality rate of 1.6 deaths per 100,000 workers is particularly significant given it was as high as 6.4 per 100,000 workers in the early 1990&rsquo;s. Due to the efforts of Government and the Health and Safety Authority along with employers, employees and key stakeholders there has been a huge improvement in health and safety standards since then. </p><p>However, with 37 people losing their lives in work related activity in 2018 there is clearly still more to be done. Against a backdrop of a thriving economy with thousands of new workers joining the workforce each month and challenges ahead such as Brexit and a skills shortage in certain sectors it is vital that worker health and safety stays on the priority list of all businesses.

Of the 12 ordinary members, three were to be appointed to represent the interests of the general public; three on the nomination of the Chairperson; two on the nomination of the Health Service Executive; one on the nomination of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin; one on the nomination of the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street; one on the nomination of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght; and one on the nomination of the Faculty of Paediatrics, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Children's Health Act 2018 includes provision to amend the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board  appointment process to better reflect the Board's primary role which is to deliver on the capital project, rather than its previous broader remit which also included operational planning for the services, the latter now being a matter for Children's Health Ireland.

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early this year. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment. Officials in my Department are currently examining options in relation to the operation and administration of this fund, which includes determining the access criteria that will apply. Once I have had the opportunity to review and approve these proposals, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. An applicant to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. Assets include cash assets and all forms of property whether situated in the State or not. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p>  <p>  - An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  - If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p>  <p>  - A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April.  </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.  </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.</p></reply>

The Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) procurement process agreed with the contractors requires the contractors to take all risk for quantities following completion of the GMP process, and limits their recovery of additional costs incurred by them to clearly defined scope changes and in excess of 4% inflation (as per the average of three published tender price indices) which may occur post July 2019.  </p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has also identified as a potential risk the industry-wide Sectoral Employment Order which was introduced in 2017. The independent review underway into the cost escalation associated with the new children's hospital construction project, as part of its Terms of Reference, will comment on the major residual risks and the robustness/completeness of the current forecasts and, where possible, quantify those risks contractually excluded from the GMP/adjusted contract sum. This review is expected to be completed by the end of March 2019. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  The NCPE competed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab will be reimbursed, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  Finally I wish to advise the Deputy that as Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion it would only be available in a hospital setting and not under the General Medical Services Scheme.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 imposed a range of adjustments to health contractor payments. These included different levels of reductions to various GP fees and allowances and the elimination of certain payments, resulting in savings of approximately &euro;120 million per annum. </p>  <p>  Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;525 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 now allows the setting and varying of contractor payments on a non-emergency statutory basis. It is my intention to put in place a new multiannual approach to fees in return for service improvements and contractual reforms based upon health policy considerations and engagement with representative bodies.</p>  <p>   Officials from my Department and the HSE are currently engaged in talks with the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the reform and modernisation of the GMS contract. Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. Of course, any agreement must benefit patients an provide value for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in a position to give further details while engagement between the parties is underway. </p></reply>

The introduction of an other organisation into the process at this stage would likely prolong and complicate negotiations and may make an agreed outcome less likely. </p>  <p>  Agreement on the delivery of a range of service improvements and contractual reforms has the potential to facilitate a very substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multi-annual basis. </p></reply>

Funding for the remediation project is currently provided to my Department, in accordance with the specific conditions set out by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an annual basis up to the completion date of the remediation works.</p>  <p>  The East Tip works are the most significant element of the remediation project.  In the period up to 2017 expenditure was focused on preparing for and securing the necessary planning and waste licence consents for the East Tip remediation and upgrading the island infrastructure in anticipation of works. Following the signing of contracts in July 2017, the remediation of the East Tip commenced and in December 2018 I visited the site to see that the works had been substantially completed. I understand that there are some minor finishing works on the site to be completed early this year. The access road leading into the site is also being upgraded and this is scheduled for completion by the end of April 2019.</p>  <p>  While the priority has been remediation of the East Tip, work on assessing a suitable solution for the former steelworks factory site has also been advanced in preparation for the next phase of the remediation project. Detailed site investigations have been undertaken and the preparation of an application for planning consent has also been advanced. The Government has decided that the Minister for Defence will be the ultimate owner of Haulbowline Island, in keeping with the main occupancy of the island being the headquarters for the Irish Naval Service.  Any remediation solution for these areas will need to be cognisant of their likely long term use.</p></reply>

Current prices stand at &euro;137.19/100kg, which is 0.8% below prices at the same time in 2018.</p>  <p>  The continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit lends an even greater urgency to the expansion of international market access, so, my Department and I have made a major push to encourage market diversification. In 2017 I visited Mexico, the fourth largest importer of chilled and frozen pork in the world and made access to that market a top priority. Following visits from Mexican authorities, six export plants were recently audited as part of the first stage of gaining access to the Mexican market for Irish pig meat exporters and we expect the outcome of those audits shortly.</p>  <p>  There has also been a significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to East Asia in general, with exports to China, Japan and South Korea totalling &euro;100m last year. In May of 2018 I lead a trade mission to China, visiting Beijing and Shanghai.  This visit included events, in association with Bord Bia, to promote Irish pork to further develop export opportunities .I also travelled to Japan and South Korea in 2017 to promote further opportunities for Irish producers in these markets. Exports to Japan increased by 36% to &euro;30m last year and exports to South Korea increased by 29% to reach &euro;11m. Additionally, I  led the first ever Irish agri-food trade mission to Malaysia last November, where I agreed a veterinary health certificate for pigmeat, an important milestone in the process of opening this market for Irish exporters.  I will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, capitalise upon opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.  </p>  <p>  As regards support for primary producers, TAMS II measures (under the 2014-2020 RDP plan) provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the pig sector to develop their businesses. A massive variety of items are available under the suite of TAMS measures and the Pig Sector is catered for under the current Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) of TAMS II. Additionally, in 2016 I established a Pig Implementation Strategy Group which oversees implementation of the measures recommended in the report of the Pig Industry Stakeholder Group. This group plays a vital facilitating role in achieving the objectives for the industry as laid out in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  I recently met with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the unique exposure the agri-food and fisheries sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including via traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s willingness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as a clearer picture emerges.</p></reply>

I was very pleased to receive a presentation on the Strategy from the Chair of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum at our meeting on 30 January.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is the first industry-led blueprint for the inshore fisheries sector.  I understand an inclusive approach was taken to identifying key issues and priorities for the sector, including a Steering Group with industry and State partners, a dedicated workshop and public consultation.  </p>  <p>  From the presentation given, I understand that the Strategy identifies a vision for the inshore sector, that it &ldquo;will have a prosperous and sustainable future delivered through a united industry with a strong and influential voice&rdquo;.  To achieve this, the Strategy sets out 14 objectives for the sector, which are grouped under four themes.  These objectives are linked to specific actions that will underpin the Strategy's implementation.</p>  <p>  Bord Iascaigh Mhara will lead the implementation of the Strategy in partnership with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum.  BIM will work closely with the Forum to prepare a plan for implementing the Strategy and identify the objectives and actions that will be prioritised.  The Strategy will frame the work of the Forum over the next number of years, until 2023, and affords an opportunity to target funding support available under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to where it can be most effectively used.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to launching the Strategy with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in the coming weeks and, in the medium term, to seeing the output achieved through the implementation of this Strategy.</p></reply>

Currently, there is no manufacturing of fertilisers in Ireland, resulting in indigenous fertiliser companies being price takers, dependent on global supply and demand, and subject to Euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies.  Fertilisers are mainly traded in US Dollars and are thereby subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) monitors the price of fertilisers on a monthly basis. My Department receives data on the type and quantity of fertilisers and lime sold on a quarterly basis from Industry.  The Central Statistics Office's 2018 Preliminary estimates of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture identifies an increase in volume of 7.3% combined with a price increase of fertilisers consumed on Irish farms.  This resulted in an increase of &euro;59.7m in overall expenditure on fertilisers, to a total of &euro;572.7m in 2018. </p>  <p>  I have long believed that the elimination of fertiliser tariffs and anti-dumping duties is something that could help farmers reduce their input costs. I have raised this issue at the Agri Fish Council since 2016, both with the Commission and in consultation with my Council colleagues.  At the Agri Fish Council in June 2017, I asked the Commission to address the significant overpricing of fertilisers in the EU brought about by the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports. </p>  <p>  In that context, the Commission undertook a study of the anti-dumping levy imposed on ammonium nitrate fertiliser imported from Russia during 2017 and 2018.  This study was supported by a number of European farming organisations, including the IFA.</p>  <p>  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1722 of 14 November 2018 outlines the findings of this review.  A total elimination of the levy was not supported in the findings. The decision was taken to reduce the levy by just over 30%. The reduction in levies applies to products with more than 28% ammonium nitrate.  In Ireland the level of ammonium nitrate is restricted to a nitrogen level of less than 28% and is used in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN).  While this product is not directly affected by the levy, changes in the price of ammonium nitrate may impact the price of CAN.</p></reply>

With 6,900 applicants in 2018 farming 466,000 ha, derogation farms have become a very significant intensive farming cohort over recent years, the area farmed under derogation having increased by 40% from 2014 to 2018.  In addition, Dairy cow numbers increased by c. 340,000 by 2018 compared to 2010; chemical N &amp;amp; P usage has increased by c. 10 % in 2017 and in 2018. </p>  <p>  Against this background, the environmental impact from the increased livestock numbers and fertiliser use has been highlighted recently by the EPA in terms of deterioration in river water quality and an increase in GHG agricultural emissions in 2017. Furthermore ammonia emission levels are increasing and exceeding the national emission threshold of 116 KT.  </p>  <p>  The increased environmental pressures highlight the need for additional engagement with intensive farmers. Consequently a review of the derogation conditions takes place this year in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), the Department with responsibility for the Nitrates regulations and under which the derogation is made available. </p>  <p>  An expert group has been established specifically for this task.  The Group is jointly chaired by DHPLG and DAFM and comprises senior scientific experts from DHPLG, DAFM, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Teagasc. This group will review and recommend opportunities for derogation farmers to increase their environmental contribution and sustainability credentials. </p>  <p>  To inform the review, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) will publish a consultation paper and invite submissions from interested parties and the public over a 6 week period in early Spring. </p>  <p>The recommendations of this review will be subsequently considered in the context of ensuring a sustainable derogation going forward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.602.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400066#WRN03900"><p>I am not aware of plans to extend alternative routes for businesses in Cork and Kerry nor am I aware of any plans to prevent travel through the UK.</p>  <p>  However, given Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on the UK as a landbridge for the transport of many of our exports and imports to and from continental markets, I am very concerned that in the context of Brexit this route may face congestion particularly at ports such as Dover and Calais. While such travel would not be prevented, it may become unviable for Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The landbridge is currently our fastest maritime route to continental Europe and is relied upon by many Irish exporters and importers, particularly for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Delays or congestion on this route as a result of Brexit may result in Irish businesses opting to instead transport goods on direct maritime or air routes to France and indeed to many other countries, if those goods are suitable for transport on such routes. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy has referred specifically referred to direct routes to France, I wish to point out that I met my French counterpart, Minister Elisabeth Borne, on Brexit matters in Dublin on 23 November 2018. At the meeting, I highlighted the importance of transport connectivity and Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the continued use of the UK landbridge post Brexit. We discussed also the potential implications for ports both in Ireland and in France given the levels of trade that both of our countries have with the UK. Minister Borne shared many of my concerns and said that France, like Ireland, was preparing for all scenarios, including facilitation of EU and Irish traffic at Calais.  </p>  <p>  However, I want to stress that the UK landbridge will remain a very important route for Irish businesses to access other markets. At official level, the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including officials from my own Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and others has been working closely with the European Commission and other affected Member States (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.</p>  <p>  A cross-departmental delegation of officials including from my Department also travelled to France in November of last year for meetings on Brexit preparedness. The need for French ports to facilitate the movement of Irish trucks transiting the UK was discussed. </p>  <p>  Irish officials also met with the European Commission for technical consultations on the landbridge in December 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with our French counterparts, other EU Member States and the European Commission in seeking to ensure that the landbridge can continue to be an effective route for our businesses trading with the rest of the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  Separately, a number of representatives from French ports have travelled to Ireland to meet with Irish port representatives on a number of occasions and most recently in January of this year. </p>  <p>  My Department has assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the landbridge.  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider, the preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019 and businesses throughout Ireland will be able to choose to transport goods on these routes. Furthermore, shipping services are market driven and ferry operators have in the past responded to economic developments and increased or decreased capacity in response to these developments.</p>  <p>  There have already been responses from the shipping Companies. CLdN launched a new 234m Ro-Ro freight ferry, the M.V. Celine, with a capacity of 8,000 lane metres on the Rotterdam-Zeebrugge-Dublin route in October 2017.  The Port of Cork saw the addition of a new route in May 2018 with Brittany Ferries&rsquo; commencing the service to Santander and Roscoff with the Connemara. Irish Ferries is deploying its new cruise ferry the W B Yeats on the Dublin-Cherbourg route. The Company has also ordered a second larger ship at the cost of &euro;165m for delivery in 2020 which will further increase its freight capacity.</p>  <p>  In relation to air routes, there is existing airfreight capacity from Ireland to other (non-UK) markets, although this means of transport is significantly more costly than transporting goods by sea. Airfreight tends to be used for the transport of high value, low volume goods.</p></reply>

As such these ports, and shipping services from these ports, will remain of crucial importance to Ireland in the event of a hard Brexit.    </p>  <p>  My Department has examined the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge.  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider, the preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department has also established that there is capacity in ports other than Dublin and Rosslare that could be of some assistance in the event of a hard Brexit.  The main spare capacity available in 2019 is in relation to Lift-on/ Lift -off (LO-LO), in particular at the ports of Waterford, Shannon Foynes, and Cork, and for bulk, rather than in respect of Roll-on / Roll-off traffic.  However, shipping services are market driven and I believe that ferry operators will respond to economic developments and increase or decrease capacity from particular ports in response to market developments.  There have already been responses from the shipping companies adding additional freight capacity on direct sailings to the continent, for example, the Port of Cork saw the addition of a new route in May 2018 with Brittany Ferries&rsquo; commencing the service to Santander and Roscoff with the Connemara, whose capacity is 27,414 GT.</p></reply>

The legislation is included in the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently under consideration by the Government.   Given the importance and priority status of the Government's Brexit legislation, it is not possible to confirm a specific date for the finalisation of this legislation, at this time.  In the meantime I am advised that, in order  to progress this important measure, TII is extending the motorway traffic control centre at Dublin Tunnel to cater for the additional workload from the introduction of VSL and is currently procuring the management systems and hardware for the operation and roll-out of VSL for the M50.  All the preparatory technical and logistical frameworks will need to be in place, by TII, before VSL can be introduced and become operational and as I have outlined, this work is on-going.  It is expected that the enabling works which TII is undertaking will be completed in late 2019 or early 2020.</p></reply>

The fund was envisaged to support the piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively fuelled technologies for Public Service Obligation (PSO) operations within the bus fleet and small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, as well as bridging the price differential between such technologies and conventionally fuelled vehicles.</p>  <p>  The role of the Green Public Transport Fund has, however, evolved in line with new policy commitments  and increased ambition. Under Project Ireland 2040 the Government has committed that from July 2019 onwards we will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet. In order to prepare for the implementation of this, the Fund is being deployed to undertake an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The trials commenced in December 2018, and the fuels and technologies being tested include full electric, diesel-electric hybrids, hydrogen and compressed natural gas. The trials will assess CO2 emissions, impact on air quality and the contribution potential towards sectoral renewable energy targets, as well as costs, vehicle availability and operational/infrastructural requirements. The trials are ongoing in Dublin and Cork, and it is expected that they will end in April 2019.</p>  <p>  The Fund has also been used to support the transition of the national SPSV fleet to alternative technologies through the establishment of a new Electric Vehicle SPSV Grant Scheme. Under this Scheme, which was launched in April 2018 and is administered by the National Transport Authority on behalf of my Department, a grant of up to &euro;7,000 or &euro;3,500 towards the purchase of a battery electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle respectively is available for vehicles in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector. By the end of December 2018, almost 50 vehicles had received this grant.</p>  <p>  In 2018, &euro;252,117 was drawn down from the Green Public Transport Fund for the eSPSV Grant Scheme, while &euro;166,298 was spent on the Low Emission Bus Trials &ndash; a total spend of &euro;418,415. The increased take-up under the eSPSV Grant Scheme as more suitable vehicle models came on the market and the scheme became better known in the later months of 2018, coupled with expected funding requirements of the Low Emission Bus Trials, means that a higher draw-down from the Green Public Transport Fund is expected this year.  To date in 2019 &euro;80,785 has been drawn down from the Fund.</p></reply>

I am not aware of any concerns arising from the manner in which that search was conducted that would be relevant to the National SAR Framework document. </p>  <p>  The Air Accident Investigation Unit&rsquo;s investigation into the causes of the accident continues and it is vital that they are given the time and space to complete their work. Their interim statement last March called for a review of oversight of Search and Rescue (SAR) aviation operations in Ireland. This was completed last September by independent international expertise (the AQE Report). A key recommendation in that report was to undertake a major review of the SAR Framework document. This is currently underway under the independent Chairmanship of Sir Alan Massey, ex CEO of the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency.  As the AQE Report explains, search and rescue oversight and regulation is a complex matter, and international regulation is still endeavouring to keep pace with practice on the ground. However in implementing its recommendations, and, particularly, this major review of the SAR Framework document, Ireland has an opportunity to make meaningful improvement to our current oversight structures, and in doing so set a benchmark for other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-14a.676.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021400068#WRP02400"><p>It should be noted that the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) is a two year pre-school programme. There is no routine provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child and may lead to breaching the statutory school starting age.</p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible so, therefore, an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have incorrectly believed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.</p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and a report was produced by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. A key finding of this report, which will be published in the near future, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child. </p>  <p>  The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). </p>  <p>  As regards the specific case you have raised, I would stress that each application for an exemption is considered on its own merits and never in the context of the outcome of any other case. In this instance, the application was declined on the basis that the full two year ECCE entitlement had already been availed of and with regard to the fact that the child named would be over age 6 years starting school. </p>  <p>  We will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019. The family should make immediate contact with their local school to make sure it has appropriate arrangements in place to support this child from September 2019.</p></reply>

The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;1.95 billion.</p>  <p>  Social insurance benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are not means tested payments but rather payments which are covered by PRSI contributions.  In any single jobseeker benefit payment week, the number of the days for which benefit is paid plus the number of days worked cannot exceed five.  Where a person is in receipt of a jobseekers benefit payment and obtain a single day's employment they lose a days payment for the day they work.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker's allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme.  Where a person or their spouse/partner has earnings from insurable employment, their earnings less PRSI contributions, pension contributions and trade union subscriptions are assessed as means.  A disregard of &euro;20 per day is applied, which can cover associated costs, to the earnings for each day worked subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week (3 days) and the balance of the employment income is assessed at 60%.  In any single jobseeker allowance payment week where a person has a single day of employment the disregard of &euro;20 for that day is applied and the balance of that day's earnings are assessed at 60%.  This amount is then deducted from that weeks payment.</p>  <p>  Both schemes are based on a day of employment or unemployment as the case may be.  This days based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are part-time workers or casually employed.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,190 per year and still retain a small jobseekers allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;34,700 if they are both working.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for the Department which is kept under review in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is clear that there are significant variances in their abilities to raise revenue locally and they therefore require appropriate levels of financial support.  </p>  <p>  The Needs and Resources Model was developed in 2000 to assist in the determination of a portion of the allocation of General Purpose Grants (GPGs) to local authorities from the Local Government Fund (LGF). The aim of the model was to bring about equalisation between local authorities over time so that each would have sufficient resources, from a combination of central grants and local income, to provide a reasonable level of services to their customers. The principle of equalisation has remained in the allocation mechanism from the days of the Needs and Resources model to the present. </p>  <p>  The model was used each year until 2007. A considerable amount of data was analysed to arrive at a proposed distribution, with up to 600 financial entries in each return. Local authorities provided detailed annual returns for the model and this action proved overly time consuming and cumbersome. The Model was first used to assist in determining a portion of the general purpose grant allocations from the LGF in 2000, based on detailed annual returns from local authorities, and was subsequently used each year until 2007.  </p>  <p>  From 2008 on, GPG allocations were determined, for the most part, on the basis of historic baseline supports with necessary year on year adjustments determined by the overall amount of funding available. In allocating GPGs, regard was given to each local authority&rsquo;s income and expenditure, the overall amount of funding available for allocation and the need to provide each local authority with a baseline allocation that would ensure its financial stability. </p>  <p>  Given the reduction in GPG allocations from a historic high of &euro;999m in 2008 to &euro;640.9m in 2013, the practice was to provide for an across the board adjustment and then some individual adjustments to take account of specific issues in the coming year. </p>  <p>  2014 was the final year of GPG allocations. The 2014 GPG allocations also recognised the move of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014. Accordingly, 2014 GPG allocations are not directly comparable to previous years.  </p>  <p>  2015 saw the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations being paid to local authorities. The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than it received from its GPG allocation in 2014. Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 took account of the historical GPG funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area. For 2017 onwards, the LPT baseline of each local authority was increased to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction income retained by local authorities in 2014. </p>  <p>  In May 2018, a Local Government Funding (Baseline) Review Group was established. The role of the group was to consider the methodology used to determine local authority funding baselines, so as to inform the distribution of any additional available funding for general, operational purposes. </p>  <p>  The review group was tasked with, insofar as possible, developing a methodology for distributing the available funding to bring greater balance and equity of funding outcomes for local authorities, in the context of the wide range of issues they face and the diverse nature of local authority areas across Ireland. </p>  <p>  The recommendations of the review group are currently under consideration. </p></reply>

Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  - A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.</p>  <p>  - The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.</p>  <p>  The most recent guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on the second phase of the Decade of Centenaries has emphasised the important role that local authorities and local community organisations can play in commemorating events of great local significance.  The Government, moreover, recognises the critical importance of local authorities both as important partners in delivery of the Decade of Centenaries programme and in promoting a deeper understanding of this sensitive and challenging period in our history.</p>  <p>  In this context, I have noted the initiative proposed for County Kerry. </p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - Meeting, on a regular basis, with client companies that will be most affected to discuss their business concerns  and support analysis of their markets and strategic developments. </p>  <p>  - Holding seminars for its client companies on the importance of preparing for Brexit and, in addition, participating in seminars and awareness sessions held by colleague organisations such as Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  - The introduction of the B&iacute; R&eacute;idh scheme which is similar to the Be Prepared scheme being operated by Enterprise Ireland.  This scheme provides support to companies to assess the potential impact of Brexit and to undertake market research to counteract its potential negative impact.</p>  <p>  - In recognition of, and in preparation for Brexit, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agreed a reciprocal Trade Office arrangement with the Scottish Chambers of Commerce at the end of 2018. This agreement will be signed early this year when dedicated reciprocal trade offices are established which will provide business support services to companies and facilitate investment and trade opportunities. The arrangement will act as a valuable resource for SMEs looking to expand their international business to business partnerships. </p>  <p>  - In line with the recommendations of the Department of Enterprise, Business and Innovation, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has carried out a new sensitivity analysis of its client companies' exposure to Brexit and is re-engaging with companies who score highly on this analysis and, in particular, with companies whose primary market is the UK.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta executives continue to engage with those companies considered to be at risk, in order to support them in their current strategic reviews as well as to offer support in the preparation and submission of applications for assistance in respect of innovation, efficiencies, market discovery and upskilling of employees. </p>  <p>  - In addition, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies continue to be updated on the other state support available by way of the Brexit Loan Scheme being provided by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I should also point out that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's Revised Estimates capital allocation has been increased by this Government from &euro;7m in 2018 to &euro;9.7m in 2019.  When the &euro;2.8m in funding allocated recently to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, as well as the &euro;2m in funding for P&aacute;irc na Mara in Cill Chiar&aacute;in allocated to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, is included, it results in significantly increased capital funding of &euro;14.5m being available to the organisation in 2019.</p></reply>
