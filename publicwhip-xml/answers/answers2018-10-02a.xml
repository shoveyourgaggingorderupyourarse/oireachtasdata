This is a five year programme of work being undertaken for the duration of the present D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  The Government publishes progress reports on the Programme for Government each year - the second of which was approved by cabinet in May 2018 and is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This report reflects the significant work undertaken by all Government Departments to deliver progress across a wide range of issues, including housing and homelessness, education, health and rural development.</p>  <p>  There is more work to be done. The Government remains committed to tackling challenges head on.</p>  <p>  The experience of the last two years means it is now reasonable to chart an ambitious path for the remaining three years of the current D&aacute;il&rsquo;s term. </p>  <p>  That path is about ensuring that &ndash; to the greatest extent possible &ndash; every citizen is enabled to achieve their full potential. We will continue to work towards improving access to our health services; increasing the supply of affordable housing; planning for Brexit; generating quality employment; driving justice and policing reform; continuing the gains that have been made in education; and much more besides.</p>  <p>  As regards specific commitments on defence policy, the Government is committed to building and maintaining defence capabilities into the future. Progress continues to be made across all fronts in relation to the defence-related commitments in the Programme for Government through, in the main, the White Paper on Defence.  Indeed, more than half of the 88 projects identified for implementation in the White Paper on Defence will have either commenced or been completed by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  These include efforts to increase serving strength levels within the Defence Forces - including increased female participation - and supports for veterans. A range of maintenance and equipment priorities are also being progressed and some &euro;35m worth of infrastructure projects are at various stages of implementation. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue its work over its lifetime to strengthen our economy and ensure that all citizens benefit from a fair society.</p></reply>

The Summit, which was chaired by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, was one of a series of such meetings relating to the Future of Europe. </p><p>On this occasion, our focus was on issues relating to migration, and internal security. We had a useful exchange on how best to progress our comprehensive approach to migration, as agreed in June. On internal security, we discussed a range of issues including the increasing complexity of cyber threats, including to the integrity of our electoral systems. </p><p>We also met in Article 50 format to review progress in the Brexit negotiations and to discuss next steps. I reiterated the need to ensure that the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK includes a legally operable backstop, to ensure there can be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland in any circumstances, and thanked partners for their ongoing strong support and solidarity on this.</p><p>Ongoing political engagement with our EU and international partners, remains crucial, in relation to Brexit and other important EU issues. I meet and speak regularly with my EU counterparts bilaterally, and at formal and informal meetings of the European Council, where I use every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests.</p><p>I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May in Salzburg where we discussed the Brexit negotiations as well as developments in relation to Northern Ireland. </p><p>I look forward to meeting my EU counterparts again later this month at the European Council in Brussels on 17 and 18 October.</p></reply>

There is significant work underway across Government departments and agencies on each of these areas, in particular through regular discussion of these matters at meetings of Government.</p>  <p>  Cabinet Committee D also provides a forum for strategic oversight of the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s overarching policy initiative to achieve balanced development and meet the infrastructure needs of our growing population.</p>  <p>  Under the two pillars of Project Ireland 2040 - the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan &ndash; four funds, totalling &euro;4 billion in investment, have been launched in the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action, and disruptive technologies. These funds will play a very important role in addressing the challenges identified in the National Planning Framework, such as the development of housing within the cities identified and the strengthening of our rural economies and communities. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040 was recently launched. It will work to ensure the optimal use and management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable homes.  </p>  <p>  Housing remains a central priority for the Government. While the indicators show that the numbers of new houses being built is up by more than a third compared to this time last year and is increasing month on month, we recognise that we are still facing a huge challenge in meeting demand.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the work in this area through Project Ireland 2040, we will continue to focus on increasing housing supply, tackling homelessness and increasing the availability of affordable and social housing through the delivery of Rebuilding Ireland and the additional policy measures announced by Minister Murphy to tackle these issues.</p>  <p>  Climate action objectives are also at the heart of Project Ireland 2040 and building on the National Mitigation Plan an investment of &euro;22 billion in Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding will be made to ensure a step change in climate action policy.  In this context, I together my colleagues, Ministers  Naughten, Creed, Murphy and  Ross, met with the Climate Change Advisory Council on Friday last to discuss the priorities from their 2018 Annual Report and recent statement to the Joint Oireachtas Committee.</p></reply>

I noted that the Report was launched just a few weeks after the Government published its Audiovisual Action Plan and that there was a great deal of shared vision between the Oireachtas Report and Government Plan. As I also mentioned, the Oireachtas Report was discussed at the second meeting of the Audiovisual industry steering group which met last week.</p><p>I have noted that one of the 11 Recommendations of the Oireachtas Report called &quot;<i>on the Irish Film Board to constitute the Board&rsquo;s Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry</i>.&quot;</p><p>Screen Ireland, which is the new name of the Irish Film Board, is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  Screen Ireland supports these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.</p><p>In addition to the discussions at the Audiovisual steering group officials from my Department have had discussions with Screen Ireland, on the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee around the issue of a Forum. Screen Ireland is giving consideration as to how best to give effect to this recommendation and a further announcement in this regard will be made shortly. The Deputy may be interested to know that I have also arranged to meet with Screen Ireland shortly and the issue of a Forum as proposed by the Oireachtas Committee will form part of our discussions.</p><p>I should just say that I am satisfied that the industry in general works to a high standards. My my Department will work with all partners to ensure that all sectors of the industry comply with their obligations and that everyone in the industry works in a respectful environment and supportive environment as that is the best way of ensuring the continued growth and success of the industry in the interests of all workers engaged within it.</p></reply>

I am glad to report that there has been strong interest in this competition.</p>  <p>  The interview process is ongoing and will be completed in the coming weeks. The Board of IMMA hope to be in a position to appoint a new Director shortly thereafter. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the interim Director Dr Moling Ryan for his on-going commitment to IMMA since last December. </p>  <p>  In the meantime IMMA has already launched a number of new exhibitions in 2018.  This has included a comprehensive retrospective of work by seminal British artist Frank Bowling and an exhibition of paintings by the Irish artist- Brian Maguire - arising from his visit to Syria in 2017.  Future exhibitions will include the work of Wolfgang Tillmans, a renowned German photographer and winner of the Turner Prize in 2000, as well as an exhibition of work by the important Irish artist Mary Swanzy.  </p>  <p>  IMMA&rsquo;s mission is to connect audiences and art, providing an extraordinary space in Ireland where contemporary life and contemporary art connect. It has a large and engaged audience which is young and digitally connected. An estimated 60% of its nearly 500,000 visitors in 2017 were under 44! In this regard IMMA has ambitious plans for the development of its facilities under Project 2040 including a dedicated on campus Collections and Learning Centre.  All of this provides both opportunities and challenges for the new Director at IMMA. </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to work with IMMA to ensure that its challenging mission is fulfilled.</p></reply>

The protection and preservation of our archaeological heritage, and the regulation of related activities, is currently provided for under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-2014. </p>  <p>  The original 1930 Act came into being in very different times and has been frequently and significantly altered in the meantime. The resulting complex legislative framework is no longer adequately reflective of, or responsive to, today's heritage conservation priorities or the economic, social and infrastructural requirements it now has to deal with. </p>  <p>  The new legislation will repeal the National Monuments Acts, 1930-2014 in their entirety and will create a modern consolidated legal framework designed to effectively meet the challenges of today's operating environment. I am keen to see the Bill progressing as quickly as possible and I am confident that it will provide a suitable basis for the protection of archaeological heritage that will be welcomed by stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  The Bill aims to simplify and clarify the law on protection of monuments.  It will replace several complex overlapping protection mechanisms with a single Register of Monuments that will have two possible levels of protection, the highest equating to national monument status. It will provide automatic protection for newly discovered archaeological sites while also ensuring appropriate consultation with landowners in regard to proposed new entries to the  Register of Monuments. It will replace the multiple forms of licenses and consents under existing Acts with an integrated licensing system for relevant works and other regulated activities. Clear criteria and procedures for dealing with license applications, including the social and economic impact of decisions to either grant or refuse a license, will be set out. A statutory right of appeal with respect to decisions on whether to grant a license will be introduced for the first time. It will also allow the State to ratify key international conventions in the area of heritage protection.</p>  <p>  The Bill represents an important measure of regulatory reform that will benefit all parties, including landowners, developers and heritage professionals, while at the same time enhancing protection of our archaeological heritage. Drafting of the Bill is now at an advanced stage. My Department is currently engaged in a consultation programme with relevant Government departments and state bodies which I expect to completed shortly. I then intend to introduce the Bill to the Oireachtas once Pre-Legislative Scrutiny has been completed by the relevant Business Committee.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased with the recent progress that has been achieved with the drafting of the new Bill, which is a very substantial body of work.  It will, when enacted, completely update and streamline our monuments legislation and provide an effective framework for meeting social and economic needs while also protecting our invaluable archaeological heritage. </p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018.

I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund in 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;75,000 was awarded under this fund to 4 projects in County Sligo. </p><p>Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and local authority websites.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes for 2018 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>In terms of future funding, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 </i>represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding for my Department over the next 10 years, as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that I work closely with Minister Murphy to promote the Arts and I recently joined with him and the Taoiseach to launch all 31 local authority Culture and Creativity Strategies which are jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>I understand that local government legislation has specific provision enabling local authorities to promote arts and culture within their functional area. While I appreciate that some groups have called for the law to be changed to make it a requirement for arts funding to be non-discretionary I am not convinced that this would actually make a difference to expenditure on the ground. All local authorities already make provision for expenditure in the arts. A mandatory provision would not change the level of funding provided as councillors would still continue to balance expenditure proposals across all local authority programmes as is currently the case. It is far better in my view for local authorities to embrace cultural and artistic provision because they see the transformative engagement which the arts and culture can bring to local communities. I think that the experience of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme and now the Creative Ireland Programme have been instrumental in raising awareness at local government level of the value of this engagement.</p><p>For my part I will work to improve the resources which flow to local authorities through the Arts Council and through the Creative Ireland Programme in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>The Taoiseach has declared his intention on more than once occasion that he is committed to doubling funding for arts, culture and sport over a seven year period. The Government is already delivering on this objective. Last April we launched <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage,</i>a 10 year capital plan which will support cultural infrastructure nationwide.</p><p>2019 Budget discussions are still underway, but I am happy to confirm that I have already increased funding for the sector in 2018, with the Arts Council receiving &euro;68m in funding from my Department in 2018, up &euro;8m in 2 years.</p><p>This funding supports the Arts Council's 10 year strategic  agreement with the County and City Management Association which underpins the close collaboration between the Arts Council and local government.</p><p>This engagement complements Pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland Programme, where local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement for of the Programme <i>entitled Enabling Creativity in Every Community throughout Ireland</i>.</p></reply>

I would like to acknowledge the very significant work completed by the Advisory Group over the past year in formulating its guidance to Government.  I am now considering the recommendations of the Group and I expect to bring a Memorandum for consideration by my Government colleagues shortly.  I am also convening a meeting of the All-Party Group on Commemorations on Thursday to discuss the approach to the coming period.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that it will be very important for the commemorative programme over the remainder of the Decade to adopt a broad focus, which acknowledges both the military activity as well as the many other dimensions that are interwoven with conflict, including its political, social and cultural impacts.  The State's approach will continue to encourage reflection about the multiple identities, traditions and perspectives that are part of the overall Irish historical experience.  We will ensure that this very complex period in our history is remembered appropriately, proportionally and with sensitivity.  To this end, I envisage that formal State ceremonial commemorations will be focused on the significant points on the historical timeline of the period.  Historical exploration, cultural engagement, community participation and artistic endeavours, will have a very important contribution in supporting the national conversation about these events and the local context.  </p>  <p>  One of the cornerstones of the State's approach to commemorations over the coming years will be to further reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain; to take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland; and to continue to recognise that very different perspectives persist on many of the events that took place.  </p>  <p>  I envisage that local authorities, our national cultural institutions, institutions of learning, and custodians of records, together with artists and creative communities, will continue to have a leading role in encouraging and supporting meaningful, respectful and authentic engagement over the remainder of the Decade. </p></reply>

I myself was very impressed in my role as Minister at the variety of events which I was able to attend including reading poetry in the Seanad Chamber, exploring artists studios in Temple Bar and experiencing the crowds attending the RT&Eacute; concert at the National Museum in Collins Barracks.</p>  <p>  In 2017, 43 locations towns and cities across the island of Ireland participated in Culture Night, holding over 3,000 events with an attendance of 439,919.  Events are run in partnership with local authorities. </p>  <p>  Events were also held throughout Northern Ireland and in Paris and Malta.</p>  <p>  Statistics are still being collated for 2018 but we are expecting over 4,000 events to have taken place.

I would expect the numbers in 2018 to have at least matched these figures. </p>  <p>  In 2018, Galway City received the maximum available funding of &euro;10,000 to assist with the cost of these events.  Galway County also received funding of &euro;9,500 for 2018.  This funding is provided on a matched funding basis through the local authority. There is detail on all this expenditure on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  I know that Galway has always been a place with a vibrant, active and devoted cultural community. Some of the innovative events in the Galway programme for 2018 included the Public Paint-in in Clifden,  the Ci&uacute;nas Project at the City Museum highlighting quiet spaces in the city, Blacksmithing at the Men's Shed in the city and storytelling at the Irish Workhouse Centre in Portumna.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department has also allocated a further &euro;322,000 to projects in the Galway area through my Department's Creative Ireland programme in 2017 and 2018 including Barbaro Children's Arts Festival, Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta  and for activities in Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support cultural activity in Galway in the coming years not least as part of the European City of Culture in 2020 to which my Department will contribute &euro;15m.</p></reply>

Strategic priorities of Culture Ireland include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, and the development of new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, by linking culture to the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in conjunction with other relevant Government Agencies. </p>  <p>  GB18, for example, is a yearlong Culture Ireland programme of Irish arts in Great Britain that aims to showcase Irish artistic excellence. Working in partnership with significant UK institutions, venues and festivals the aim is to build on the unique cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences.</p>  <p>  As Great Britain is a key market for Ireland in terms of tourism, trade and investment the GB18 programme is an innovative method of articulating our values at a time of change in Ireland's wider relationship with Britain.</p>  <p>  The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p>  <p>  Both Pillar 1 - 'Enabling the Creative Potential of Children' and Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community' of the Programme are experiencing considerable investment and the Creative Ireland Programme continues to highlight numerous events and initiatives of a cultural and heritage nature across the country helping to create vibrant and sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;3m (&euro;2m from my Department and &euro;1m from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government) has been allocated to all 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county. In addition, each local authorities have developed and published 5 year Culture and Creativity Strategies which were recently launched by myself, An Taoiseach and Minister Murphy. The Strategies aim to provide meaningful opportunities for citizens and local communities, together with our Local Authorities, to build and sustain our creative society. All of these strategies are available on the Creative Ireland website.</p>  <p>  In addition Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g took place for the first time on June 23rd. Each local authority hosted a day of youthful creativity that was specifically targeted at children and young people. Over 500 free events took place for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g nationwide to encourage children and young people to participate in creative activity which were very well received.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council is the main Irish Government agency for developing the arts. Funded by my Department, the Council works in partnership with and provides funding for arts, artists, arts organisations, public policy makers and others to build a central place for the arts in Irish life.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to work across Government to further enhance Ireland's cultural and artistic reputation, particularly in the context of the recently launched ten-year plan "Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027" which sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage.</p></reply>

This will be a formal ceremonial event which emphasises the enduring parliamentary tradition and continuing renewal of the democratic legacy. </p>  <p>  The Government's approach to the remembrance of the significant historical events and themes of the period from 1919 to 1923 will also be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations, chaired by Dr Maurice Manning, who will also attend the meeting on Thursday.  I am currently considering the recommendations of this Group in relation to the approach to the commemorative programme and I will shortly bring proposals to Government in this regard.</p>  <p>  The State's approach will continue to encourage reflection about the multiple identities, traditions and perspectives that are part of the overall Irish historical experience.  We will ensure that this very complex period in our history is remembered appropriately, proportionally and with sensitivity.  </p>  <p>  One of the cornerstones of the State's approach to commemorations over the coming years will be to further reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain; to take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland; and to continue to recognise that very different perspectives exist on many of the events that took place.  </p>  <p>  I envisage that local authorities, our national cultural institutions, institutions of learning, and custodians of records, together with artists and creative communities, will continue to have a leading role in encouraging and supporting meaningful, respectful and authentic engagement over the remainder of the Decade. </p></reply>

As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I greatly welcome the commitment given by an Taoiseach to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled by 2025. My Department and I continue to work with an Taoiseach and all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on this commitment.</p><p>A first and very significant step in the delivery process has been <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>which gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage to our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.

In 2018, total current funding  for my Department increased by &euro;11.5m or just under 5% to &euro;248.659m, including an additional &euro;2.8m for the Arts Council; an additional &euro;1.7m across all of the National Cultural Institutions; just under &euro;1m in additional funding for the Heritage programme and an extra &euro;1.4m for the 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language.</p><p>The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector. Budget Estimates 2019 are due to be presented on 9 October next and I can assure the Deputy of my ongoing commitment to achieving the best possible result for the arts and cultural sector within the parameters set out in the Summer Economic Statement and Mid Year Expenditure Report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

I am pleased to note that in 2018, my Department recruited five permanent ecologists to NPWS and three permanent staff for the National Parks including a Supervisor Guide, an Education Guide and a General Operative.  My Department recruits in the region of 70 seasonal staff each year to meet demand during the busy tourist season at the National Parks.

This year's National Famine Commemoration took place in UCC in May and featured the launch of the Irish Famine Online.  This powerful online resource was developed by UCC in collaboration with my Department and the NFCC.  The international Famine Commemoration will take place in Melbourne on 28th October, the second time that the international commemoration has taken place in Australia.</p>  <p>  At the Committee's  meeting on 26th September last I asked that the Committee would commence work on the preparation of a comprehensive programme leading up to the 175th Anniversary of the Famine.

In 2018, total current funding for my Department increased by &euro;11.5m or just under 5% to &euro;248.659m, including an additional &euro;2.8m for the Arts Council; an additional &euro;1.7m across all of the National Cultural Institutions; just under &euro;1m in additional funding for the Heritage programme and an extra &euro;1.4m for the 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language.</p><p>Budget Estimates 2019 are due to be presented on 9 October next and I can assure the Deputy of my ongoing commitment to achieving the best possible result for the arts and cultural sector within the parameters set out in the Summer Economic Statement and Mid Year Expenditure Report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;100,000 was provided in grant aid under this scheme for 28 projects in County Kildare. </p><p>In addition the Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. While I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund in 2018, over the course of 2017 and 2018, a total of &euro;119,000 was allocated to 5 projects in County Kildare. Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites.</p><p>In terms of future funding, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 </i>represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website <i>www.heritagecouncil.ie.</i></p></reply>

The aim of the works was to restore the buildings in a way that would have ensured that they reflected as closely as possible what they would have been like when they were occupied by the insurgents in 1916.  Each of the buildings has extensive original features, including plasterwork, partitions, staircases, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  Most significantly, they also contain physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents themselves in the form of the openings broken through from house to house during the final phase of the Rising. The intention was, and remains, to retain all of this original material.</p><p>Working with <i>The Moore Street Report &ndash; Securing History</i>as its guide, the Moore Street Advisory Group, of which the Deputy is a member and whose support for the process I greatly appreciate, is currently engaged in discussions with the owner of the Dublin Central site about the implementation of these recommendations and the future of the site which surrounds the national monument. I was pleased to have recently been informed by the chair of the Advisory Group that the discussions are progressing very positively. </p><p>I am also aware that the previous plans for the wider site are being significantly modified in a way that is seen to be more sympathetic to the traditions and history of the area and that also brings the commemoration of the events of Easter 1916 to the fore. Design changes in relation to aspects such as architectural heritage, urban regeneration, community benefit and social amenity will determine how the wider regeneration work interacts with the national monument buildings and how both elements are appropriately and sensitively integrated.  Until that discussion, in which I would see the Moore Street Advisory Group also having a role, is complete it would not be possible to put a precise timeframe on the resumption of work on the national monument project. The Government does, however, remain entirely committed to having the buildings conserved and open to the public as soon as possible.</p><p>In the meantime, the State owned buildings are being monitored and maintained by the Office of Public Works.  Works to stabilise the structures and to protect them from the weather were carried out before the Commemorative Centre contractor vacated the site. The buildings are now regularly visited and inspected by OPW which I understand is currently arranging for repairs to a minor leak to the rear of one of the buildings.  My officials and I are happy to accommodate the Deputy with briefing on this matter as progress is made.</p></reply>

The Committee's Report and the Audiovisual Action Plan have significant overlap and share the objectives of developing the Irish Audiovisual Industry and improving employment within it.  </p>  <p>  A steering group has been established to implement the Audiovisual Action Plan and has already met twice since the Action Plan was published.  The Group includes representatives of all Government Departments and State Agencies  that have an interest or involvement with the audiovisual industry.  As I said the Report of the Oireachtas Committee was discussed at the recent meeting of the Steering Group on 27 September. This included discussions regarding the importance of Section 481, compliance of the industry with aspects of tax and employment law, the holding of specific conferences and workshops to consider the development of the industry including the need for an appropriate forum to consider employment issues. Further work is being carried out on all these initiatives and announcements in relation to them will be made in due course.  The Steering Group will report to me at regular intervals.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific details supplied by the Deputy, it is important to note that employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.  Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to legislation being brought forward by my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  This legislation responds specifically to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  I am happy to report that the Bill completed Report and Final Stage in the D&aacute;il on 12th July 2018 and it is anticipated that it will be introduced in the Seanad this autumn.</p></reply>

I have allocated &euro;1.3m this year and 76 projects across the country have been approved for funding under the scheme.</p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures, designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m nationally for this Scheme in 2018 and 355 projects have been approved for funding. </p><p>Details of all of the projects awarded funding under both of these schemes in 2018 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites.</p><p>The closing date for the 2018 schemes has now passed.  My Department remains in contact with local authorities throughout the year, however, to ensure the best use of all funds under the schemes, including the reallocation of funds where, for example, projects do not proceed.</p><p>I have also provided funding of &euro;1m in 2018 for the Historic Towns Initiative, which is a joint initiative of my Department and the Heritage Council. This initiative is supporting six historic towns in 2018 who are carrying out significant heritage regeneration projects. </p><p>The best advice for owners in relation to individual historic structures is to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer in their local authority who is well placed to provide expert advice and assistance. </p><p>In terms of future funding, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 </i>represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

I am aware that this site, comprising a historic house and estate of some 5,000 acres, has been offered for sale, with a reported asking price in the region of &euro;28 million. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has no direct role in this sales process as it is a commercial matter between the owners of the property in question and the parties interested in the purchase.</p><p>Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country. Given the limited  resources available for capital investment within the National Parks and Nature Reserves, I recognise the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves' lands. </p><p>While the lands in question would represent a significant addition to the stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands, my Department could only consider acquiring this property if the price fell to within a certain range,<b></b>or in the context of a donation or bequest. This is known to the Vendors. In this context, I would also remind the House that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of just &euro;800,000.</p><p>Wicklow Mountains National Park and Glendalough are amongst our most beloved and popular heritage jewels. The Estate referred to in the details supplied has allowed a permissive access to a hugely popular walking route for many decades and I would hope that this would continue under any new ownership arrangements. While my Department has conveyed this desire directly to the vendors and their agent, I have no statutory function regarding the provision of access to private lands. Furthermore, the Estate has been an excellent neighbour to the National Park, working closely with it on habitat management and the promotion of our stunning Wicklow Mountains for tourism, film-making and amenity. It is my wish that this close co-operation would continue too in future.</p></reply>

Following a recent call for expressions of interest from the public through the Public Appointments Service,  I anticipate that I will shortly receive a shortlist of suitably qualified candidates from which I will be able to fill two of these vacancies on the Board of the NMI. The third vacancy on the Board of the NMI is for a staff representative.  A process is underway in the NMI, under Section 19 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, to identify a staff representative to fill this vacancy.</p>  <p>  There are two vacancies on the Board of the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork.  I intend that a process will be initiated shortly with the Public Appointments Service to identify a shortlist of suitably qualified candidates to fill these vacancies.</p>  <p>  There are three vacancies on the Board of Foras na Gaeilge, an Agency of the North/South Language Body, An Foras Teanga.

The upper limit of the managed navigation on the River Erne is currently just below Erne Bridge between Belturbet and Kilconny. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by Waterways Ireland that a number of studies have been undertaken since the late 1980&rsquo;s to examine the feasibility of extending the navigation upstream from Belturbet to Lough Oughter. The results of these studies have not been taken forward due to budgetary constraints, extent of assessments required, anticipated impacts on the designated habitat, constraints on works due to environmental legislation, and the remit of Waterways.</p>  <p>  There may however be potential in the waters of the Lough Oughter area being promoted as a distinct Blueway.  While I understand from Waterways Ireland that they have no plans to develop a Blueway in Lough Oughter, Blueways Ireland - a group that includes the National Trails Office, Canoeing Ireland and a range of other state bodies involved in, or with an interest in the development of Blueways - is currently considering the establishment of Blueways beyond the Waterways Ireland network of inland waterways.</p>  <p>  To this end, Waterways Ireland has met with the Chief Executive of Cavan County Council, Council officials and elected representatives concerning Blueways developed successfully on the Waterways Ireland network and to advise on possible ways forward.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is happy to support Cavan County Council with professional and expert advice should it decide to develop a Blueway on the River Erne from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra.</p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018. In addition the Structures at Risk Fund, with funding of &euro;1.3m in 2018, enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. </p><p>The closing date for the 2018 schemes has now passed and I am informed that no application has been submitted in respect of structures at Dun Laoghaire Harbour. Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites. The development of the harbour generally is not the type of investment contemplated by the initiatives  referred to earlier and such large utility and transport projects are best addressed by Departments resourced to  respond strategically.  </p><p>In terms of future funding, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 </i>represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

This was the second in a series of meetings that I will be holding with dialogue partners.  We discussed important social and economic issues facing Irish society as well as International issues.</p>  <p>  On 31 August 2017, I held a formal meeting under the structured dialogue process with representatives of the Catholic Church, led by Archbishop Eamon Martin.  A wide ranging discussion took place on a range of important national and international issues.  </p>  <p>  Some of the issues we discussed at these meetings were challenging.  They are issues on which people have deeply held views and which are matters of conscience.  Our discussions were valuable, not just because they dealt with important issues, but particularly because they were conducted in an atmosphere of respect for the views of others, where everyone sought to be constructive.</p>  <p>  Like  public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events.

Our candidature, for election in the Western Europe and Others Group, was first announced in 2005.  We are one of three candidates for the two available seats in this group, at an election in June 2020.  The other two candidates are Canada and Norway.</p>  <p>  Along with colleagues across Cabinet, I am taking every opportunity to raise our candidature with representatives of Member States and to convince them of the value of Ireland taking our place and playing our part on the Security Council.</p>  <p>  In making Ireland&rsquo;s case, we are highlighting our principled commitment to the value of multilateralism and the importance of the issues being addressed by the global community in relation to peace and security.</p>  <p>  Across Government and across Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, we are highlighting our consistent approach at the UN over more than six decades of membership, including our support for and involvement in disarmament, human rights, sustainable development, humanitarian action and peacekeeping.</p>  <p>  If Ireland were elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council our fundamental approach across all agenda items would always be to advocate for and support decisions and policies based on the core values of our foreign policy-justice, equality, peace and security and sustainability. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s campaign was officially launched in July 2018 at an event at the UN Headquarters in New York. Such launches are an expected part of campaigns for election to the Security Council.</p>  <p>  Just last week, Ireland took the opportunity of the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly High Level Week to further promote our candidature in New York to the wide and diverse membership of the UN. During that high level week at the United Nations, An Taoiseach, Minister of State Cannon and I met with a large number of Heads of State and Government and Ministers and received a strong hearing on our campaign principles of Empathy, Partnership and Independence. </p>  <p>  Following the successful co facilitation of the Mandela Peace Summit Declaration by Ireland and South Africa, the Taoiseach addressed the Mandela Peace Summit. Ireland was honoured to be asked to co facilitate the work on the declaration with South Africa.</p>  <p>  Throughout the week, my colleagues and I attended a number of events on themes of disarmament; women, peace and security; and climate justice. I reiterated the firm support of Ireland for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNWRA) and our increased financial support for that vital agency. I deposited Ireland&rsquo;s instrument of ratification of the Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the Crime of Aggression, agreed in Kampala, with the UN Secretary General. I reconfirmed our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income for Official Development Assistance by 2030. I committed Ireland to increasing our overall investment in education to a minimum of &euro;250 million over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Through all of these interactions, and the extensive range of meetings which will take place over the coming 20 months, UN Member States will be very aware that Ireland will continue our strong efforts for election to the Security Council with the 192 other UN Member States.</p></reply>

Amongst other things, it committed the Government to publishing a White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s International Development Cooperation and to delivering 0.7% of GNI to Overseas Development Assistance by 2030.</p>  <p>  At the United Nations General Assembly last week the T&aacute;naiste reaffirmed this commitment.  At a side event, the T&aacute;naiste pledged that as part of this scaling up Ireland would increase its contribution to education by &euro;75 million (44%) over the next five years. </p>  <p>  While at the United Nations last week, the T&aacute;naiste and I had tens of meetings daily, with senior UN officials, with representatives of Irish Aid recipient countries, and with other key influencers, as well as actively participating in policy debates on a wide range of issues pertinent to Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation.  In addition, a considerable number of official level meetings also took place on development cooperation themes.</p>  <p>  Among the important and diverse issues raised in the New York meetings were the situation in Palestine and Syria; addressing communicable diseases such as TB; women, peace and security; education in conflict; and climate and sustainable development.  Ireland&rsquo;s role as the chair of the OCHA donor support group provided a context for some of these discussions.</p>  <p>  A central theme in meetings was the importance Ireland attaches to a well-functioning multilateral system and for the rules-based system.  </p>  <p>  The new international development policy, to be published before the end of this year, will inform how Ireland&rsquo;s official aid programme will continue to support multilateralism in the years ahead, particularly in the context of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.  There was keen interest among partners in New York in the public consultation process on the new policy, not least as many UN agencies contributed to the written consultation.</p></reply>

In particular, Ireland supports the previously mentioned EU regulation on conflict minerals.  This area is led on by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in coordination with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p>  <p>  The suggestion of sanctions on Israel has been made many times by the Deputy and others, and discussed here in the House. Restrictions on trade would have to be imposed at EU or UN level.  The Government does not support the imposition of sanctions on Israel, and such a proposal would have no possibility of reaching agreement at EU level. I have no proposals for a different approach in relation to diamonds.</p>  <p>  Similar to Israel, restrictions on trade with Zimbabwe would have to be imposed at EU or UN level. Notwithstanding the violence that took place there on 1 August 2018, in which civilians died in clashes between protestors and the military, there is no proposal to restrict trade with Zimbabwe. Ireland supported the EU statement issued following the election, condemning the violence, and welcoming President Mnangawa&rsquo;s announcement of a commission of inquiry into those events. </p>  <p>  Openness and transparency, and a commitment to justice and equality, are essential to building trust within any divided community. My Department continues to monitor developments closely through the Embassy in Pretoria, who visit and engage regularly with officials in Zimbabwe, and through our engagement with the EU.</p></reply>

I note that while the UN Security Council has discussed the situation, and has visited Myanmar in May of this year, no resolution to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court has been tabled.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will no doubt agree, the findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFM) make for harrowing reading.  The report corroborates many of the eyewitness accounts which have emerged from Myanmar in recent times.  It provides credible findings that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States.  These crimes include the widespread killing of civilians; rape and sexual violence; torture and enforced disappearances.</p>  <p>  The IIFFM&rsquo;s report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of the crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. </p>  <p>  Having considered this evidence, Ireland would support the referral by the Security Council of the situation in Myanmar to the ICC.  The Security Council is the only competent body that can take this step.</p>  <p>  However, given the political and legal difficulties that surround such a referral, our focus in ensuring accountability and investigation of the allegations is necessarily elsewhere.  We are working closely with international partners in other fora including the UN Human Rights Council and the EU to ensure that measures are put in place to allow the investigation of  human rights violations and that those who have perpetrated these crimes are held to account. </p>  <p>  In particular, at the current session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland has worked closely with the EU and other international partners in support of a resolution which was adopted on 27 September to establish an effective accountability mechanism to hold responsible those who have committed human rights violations in relation to the Rohingya people.</p></reply>

In 2018 these have taken place to raise awareness of the Online Passport Renewals Service, a &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; initiative and Ireland&rsquo;s bid for membership of the UN Security Council in 2021-22. A recently-announced public information campaign to promote awareness of Government-wide supports and resources that are available to assist with Brexit preparedness is also being coordinated by my Department. Details of each of these campaigns are as follows:</p><p><b>Online Passport Renewals Service </b></p><p>My Department makes every effort to promote good practices by Irish citizens who may be planning to travel abroad. So far in 2018 we have concentrated on highlighting the Online Passport Renewal Service as a fast and secure way for adults to renew their passports. Specific activities have included advertisements in local publications throughout the country and on social media platforms, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations. The direct costs of advertising to raise public awareness in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p><b><font color="#2F2F2F">Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe </font></b></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Against the background of debate which is underway at EU level and beyond about how best to address the challenges of a rapidly changing the world, and in cooperation with European Movement Ireland, my Department hosted a series of &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; events throughout spring 2018. These events took place in Galway, Cork, Donegal, Kildare, Meath and Dublin and enabled citizens to share ideas and priorities on the future of Europe and on such themes as the economy, security, social responsibility and globalisation.</font></p><p>To raise awareness of these opportunities for the citizens to engage and attend these events, my Department undertook a communications campaign that included advertisements in local papers and on local radio in each of the locations concerned. The direct costs of this advertising are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p><b>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council </b></p><p>On July 2<sup>nd</sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence.  To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in the table.</p><p><b>The Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;</b></p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep the Irish public fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. </p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>My Department is also coordinating a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.  This campaign will update citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as public workshop events which are to be held over successive weeks throughout October. A programme of awareness raising via web and social media platforms and radio and print media advertising has begun but remains at an early stage and associated costs have yet to be incurred.  </p><p><b>Table: Online Advertising and Public Awareness Campaigns Expenditure 2018</b></p><p>[Note: In the time available it has not proved possible to break down these amounts on a monthly basis.]<table><tr><th>Campaign / Theme</th><th>Supplier</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals<br /><br />(March 2018-June 2018)</td><td>Mediavest</td><td>&euro;40,538.65</td></tr><tr><td>Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe -<br /><br />(Feb - May 2018)</td><td>Topic Media, Celtic, Media, Highland Radio, Connacht Tribune, River Media, Irish Examiner, LMFM Radio &amp;amp; Galway Advertiser</td><td>&euro;6,473</td></tr><tr><td>UN Security Council Campaign<br /><br />July 2018</td><td>Twitter and Facebook</td><td>&euro;461</td></tr><tr><td>Government Brexit Update <br /><br />(Jan 2018 &ndash; to date)</td><td>Twitter and MailChimp</td><td>&euro;1,211.00</td></tr><tr><td>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready <br /><br />(20 Sept 2018 &ndash; to date)</td><td>PhD Media / TBWA</td><td>Invoices awaited</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As in all other areas of the EU-UK negotiations, the operation of EU law will need to be respected. </p>  <p>  The Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, are protected for people on the island of Ireland, North and South.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government appreciates the solidarity and support which has been shown by all of our EU partners in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns.</p>  <p>  On 8 December last, a Joint Report between the EU and UK negotiators was agreed, and this included important commitments in respect of the avoidance of a hard border on the island and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including in respect of North/South cooperation and the provisions on citizenship and fundamental rights.  </p>  <p>  In paragraph 52 of the Joint Report, the European Commission and the UK acknowledged that the Good Friday Agreement recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to choose to be Irish or British or both and be accepted as such.  The Joint Report also confirms that the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in Northern Ireland.  Both parties agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement should respect and be without prejudice to the rights, opportunities, and identity that come with European Union citizenship for such people, and that the next phase of negotiations would examine arrangements required to give effect to the ongoing exercise of, and access to, their EU rights, opportunities and benefits. </p>  <p>  This position is recognised in the draft Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland that is part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. </p>  <p>  Discussions on the rights of individuals also remain ongoing as part of the Phase 2 negotiations on issues related to Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure.</p>  <p>  As the UK leaves the European Union, there is an onus on its Government to ensure that it provides as necessary for the recognition in the Joint Report that the people of Northern Ireland who choose to identify as Irish, and therefore as citizens of the EU, can continue to enjoy the rights, opportunities and benefits of EU citizenship, including where they reside in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  At the same time, there is an obligation on the UK Government under the Good Friday Agreement to uphold the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage intensively to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to secure the gains of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s negotiating approach remains as set out in the European Council Guidelines of April 2017 and March 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government has been consistently clear that Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, in order to minimise the impact on our trade and economy.  At the same time, it is vital to our economic interests that the EU's Single Market and Customs Union are fully protected.    </p>  <p>  The Government acknowledged in June that the Chequers/White Paper proposals represented a useful contribution, but that much detailed analysis and discussion was required.</p>  <p>  As reported by the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, at the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 18 September, in early discussions there has been a convergence of views in some areas, notably on future EU-UK cooperation on foreign policy and security, both internal and external.  However, it is also clear that there are very substantial differences, in particular relating to the proposed future economic partnership.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, stated in Salzburg last week that the proposals on the future economic partnership will not work, not least because they risk undermining the Single Market.</p>  <p>  It is now for the two sets of negotiators to take forward their work on the framework for the future relationship taking account of their respective positions.  At the same time, it remains essential, as underlined at Salzburg, that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, is also concluded as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This amount included such items as plot rental, design and construction of the stand and necessary health and safety facilities for visitors.  Certain elements of this amount were incurred due to the additional fourth day on which the 2018 Championships took place. </p>  <p>  My Department was represented at the Championships by 36 members of staff serving in rotation over the 4 days in question, with the bulk of these doing so in a volunteer capacity from their regular duties.  Costs involved, including for local accommodation and transport requirements, amounted to &euro;19,252.20.  Certain elements of this expenditure likewise arose due to the additional fourth day on which the 2018 Championships took place.</p></reply>

Revenue currently has over 2,000 operational staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance including activities related to anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection and recovery.</p>  <p>  Revenue expect that they will require an additional 600 staff because of Brexit, based on a scenario of a transition period after March 2019 and a future trade agreement between the EU and UK.  A recruitment campaign has commenced with a view to having an additional 200 officers trained and in place before 29 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in relation to the operation of customs procedures for the movement of goods, a key objective for them is to facilitate legitimate trade to move as speedily and efficiently as possible.  In that context and having regard to the provisions of the Union Customs Code, Revenue encourages businesses to avail fully of relevant simplifications and procedures available under the Code.  The Code, which came into operation from 1 May 2016, aims to, inter alia, allows traders to clear customs procedures more simply and quickly, getting goods to consumers faster and more cheaply. </p>  <p>  The level of import checks reflects the use of electronic risk analysis for declarations lodged in advance of the arrival of goods and is supported by post-clearance checks, including customs audits, which are carried out at traders' premises.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in 2017, 92% of import declarations received a Green routing and immediate release from Customs.  6% of import declarations were routed Orange and subjected to documentary checks while 2% received a Red routing and required to be physically examined.  Revenue advise me that there are a number of different IT systems used by Customs officials to deliver on Revenue&rsquo;s objective to facilitate legitimate trade to move as speedily and efficiently as possible and to monitor and control, on a risk focused basis, goods imported from outside the EU.  The capacity of these systems has been significantly increased in order to deal with the expected growth in the number of transactions post Brexit.  Performance testing of the systems is ongoing and will be completed in advance of 29  March 2019.  The total investment to date is &euro;1.32m which covers the cost of additional servers and the required development, tuning and testing of existing functionality.</p>  <p>  The research referenced about imports to Northern Ireland via Dublin port is based on a survey conducted by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.  I am advised by Revenue that it is likely that the clear majority of goods arriving into Dublin Port and subsequently transferred to Northern Ireland are from another EU Member State.  As a result, the level of information collected through trader returns, and therefore the data available for analysis, is limited.  In respect of third country trade detailed returns (&ldquo;SADS&rdquo;) are required and for intra-EU trade a customs declaration is not required.  Revenue does collect information in relation to intra-EU trade via the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) but this does not record detailed information of the consignment or final recipient that would be required to conduct comparable analysis for ports in the Republic.</p></reply>

I am further advised that there has been no change in the position in relation to the VAT treatment of cookery schools. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the VAT Directive, the provision of children&rsquo;s or young people&rsquo;s education and school or university education is exempt from VAT. This exemption also applies to the provision of training and development courses subject to the training and retraining being of a vocational nature. Where a cookery school is providing courses for educational or vocational purposes, any such course is exempt from VAT, provided the lessons in question are conducted as part of a programme that meets the standards set out by the Department of Education and Skills syllabus or, in the case of vocational training, the course is aimed at acquiring or updating knowledge in relation to a specific profession or trade. </p>  <p>  Where a cookery school provides courses primarily for recreational purposes, the position continues to be that these courses are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. A course which is primarily for recreational purposes is undertaken for the enjoyment and satisfaction of the participants rather than for developing skills and knowledge which will assist the participant in their trade or profession, and is therefore outside the scope of the education exemption. </p>  <p>  When a business operates two activities, such as a restaurant which operates a cookery school, the tax rate applicable to the income derived from each activity is dependent on the actual supplies being made. In general, restaurant services are taxable at the 9% reduced rate and cookery courses are either exempt or taxable at the standard rate of 23%. If a cookery school has any doubt as to the eligibility for exemption of any of its courses, it should contact its local Revenue District for advice.</p></reply>

However, they have provided the following general information in relation to the administration and review of claims for the film tax credit under Section 481, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>  <p>  Under Section 481, in general terms a company which produces a film can claim a payable tax credit of 32% of the lower of: </p>  <p>  (a) the eligible expenditure incurred on producing a film, </p>  <p>  (b) 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or</p>  <p>  (c) &euro;70 million per film.</p>  <p>  The maximum credit a company can claim in respect of a film is therefore &euro;22.4million.</p>  <p>  Eligible expenditure is the amount that the producer company spends in Ireland, wholly and exclusively on producing the film.  Amounts spent on the film outside of Ireland do not qualify for the tax credit.  However, where the credit is calculated based on 80% of the total cost of production, Revenue must have regard to the amounts incurred outside of the State as an increased global budget can lead to an increased credit.</p>  <p>  The company that claims the credit must be an Irish producer company.  The Irish work on the film must be carried out by a special purpose company which is wholly owned by that Irish producer company.  Where the film is not a fully Irish production, for example it is a multi-jurisdictional production or a co-production, the Irish producer company will often organise the Irish production on behalf of an international production company.  In those cases, it is the international production company who has full knowledge of the global budget and of the make-up of the items in the Irish budget.  </p>  <p>  Recognising the potential risks presented, the administrative framework of the relief requires that a company&rsquo;s application for the credit must include: </p>  <p>  (a) an auditor&rsquo;s report detailing the eligible expenditure, the global budget and details of related party transactions, and</p>  <p>  (b) a solicitor&rsquo;s letter detailing that they have reviewed the legal agreements and that 68% of the funding has been lodged to the company&rsquo;s bank account (a requirement prior to Revenue releasing any amounts of the payable tax credit).</p>  <p>  The payable credit is available to a film that has been approved by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and which has been certified by Revenue.  Section 481 provides that Revenue may refuse to certify a film if they have reason to believe that the budget, or any part of the budget, is inflated.  They may also refuse to certify the film if they are not satisfied with the commercial rationale for the corporate structure used for financing, distribution and other similar activities.  As with all tax reliefs, the greatest risk of inflation is found in related party transactions including through corporate or financing structures that facilitate circular flows of cash. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the time taken to process applications for relief under Section 481 has increased in the last year, largely due to increased scrutiny on the expenses included within the &ldquo;eligible spend&rdquo; in 481 applications.  As the relief was restructured in 2015 from an investor-based relief to a corporation tax credit, the first films which have been made under this new format relief were being completed in 2017, which is when Revenue were first able to review the actual spend on completed films and the amounts being included in the claims for relief, as signed off upon by the auditors.  The largest adjustments arising from this review process are in respect of inflated related party expenditures, and discussions are ongoing between my Department, Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to options to protect the Exchequer and give greater clarity to producers claiming the credit.</p></reply>

That guidance is published in Tax and Duty Manual 08-03-05 and is available on the Revenue website via the following link: <i></i></p><p>The purpose of the withholding tax is to facilitate tax compliance by providing a mechanism through which tax arising on the interest earned by the person lending the amounts to the company is collected.  Where an individual makes a loan to a company, interest withholding will arise in respect of the interest element of loan repayments made by that company.  The interest earned should then be declared by the individual lender, who may claim a credit for the tax withheld.  </p><p>The provisions as described in the Tax and Duty Manual apply in situations where individuals make loans to companies in general, they are not specific to peer-to-peer lending platforms.</p><p>I am aware that representations have been made for differentiated treatment in respect of loans made via peer-to-peer lending platforms, in view of the multi-lender nature of loans via such platforms. However I would also note that peer-to-peer lending is as yet an unregulated activity in Ireland, and any consideration of withholding taxes will be informed also by broader policy considerations for the sector.</p></reply>

This approach is beneficial for the State because it nurtures competition which ensures value for money is maintained and provides SMEs with a platform to take advantage of similar opportunities in Ireland and across the European Union.   </p>  <p>  Specifically, the Office of Government Procurement have developed a suite of measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (circular 10/14). These include: </p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value); </p>  <p>  - Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; and</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal. </p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government.  This ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.  </p>  <p>  The OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participate at "Go-2-Tender" workshops and "Meet the Buyer" events held across the country which are designed to help SMEs. </p>  <p>  A SME Communication Strategy sub-group, chaired by the OGP, was established in 2017 as a joint venture with the industry representative bodies.  This further promotes awareness of potential opportunities and supports available for SMEs in tendering for public contracts.  A series of information videos explaining specific public procurement topics, along with case studies of SMEs who have won government contracts, was launched by Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan earlier this year.  A series of focused and targeted breakfast briefings have also taken place around the country in conjunction with Inter-Trade Ireland and the SME Advisory Group partners. Further events are planned.</p>  <p>  The OGP continues to proactively engage with business to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

For example, the National Economic Dialogue took place in Dublin Castle on 27-28th June 2018. The dialogue is an important part of the budgetary process and provided an opportunity to consider how to optimise available resources in the interests of all citizens and allowed discussion on how to best sustain and strengthen the recovery while taking account of the many competing economic and social priorities within the limited available resources. Representatives of community, voluntary and environmental groups as well as business, unions, research institutes and the academic community attended the event. </p>  <p>  Further to this, my Department has received numerous Pre-Budget Submissions from a wide range of groups and individuals. All of these are currently being considered by the relevant officials in the context of Budget preparation. However, as the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the details of measures which may be under consideration as part of the Budget in advance of the Budget day announcement. </p></reply>

Accordingly, my Department was asked by the HSE for assistance in determining the impact upon his pension entitlements of Section 52 subsections (6) and (7) of the <i>Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012</i>, which imposes a limit on the total amount of pensionable service which can be paid where an individual has been a member of more than one public service pension scheme.</p><p>The HSE was advised to calculate and pay pension benefits in this case based on service up until 28 July 2012. This advice was based on the fact that if the individual had total service greater than 40 years across all schemes at that point, the Act provides under Section 52(7) that he is entitled to receive that higher entitlement. </p><p>My Department is currently working on the preparation of new guidance on the implementation of Section 52 subsections (6) and (7) of the 2012 Act. In that context, I expect that the HSE will be in further contact with the individual in this case at the appropriate time. </p></reply>

For its initial report the Commission was asked to provide input on how the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation should proceed having regard to: </p>  <p>  - The evolution of pay trends in the public and private sectors, based on published data; </p>  <p>  - A comparison of pay rates for identifiable groups within the public service with prevailing non-public sector market rates; </p>  <p>  - International rates and comparisons where possible; and </p>  <p>  - The state of the national finances</p>  <p>  The Commission was also asked to give consideration to other conditions of service of public servants, including tenure and pension, as well as recruitment and retention trends in the public service.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Commission contributed to and gave informed considerations in relation to Public Service remuneration by Public Service employers and staff interests in negotiations on the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  The second report of the Public Service Pay Commission, published on the 4th of September, went further and investigated recruitment and retention difficulties in some of the specific areas previously identified, starting with the health sector. Where a difficulty was identified, the PSPC were to further examine the full range of causal factors, including, remuneration, planned future adjustments to remuneration under the PSSA, supply constraints on qualified staff, career structures, work environment, and HR practices etc.</p>  <p>  The main findings of the report were that there were no generalised recruitment and retention problems in respect of nursing and midwifery but some difficulties exist in meeting workforce requirements in specific areas, that training and promotion are the key influencers of migration and turnover in NCHDs and that there is a general difficulty in recruiting consultants, with certain specialities and locations experiencing more significant problems.</p>  <p>  There was a commitment between Public Service employers and staff representatives to meet within four weeks of the publication to discuss issues around implementation of recommendations outlined in the Report. </p>  <p>  Following these discussions it was decided that additional incentives recommended by the Commission (increase by 20% of existing Specialist Qualification and Location Allowances and extension of such allowances to Maternity Services on a similar basis and the eligibility requirements for Senior Staff Nurse /Midwife to be reduced to 17 years) would apply from 1 March 2019. These increases will be confined to parties covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission will next proceed to explore recruitment and retention issues impacting on other grades and sectors of the Public Service identified in its 2017 report with further modules to be completed over the coming months. </p></reply>

This approach is beneficial for the State because it nurtures competition which ensures value for money is maintained and provides SMEs with a platform to take advantage of similar opportunities in Ireland and across the European Union.   </p>  <p>  Individual accounting officers and accountable persons are responsible for procurement processes undertaken by their Department or public service body. Accordingly, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) does not collate the information requested by the Deputy as the expenditure data is, and will continue to be, held by the individual Government Departments and State Bodies that purchase goods, services and works.  However, it is estimated that in the order of &euro;12bn per annum is spent on goods, services and works. </p>  <p>  In relation to actions that have been developed to improve SME access to public procurement opportunities, the OGP has developed a suite of measures (circular 10/14) aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities. These include: </p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value); </p>  <p>  - Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots; </p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; </p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal. </p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, ensuring that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.  </p>  <p>  The OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participate at "Go-2-Tender" workshops and "Meet the Buyer" events held across the country which are designed to help SMEs. </p>  <p>  In relation to data on the number of contracts awarded to SMEs, the position is that the contract award templates do not capture the size of businesses that have been awarded contracts. However, the "Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2015" published on the OGP website indicates that the majority of spend analysed is with SMEs.  The analysis also indicates that 76% of tender notices are of smaller value (below OJEU threshold). The median contract value of 2015 tender notices is less than or equal to &euro;100k in 12 of the 16 procurement spend categories. This would indicate that government contracts in Ireland are accessible to SMEs given the low median size of published estimated contract values.</p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

Therefore, activity below these levels is not captured. </p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) will shortly be publishing the fourth <i>Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report </i>for 2016. Since 2013, these reports have analysed the tendering activity of the public service for both above and below the threshold for publication to the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU). The data analysed comes from the national electronic procurement tendering platform - eTenders.  </p><p>The table below includes tender notices for 2017 and 2018. Reports have yet to be prepared for these years and, therefore, a preliminary view of 2017 and 2018 tender publication activity is provided. </p><p>I understand that prior to 2013, only above OJEU threshold reports were prepared for the annual statistical report under Article 75 of the European Procurement Directive 2004/18/EC, a smaller number of tender notices are included for 2011 and 2012.  <table><tr><th>Tender Notices Published</th><th></th></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Year</td><td>Volume</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,130</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>937</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5,826</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>5,440</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>4,999</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>5,073</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5,828</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>4,622</td></tr></table></p><p>The accuracy of the data is dependent on that entered on eTenders by public sector buyers. While the tendering process is facilitated through eTenders, the complete data on public contracts is held by the contracting authority concerned. Tenders cancelled after they are published may not always be recorded on eTenders and this should also be borne in mind in reviewing the volume of tender notices. </p><p>I would point out that the <i>Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis</i>reports published by the OGP provide further data analysis and comparisons based on tender notices.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.  Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) opened in June 2018 for the four post-primary schools to be established in 2019, including the new 600 pupil school to serve the Drogheda and Laytown school planning areas.  My Department is currently preparing assessment reports for the NSEG and it is anticipated that the successful patrons will be announced later in October 2018.  The assessment reports, including details on the number of parental preferences received for each of the areas and the NSEG recommendations, will be made available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The wide range of opportunities offered through the apprenticeship programme should be a key part of this process.</p>  <p>  As the deputy will know, the Government are currently expanding the range of programmes on offer beyond the craft apprenticeships into areas such as financial services, ICT, hospitality, biopharma and logistics. </p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out an independent review on career guidance which will be completed shortly.  The review will examine the quality and range of information and resources available to students in schools and other settings.  This will include an examination of how apprenticeship opportunities are presented to students in our schools.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS is currently reviewing pathways to participation in apprenticeship.  The review will identify any barriers that may exist to participation in an apprenticeship programme. The importance of the role of schools at second level in promoting apprenticeship opportunities, and in particular the role of guidance counsellors are being looked at in the context of the review, which will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a national promotional campaign, Generation Apprenticeship, has been underway since May 2017, led by the Apprenticeship Council and with co-ordination support from SOLAS.  The campaign promotes apprenticeship on TV and radio along with social media platforms that include Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. It has been designed to inform parents, teachers and potential apprentices on the career paths and further educational opportunities arising from apprenticeship programmes.  In addition, the staff of Education &amp;amp; Training Boards play a critical role in promoting apprenticeship by visiting employers, schools and attending career fairs.</p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions. Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.</p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board, which is now under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour. The guidance document on Developing a Code of Behaviour advises that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published <i>Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties</i>, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document <i>Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support </i>also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p><p>Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.</p><p>Following a request by the Department for policy advice from the NCSE, which provided recommendations in relation to crisis situations and complex behavioural needs, work on developing guidelines for school is underway. The Department will engage with education partners on these in the coming months. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. The guidelines will assist schools in responding in circumstances where students pose an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others.</p><p>The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that restraint intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.</p><p>Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.</p><p>Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla or to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with the Department's procedures. The Department has, to date in 2018, received one complaint which referenced a child protection concern relating to restraint and this complaint was dealt with in accordance with Departmental procedures, including referral to Tusla.</p></reply>

If you can provide further information regarding the information you are seeking, my department will attempt to be of assistance. </p>  <p>  I recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools, having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.</p>  <p>  Restoring capitation funding as resources permit is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education and I remain committed to achieving this. However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. In that regard it is critical that any additional resources that are available in the education sector are utilised in such a way as to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, as post-primary level.</p></reply>

Enhanced rates are payable to Special Schools and Special Classes attached to mainstream primary schools, the rates are determined by the special education needs category of the class. The enhanced capitation rate for primary ASD special classes is &euro;840 per pupil (inclusive of the mainstream rate of &euro;170). </p>  <p>  The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</p>  <p>  The standard per capita grant for voluntary secondary schools is &euro;296 per pupil. At Post Primary level, an additional enhanced capitation grant of &euro;190 per pupil is currently only paid in respect of pupils enrolled in special classes for mild or moderate general learning disability.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (2016) included a recommendation to extend the enhanced level of capitation grant to post-primary schools with special classes on the same basis as primary schools to assist them with the increased running costs associated with these classes. The estimated cost of implementing this recommendation for the current school year is approximately &euro;1.1m.</p>  <p>  My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and representatives from other Departments and agencies to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.  </p>  <p>  While a number of the recommendations have already been partially or substantially implemented, work is planned on the implementation of the remaining recommendations. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to prepare a progress report setting out expected timeframes for full implementation and I expect that report in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-02a.553.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200065#WRL01300"><p>When schools are implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle, they have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward. </p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle. </p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History has been developed by the NCCA. This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification has been introduced in all schools from September 2018.  </p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students. The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. </p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years. For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of history, news and current affairs too.</p></reply>

The first priority is that the care needs of the pupils are met on an ongoing basis during the school year. </p>  <p>  In June 2012, my Department, in conjunction with the School Management Bodies and the relevant Trade Unions, agreed a Career Break Scheme for Special Needs Assistants in Recognised Primary and Post-Primary Schools, the provisions for which are contained in Circular Letter 22/2012.

Notwithstanding, processing times are on a par and in many cases have been significantly improved upon compared to those at the corresponding date last year.  </p><p>The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as the volumes and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods - now just coming off the busiest time of the year for visa applications generally - seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.</p><p>In relation to applications under the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC), there had been an exponential increase from the second quarter of 2015 in the number of such applications.  That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive were detected and dealt with appropriately.  Considerable progress has being made in that regard with the majority of these applications now processed.</p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

The JARC programmes thus offer tailored supports and practical help to participants with addiction, educational, training or other needs, and are implemented with the assistance and expertise of other State agencies as well as community-based organisations.  </p><p>JARC participants are closely monitored by the relevant agencies at all times.  Any negative behaviour, and particular any further offending, is quickly detected and dealt with through effective inter-agency co-operation.  </p><p>JARC was first piloted under three Dublin-based programmes for adult offenders, as follows:</p><p>- STRIVE: This programme is aimed at persons with a history of causing high levels of harm or disruption to a designated area of north Dublin.</p><p>- Change Works: This programme is aimed at persons across the Dublin Metropolitan Region who have a history of violent offending.</p><p>- ACER 3: This programme is aimed at persons in the Garda districts of Kevin Street and Tallaght who have a repeated and prolific history of burglary.</p><p>Independent evaluations have now been completed on the three pilot JARC programmes, along with a comparative &lsquo;desktop&rsquo; review, by an expert internal group, of those three evaluations.  The findings from these evaluations and from the desktop review were presented at the first JARC National Conference on 25 September.  While it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions given the relatively small numbers of programme participants and short measurement timeframes, all the indications are that the pilot programmes have helped to reduce both the frequency and severity of reoffending and, furthermore, have helped some participants to move completely away from crime.  For example, the evaluations indicate that during the period under review:</p><p>- 37% of Change Works participants did not reoffend;</p><p>- Almost 30% of STRIVE participants did not reoffend;</p><p>- 15% of ACER 3 participants did not reoffend, with a reduction in offending noted among a further 45% of participants.</p><p>Further information, including detailed statistical information, on the pilot projects can be found in the report of the desktop review, which is available on my Department's website and that of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In 2017, the ACER 3 programme was extended to a further three regional locations: Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.  In addition, a pilot Youth J-ARC initiative, aimed at 16-21 year olds, was launched in July 2017 in locations in Cork and west Dublin.  </p><p>My Department and the three key agencies are working together on a standardised JARC evaluation framework to bring greater consistency across the programmes in such matters as selection and de-selection criteria, allocation of resources, measurement of harm, costs and benefits, and data gathering.  This, along with increased participant numbers and programme durations, will enable more robust analysis and evaluation of the JARC programmes individually, comparatively and collectively.  This, in turn, will help to inform operational decisions on the continuation and further expansion of JARC in the future as resources permit and subject to evidence of its sustained effectiveness.</p></reply>

In pursuance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in 2017 to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.  It is intended that the scheme will run for three years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, CCTV, Order 2006, SI No 289 of 2006.  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee:</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and </p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the number of applications to the scheme and funds approved have both increased:  There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme.  19 applications have been approved, with grant aid totalling more than &euro;453,000 already approved, from the total &euro;1 million available for 2018.  A further five applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered.  The remaining three applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>It is important to note that in establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General as well as with stakeholders including County and City Management Association, CCMA, Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, Irish Rural Link as well as interested community groups.  The application process and documentation were also streamlined, compared to the earlier community CCTV grant aid scheme operated by Pobal, on behalf of the Department. </p><p>Nonetheless and in response to the queries from some groups and local authorities, my officials continue to engage on the matter in particular through the LGMA and the CCMA, to address any concerns and clarify any queries arising.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns on the legislative basis for CCTV.  However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  We expect findings from this process to be of great assistance to local authorities as they carry out their function of data controller.</p><p>As I have said in the past, I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website -<i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie  </i></p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  In that regard, I understand that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that 30 mountain bikes have been purchased in 2018.

The publication of this Report now concludes the challenging work programme of the Personal Injuries Commission since its establishment in January 2017.</p><p>The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission was one of the key recommendations from the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance approved by Government and published in January 2017.  The Personal Injuries Commission was chaired by Justice Nicholas Kearns, former President of the High Court. The Personal Injuries Commission has made a total of 14 recommendations across its two reports which are aimed at positively impacting the overall Irish claims environment. </p><p>The Second and Final Report of the Personal Injuries Commission makes ten recommendations and the implementation of which will be a matter for each of the bodies responsible.  The Report does not specify timelines for the implementation of the recommendations due to the nature of them, however it is expected that they will be acted upon by the bodies responsible as soon as possible.</p><p>In this regard, I am writing to relevant Government colleagues, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Health, and other organisations including the Garda Commissioner, Insurance Ireland, The Law Society, The Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Law Reform Commission seeking co-operation in advancing the implementation of the recommendations relevant to them.</p><p>The Second and Final Report of the Personal Injuries Commission also provides an update on the recommendations from the First Report.</p><p>As the Personal Injuries Commission was established following a recommendation in the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017, it is intended that progress on implementation will be monitored through the Cost of Insurance Working Group Quarterly Progress Reports published by my colleague Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy.</p><p>The table sets out the timelines for implementation of the recommendations from the First Report.</p><p><b>Recommendations from the First Report of the Personal Injuries Commission</b><table><tr><th>Recommendation</th><th>A Standardised Approach to examination of and reporting on soft-tissue injuries should be adopted.</th></tr><tr><td>Suggested timeframe for implementation</td><td>To allow for the changeover in examination and reporting procedures it is suggested that a timeframe of by mid-2018 is appropriate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1. The Quebec Task Force (QTF) Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) grading should be used going forward by all medical professionals reporting on relevant injuries.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) should be included going forward as part of personal injury medical reporting examinations.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3. Additional tests should be at the discretion of the examining medical professional.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4. The template form included in Appendix 6 of the Report should be used by examining medical professionals in all relevant cases. <br /><br />4 a) Insurers should ensure that all cases commissioned by them from medical examiners going forward are completed in line with the template form 4 b) PIAB should redesign their Form B going forward to reflect the recommended standardised template. <br /><br />4 c) Court Rules changes should be considered which would require reports to be produced using the standardised format. <br /><br />4 d) The use of standardised Medical reports should be included in any pre-action protocol developed for personal injury claims.</td></tr><tr><td>Action Points</td><td>5. Relevant medical professional bodies to publish, as soon as possible, guidelines in respect of training for use by medical professionals. </td></tr><tr><td>Recommendation</td><td>Training and Accreditation of medical professionals who   complete personal injury medical reports should be promoted. This should become &lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo; and training should be introduced at the CPD level.</td></tr><tr><td>Suggested timeframe for implementation</td><td>By end 2018</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1. All those involved in commissioning reports should ensure the use of accredited medical professionals for completion of their personal injury medical reports, when the relevant training and accreditation programmes are in place. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2. Members of the PIAB panel completing personal injury medical reports should in respect of completion of relevant injury medical reports, when the relevant training and accreditation programmes are in place, be accredited accordingly. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3. The Accreditation requirement should be included in any pre-action protocol developed for personal injury claims.</td></tr><tr><td>Action Points</td><td>4. The quality of the training should be monitored from implementation in the same manner applicable to existing CPD programmes.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5.  The CPD training could be delivered by individual medical professional bodies to their members or by independent training providers to medical professional bodies and medical practitioners.</td></tr><tr><td>Recommendation</td><td>Link future publications of the Book of Quantum to the newly standardised examination and reporting injury categories i.e. &lsquo;whiplash&rsquo; soft-tissue injuries / QTF WAD scales. The Cost of Insurance Working Group report of January 2017 recommends that the next review of the Book of Quantum should take account of the output of the work of the PIC. This recommendation highlights the output of the initial PIC report in terms of its potential impact on this next review.</td></tr><tr><td>Suggested timeframe for implementation</td><td>2019 when the next Book of Quantum is due for publication</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Action Points </td><td>1. PIAB to consider in the context of the next Book of Quantum.</td></tr><tr><td>Recommendation</td><td>Relevant injury data should be collated and published by appropriate bodies</td></tr><tr><td>Suggested timeframe for implementation</td><td>By end 2018</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1. PIAB to produce information going forward relating to the incidence of &rsquo;whiplash&rsquo; soft-tissue injuries.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Action Points </td><td>2. Other relevant bodies to publish data relating to the incidence of &lsquo;whiplash&rsquo; soft-tissue injuries. There may be merit that such data available from insurers forms part of the National Claims Information Database which is being developed by the Central Bank of Ireland and which needs consideration by the relevant parties involved.</td></tr><tr><td>Suggested timeframe for implementation</td><td>By end 2018.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the sector, and online retailing has grown rapidly in Ireland. The increasing prevalence of online shopping is requiring retailers to adopt innovative technologies as well as creating more distinctive offerings in their physical stores.</p><p>Despite this shift, statistics from the CSO show that in 2017 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, with only 28% able to facilitate online ordering.</p><p>As an initial response to the need to support the retail sector to develop a more competitive online offering, my Department has launched a &euro;625,000 Online Retail Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland. This new pilot competitive scheme will support Irish-owned SMEs with between 20 and 250 employees in the retail sector to enhance their online presence, strengthen their online trading ability, and build a more resilient business in the domestic and global marketplace both online and offline. Applicant companies must have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.</p><p>In setting out the criteria for this pilot, our priority is to focus on companies which have started an online journey and which will have the most immediate impact. Once the pilot is complete and a cohort of companies have availed of this support, we will be able to evaluate and take on board any lessons for future initiatives in this space. We anticipate that this pilot scheme will open for applications at the end of October 2018. More information is available on the Enterprise Ireland website. .</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) offer Trading Online Vouchers (TOVs) of &euro;2,500, which are available to retail businesses with less than 10 employees to help them trade online. By the end of 2017, over 4,100 small businesses had successfully applied for a Trading Online Voucher. Up to end June 2018, an additional 580 vouchers have provisionally been approved. Results from businesses in receipt of the TOV show that their sales increased by 20%.</p><p>For retail businesses that fall outside the criteria of the trading online schemes, there are many other financial and non-financial supports available to assist individual businesses. These include the Framework for Town Centre Renewal, Project 2040 Funding, various Local Authority schemes offering distinct supports for retailers such as rates and financial incentives, development contributions, and shop-front improvement grants, and a variety of training and mentoring services offered through the Local Enterprise Offices.  </p></reply>

Ireland has experienced economic growth at a faster pace than any of us envisaged in 2015 and is, in fact, the fastest growing economy in the EU. </p>  <p>  The pace of economic growth has, however, given rise to certain constraints which we are all aware of. I recognise that there are vulnerabilities within our enterprise base, including concentrations in certain sectors and lower productivity performance in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across the economy. I am aware that skills shortages could constrict growth and that our labour force participation levels for certain cohorts are often lower than other comparable countries. Looking to the longer term, Project Ireland 2040 projects an increase in population of around 1 million people by 2040 requiring 660,000 additional jobs to be created over that period.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I know that Ireland&rsquo;s future economic prospects will be shaped by international developments including Brexit and growing international protectionism. Moreover, technological change will continue to fundamentally alter the types of jobs we will have in the future as well as the types of businesses supporting those jobs.</p>  <p>  While the Government have comprehensively developed strategies which address many of these key challenges, we must avoid complacency and prepare for an uncertain future building on the strengths and successes of the Action Plan for Jobs process and Enterprise 2025. We need to be innovative in our approach to effectively tackle long-standing structural issues, to capture new areas of opportunity and to position Ireland for sustainable growth.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, in July, the Government agreed to an ambitious initiative to guide the next phase of Ireland's economic development - Future Jobs.  The initiative will be developed jointly by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.  It will harness the coordinated commitment across many Government Departments and agencies established through previous initiatives. </p>  <p>  Future Jobs will emphasise building resilience through improving productivity especially among Irish SMEs; enhancing skills levels and increasing participation in the labour force; preparedness for, and exploitation of, anticipated transformational changes arising from technological developments and the transition to a low carbon and digital based economy. </p>  <p>  My Department, supported by the Department of the Taoiseach, aims to host a National Summit in November that will be an opportunity to road-test the emerging Future Jobs 2019 with policy makers and wider stakeholders before it is finalised and published in early 2019. My officials will shortly be engaging with key stakeholders, including social partners, to garner their insights.</p></reply>

If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority (MSA) in the State. Where an economic operator fails to take the action required, the relevant MSA will investigate and can order the economic operator to take the necessary corrective action. Where a product sold online originates in a country outside the EU, the economic operator will have to comply with the relevant customs authorities (whether in the State or in another jurisdiction) in relation to legislation covering products at point of entry into the EU.</p>  <p>  There are a number of different MSAs in the State depending on the particular product in question. For example, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of EU law for certain products that are placed on the market, including electrical products within a certain voltage range, certain items of personal protective equipment and toys. Investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC. Section 9(5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions. Therefore, I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in such matters.</p>  <p>  More generally, Section 42 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that a trader shall not engage in a misleading commercial practice. Section 43 of the Act provides that a commercial practice is misleading if it includes the provision of false information or would be likely to cause the average consumer to be deceived or misled in relation to a range of matters, and if this would cause the average consumer to make a transactional or purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make. The matters specified under section 43 include the risks a product presents to consumers; the results to be expected from a product; the results and material features of tests or checks carried out on the product; and the existence, extent or nature of any approval or sponsorship of the product by others.  </p>  <p>  Section 47 of the Act provides that a trader who engages in a misleading commercial practice under section 43 commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction or conviction on indictment to the penalties laid down in the Act. Breach of section 43 also constitutes a 'prohibited act or practice' under section 67 of the Act and can be subject to a number of other enforcement options provided for in Part 5 of the Act, including prohibition orders (i.e. injunctions) and compliance notices. Section 74 of the Act provides that a consumer aggrieved by a prohibited act or practice has a right of action for damages, including exemplary damages, against the trader who commits or engages in the prohibited act or practice.</p></reply>

Some 32 applications exceeded the standard required for funding, following assessment by an external assessor, Committee adjudication and approval by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland announced the results on 1 June 2016 and the company in question was successful. All letters of offer under the Community Enterprise Initiative were dispatched on the day the Scheme's successful applicants were announced, including the letter of offer to the company concerned. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has informed me that there has been a modification to the project as originally proposed.

However, I can provide background information on this litigation and clarify matters that are already in the public domain. </p>  <p>  As of 24 September 2018, letters of potential claims against the Minister, the Health Services Executive and GlaxoSmithKline Biological SA have been initiated by seventy three individuals and in 61 of these cases formal legal proceedings have been issued. The plaintiffs allege personal injury in which they claim the development of narcolepsy resulted from the administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.  </p>  <p>  The management of these cases transferred to the State Claims Agency on 15 October 2013 when the Taoiseach signed the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013. It would not be appropriate for me as Minister to interfere in the management of these claims which are delegated to the State Claims Agency. </p>  <p>  It should also be observed that the European Medicines Agency has formally responded to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) publication referred to in the question, stating that it considers that the article misrepresents the work of the European Medicines Agency and draws incorrect conclusions based on scientifically invalid comparisons of data. The Agency has described the conclusions in the BMJ article as flawed and misleading to readers and the wider public. </p>  <p>  My main priority as Minister for Health is that individuals and families affected receive appropriate health and social care supports.  My Department continues to engage with the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure the provision of a range of services and supports, on an ex-gratia basis.  The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with other service providers and Government Departments to facilitate access to required services. It is in regular contact with the individuals affected and their families; and regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance on what further improvements can be made to the legal framework governing the management of, inter alia, certain vaccine damage cases.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the impact on the lives of these people and families affected by narcolepsy and reiterate my commitment to the on-going provision of appropriate services and supports.</p></reply>

Neither the Galway hospice nor the Red Door Project Addiction Services, Drogheda are included in the pilot process.  The 50 organisations included were agreed at the WRC by all parties.</p>  <p>  I asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented. The HSE has completed the first phase of their work in relation to the agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Two conciliation meetings took place between the parties at the WRC in July 2018. These talks reconvened on 18 September 2018 and will continue on 2 October 2018. </p></reply>

It is an individual specific treatment prescribed by the treating consultant psychiatrist based on an assessment of the patient concerned. </p>  <p>  ECT can be administered as a lifesaving treatment in catatonia, acute suicidality and where patients have stopped eating and drinking as a result of severe depressive illness.  Elderly persons may be administered ECT where an individual&rsquo;s health or life is at risk due to self-neglect.  It is also occasionally used in patients who are unable to tolerate antidepressant treatment as a result of severe side effects or adverse side effects.</p>  <p>  ECT is an extremely effective treatment in appropriately assessed and selected patients and the evidence base for its use is significant.  Early use of ECT is also associated with shorter and less costly hospital stays while it has also been reported to enhance health related quality of life and activities of daily living.</p>  <p>  The College of Psychiatry of Ireland carried out an analysis of treatment outcomes for a group of involuntary patients administered ECT under section 59(1)(b) of the Mental Health Act 2001.  93% of patients were recorded as having made either a significant recovery or complete recovery.  These figures are in keeping with international figures.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland and the use of ECT is regulated in accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001 as amended.  This Act includes robust legal safeguards which provide that ECT can only be administered to involuntary patients in accordance with Rules drawn up by the Commission.  The most recent legislative change regarding ECT was in 2016 when the 2001 Act was amended to ensure that involuntary patients with capacity can no longer be given ECT against their will. </p>  <p>  The latest available figures from the Commission on the use of ECT in approved centres show that 263 people were administered ECT in 2016.  The majority of programmes of ECT were administered to residents who were admitted on a voluntary basis when they commenced their programme of ECT, accounting for in excess of 80% of programmes of ECT.</p>  <p>  ECT is one form of treatment used for treating persons with mental illness and I have no specific plans to make available any recourse or redress measures for persons who have received ECT or any other treatment for mental illness.</p></reply>

They agreed that High Court Justice Charles Meenan would chair the Group which would advise on whether there are alternative mechanisms to the current court process for resolving clinical negligence and personal injury claims. </p>  <p>  Judge Meenan's Expert Group will especially examine the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively yet more sensitively with certain cases.  In this process the Group will also look at the impact of tort legislation on the overall patient safety culture and open disclosure. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for this work are:</p>  <p>  a) review the law of torts from the perspective of the management of clinical negligence and personal injury claims in order to assess the effectiveness of the legal framework and to advise on and make recommendations on what further legal reforms or operational changes could be made to improve the current system;</p>  <p>  b) consider whether there may be an alternative mechanism to the court process for resolving clinical negligence claims, or particular categories of claims, particularly from the perspective of the person who has made the claim. To do this, the Group will examine whether a mechanism could be established which would deal more sensitively and in a more timely fashion with catastrophic birth injuries, certain vaccine damage claims, or with claims where there is no dispute about liability from the outset. It will also examine whether an alternative dispute resolution mechanism or a no-fault system would be effective in some cases; </p>  <p>  c) examine the role of the HSE in addressing the problems encountered by persons involved in clinical negligence claims and addressing the health needs of persons affected by clinical negligence, with consideration given to whether particular care packages could be made available for persons with specific injuries, e.g. cerebral palsy following birth;</p>  <p>  d) examine the role of the State Claims Agency in managing clinical negligence claims on behalf of the HSE to determine whether improvements can be made to the current claims management process;   </p>  <p>  e) consider the impact of current tort legislation on the overall patient safety culture, including reporting on open disclosure.</p>  <p>  In July this year, Judge Meenan issued a press statement and invited submissions from the public and other relevant parties on the Group's terms of reference. It received 39 submissions from interested parties which will inform the deliberations of the Group during the course of its work.  I expect that the Group will examine mediation as part of its work on alternative mechanisms.  The Group met for the first time on 5 September to commence its work and I look forward to receiving Judge Meenan's Interim Report after three months and his final report in February 2019.</p></reply>

For the health priority, the funding available for the duration of the Programme is &euro;62m, &euro;53m of which is EU funding.  </p>  <p>  A number of the successful projects will be led by the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Co-Operation and Working Together (CAWT) Partnership.  These projects are in the areas of Mental Health, Acute Services; Health and Wellbeing and Children's Services.  In addition, CAWT is a partner in a project on Primary Care and Older People which is led by NHS 24 (Scotland).</p>  <p>  The Acute Services project, which I believe the Deputy is referring to in his question, is called The Connecting Services, Citizens and Communities Project.  It was approved for funding of around &euro;8m by the Special EU Programmes Body Steering Committee. Around 13,000 patients in the border region, including County Louth, will benefit from the implementation of the project.     </p>  <p>  The project aims to enhance access to high priority medical and surgical interventions for people living far from regional hospital centres.  The project aims to modernise acute services provision through the use of new and innovative technologies such as e-health solutions.  Remote patient interaction will also be supported through the use of consultation by video conferencing technology.  The project has both scheduled and unscheduled care work streams.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that County Louth patients will benefit from a number of aspects of the project including the establishment of a Clinical Decision Unit in Daisyhill Hospital, Newry for unscheduled care; an Emergency Department Improvement Programme; the development of a Dermatology service and an investment in hospital equipment.  It is estimated that approximately 500 patients will directly benefit from the Clinical Decision Unit and Dermatology service.  In addition all patients attending Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital's Emergency Department should benefit from a stream-lined patient pathway.</p></reply>

Waiting times can often unacceptably long and I am conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.  </p>  <p>  Waiting List figures from the NTPF for the end of August show that 47 patients are on the IPDC Ophthalmology Waiting List in Louth County Hospital.  All patients are seen within 6 months and 68% of those on the list are waiting 3 months or less.  The IPDC Ophthalmology waiting list in Louth County Hospital shows that numbers have decreased by over 32% when compared with the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The latest NTPF figures show that there are 40,641 patients on the Ophthalmology Outpatient Waiting List.  This shows that there has been a 6.1% increase when compared with the same period last year.  There are 715 patients on the combined Ophthalmology Outpatient waiting lists in OLOL and Louth County Hospitals.  Nearly 75% of these are waiting less than 9 months and 60% are waiting less than 6 months.</p>  <p>  Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government and &euro;50 million was provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) in 2018 to secure treatment for patients.  The Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan, published last April outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan places a particular focus on cataract surgery and includes a commitment that the NTPF will provide 5,000 cataract procedures to patients.  In addition, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for a cataract procedure.</p>  <p>  The impact of the Action Plan can be seen in the improvements to the National Waiting Lists for Cataracts which have seen a reduction of over 3,100 over the past 13 months.  August figures for cataracts show that there are now 6,868 on the waiting list, compared to over 10,000 in July 2017.  The number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract procedure has gone from over 4,300 in July 2017 to 1,078 in August 2018, with 64% of patients waiting 3 months or less.</p>  <p>  The IPDC Ophthalmology waiting list shows that numbers have decreased by almost 20% when compared with the same period last year, and the number of long waiters has decreased by over 56%.  </p>  <p>  Over the past year, my Department has worked with the HSE and the NTPF to identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times.  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital which facilitated the expansion of the Hospital&rsquo;s cataract theatre to three days per week. </p>  <p>  A dedicated cataract service commenced at the end of July in Nenagh Hospital.  The University of Limerick Hospital Group advise that they expect to deliver 200 cataract procedures by the end of the year and are targeting 2,000 cataract cases for 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund, is in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for the remainder of 2018 which I hope to publish shortly.  The Plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with their National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the NTPF has recently commenced trialling a number of outpatient interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics.  The NTPF has invited proposals from hospital groups and to date this has resulted in the approval of 12,600 outpatient appointments.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and to deliver improved services and supports.  The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE.  The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.  Plans are progressing to further implement the Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways.  </p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports.  It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered.  The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website.  This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country.  The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.  </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites.  An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide.  </p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, provide expert knowledge and leadership, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice.  Work is under way to further determine the scope and requirements for this role.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; an evaluation of services for people with early onset dementia; and community support projects for people with dementia.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of additional resources, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning. </p></reply>

Any manufacture, supply or sale of this product for the purposes of treating a medical condition is illegal.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA is the competent authority for medicines in Ireland. The Authority has an Enforcement section, which is responsible for investigating potential breaches of medicines legislation and, where necessary, taking corrective action, including legal proceedings.

The HPRA's investigations are prioritised on the basis of perceived risk to public health.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA has taken enforcement actions against the supplier of MMS, resulting in the prosecution and conviction of the person responsible in Ireland for such supply.  The HPRA continually monitors online platforms for the promotion and sale of unauthorised medicines, including MMS.

This is on top of the &euro;250 million spend every year on drug and alcohol services and programmes across all government departments and state agencies.  The main priority in 2018 was to expand provision of drug and alcohol treatment services and to reduce waiting times. </p>  <p>  Over &euro;27.85m has been allocated to Task Forces by the HSE and the Department of Health for community-based drugs initiatives this year.  This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided for the last four years. This included an additional &euro;250,000 in one off funding to improve the organisational effectiveness of the Task Forces in implementing the national drugs strategy. </p>  <p>  I recently announced &euro;1 million in once-off funding to support and enhance addiction services nationwide.  This included &euro;290,000 in funding for Task Forces for community-based initiatives.  In addition, &euro;710,000 was allocated to the HSE to fund priority projects and services and new initiatives in the nine CHO areas, to be identified following consultation with the task forces. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the growing demands and pressures on drug and alcohol treatment services around the country.  The provision of additional funding for drug and alcohol addiction services, including task forces, will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2019. As the estimates process is ongoing it is not possible for me to comment in advance on the outcome of this process.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia.  Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.</p>  <p>  The Strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the Strategy.  The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia.  Additional projects are being funded through &euro;6.26 million in Dormant Accounts funding secured by the Department of Health in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports.  It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website.  This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country.  The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development.  This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia.  It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites.  An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September. and recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide.  I welcome the positive results of the evaluation and will continue to work to improve service delivery for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice.  It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners.  The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018.  The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland.  The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific requests for funding referred to by the Deputy, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

Containing 42 actions across four national goals, it sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government departments and agencies to carers.  I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made on a large number of actions, and the Department of Health is determined to offer as much support as possible to family carers throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of the necessary legislation, free GP care has been extended to those in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit since 1 September this year.  Furthermore, in December 2017, the Government announced the provision of an additional &euro;10 million specifically to enhance respite care in the disability sector, which has had a positive impact to date.  &euro;8 million of this provides for the equivalent of 12 new houses, one in each CHO, with an additional three in the Greater Dublin area. The remaining &euro;2 million is for innovative respite solutions, such as Home Sharing and extended day services, to provide assistance where people need it most.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also secured funding through the Dormant Accounts fund to enable the HSE to pilot a Carer's Needs Assessment in one Community Healthcare Organisation.  The HSE developed this tool with significant input from the Family Carer Reference Group, which represents a national network of over 200 carer groups across Ireland.  The assessment will assist in identifying the needs of carers across all care groups and will track health and wellbeing outcomes for carers over time.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to ensuring that family carers receive as much support as possible to allow them to continue caring for their loved ones.  Both the Department and the HSE will continue to engage with family carer organisations to address the needs of carers. </p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

Where vacancies exist, the HSE endeavours to fill essential posts on a locum or temporary contract basis to support service delivery.  The HSE is also committed to improving the recruitment process, offering contracts to the Hospital Group rather than individual sites and focusing on family friendly arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission concluded a review in respect of key health service grades, including consultants.  With regard to recruitment of consultants, the Commission stated that the aggregate level of vacancies for consultant posts at the end of 2017 and evidence of low level of applications for recruitment campaigns would suggest a general difficulty recruiting consultants.  </p>  <p>  In terms of pay, it also identified the two-tier pay system as being one of number of factors affecting recruitment and found that the differential in pay between pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants.  The Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address this difficulty. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department and the HSE have noted the Commission's views and consideration will need to be given to potential solutions which are in line with public sector pay policy and available budgets.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE.  Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.</p>  <p>  The strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented.  It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and primary care teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the strategy.  The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia.  Additional projects have been funded by the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports.  It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered.  The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website.  This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country.  The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development.  This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia.  It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites.  An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September.  It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide.</p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice.  It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners.  The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018.  The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland.  The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE through the community drugs schemes, it must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Framework Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse it.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland. However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p></reply>

This is irrespective of whether a person has private health insurance cover. However, for a specified episode of in-patient services, where a person does not avail of, or waives his/her right to public in-patient services, but instead avails of private in-patient services for example private consultant services, he/she shall not have eligibility for public in-patient services for that episode of in-patient care. </p>  <p>  Patients opting to be treated privately have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides.

It is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).</p>  <p>  Infection with Lyme disease is generally mild and patients are generally treated by their family doctor. If there are more severe complications, the patient can be referred for specialist assessment and treatment. It is important that those suffering from the symptoms associated with Lyme disease seek the most appropriate medical attention available.</p>  <p>  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  </p>  <p>  Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Whereas Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly and are also accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the relevant tests correctly, testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards) to a similar degree, giving rise to a greater degree of risk of diagnosis of a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result or interpreting equivocal results in a manner that is more likely to give rise to verification bias.</p>  <p>  Best practice dictates that if a patient presents for medical treatment with a report / test from another EU member state, the GP or consultant would examine the patient using both clinical and laboratory diagnostics before they would be in a position to prescribe a course of treatment for them.  The same protocol would apply across most other EU member states as the GP or consultant would need to be totally satisfied that the patient is correctly diagnosed while getting the right course of treatment for their illness. </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.  The HPSC provides advice and information concerning developments regarding the testing and treatment of Lyme disease to my Department. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. There is a GP representative on this committee.  </p>  <p>  The suggestion of an appointment of a general practitioner champion for Lyme disease may be considered by this committee. I have referred your question to the HSE for further clarification.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Sitka spruce grows well in Ireland because it is suited to our soils and climate.  It has been grown successfully for over 80 years and it has proven itself to be one of the most productive coniferous species grown in Ireland and as such has become the industry&rsquo;s mainstay in terms of timber processing and end markets.  As one of our fastest growing tree species, Sitka spruce has an important role to play in carbon sequestration.  A typical productive plantation of Sitka spruce will result in removals of 10 tonnes of CO2e per annum per hectare on average over a full rotation.</p><p>The table below shows the area planted under Sitka spruce from 2007 &ndash;

The review found that some targets were not being met including the 30% planting target for native broadleaves.</p><p>Following an extensive consultation process with stakeholders, my Department implemented a series of actions to promote native broadleaves.  The grants and premiums for broadleaves were increased by 7 % and 5% respectively and the minimum mandatory percentage of broadleaves in any individual afforestation project was increased from 10% to 15%.  Last week Minister Doyle also launched the Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) which is a Corporate Social Responsibility project, aimed at corporate entities, to promote and encourage the planting of broadleaves.</p><p>The increases in premiums and grants, the increase in the minimum mandatory percentage of broadleaves in all afforestation projects, the promotion of Agro-forestry and Forestry for Fibre and the launch of the WEF is expected to  lead to an increase in the planting of native broadleaves.</p><p>The number of hectares planted with broadleaves in each of the years 2007 to 2017, is

Electrical stimulation or shock collars for training dogs are designed to produce lower stimuli lasting milliseconds rather than produce a sustained electric current. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a consultation process for an Animal Welfare Strategy.

The legislation provides for a period of public and statutory consultation.</p><p>All applications in &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; areas i.e. areas designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and/or Special Protection Areas (SPAs) are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats and/or Birds Directives.  The obligation to undertake an Appropriate Assessment derives from Article 6(3) and 6(4) of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC as transposed into Irish legislation by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011. West of Ardara/Maas Road has been designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. An Appropriate Assessment report has been completed by the Marine Institute in respect of aquaculture applications located in or adjacent to the West of Ardara/Maas Road SAC and considers the risks posed by the proposed activities to the conservation features of the Natura 2000 site.  The assessment process complies with best scientific practice. </p><p>My Department has prepared a draft Appropriate Assessment Conclusion Statement which outlines how it is proposed to manage aquaculture in the West of Ardara/Maas Road Special Area of Conservation in compliance with the Habitats Directive.  This draft Conclusion Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<i></i></p><p>The Appropriate Assessment Conclusion Statement, which is currently in draft form, supplements the Appropriate Assessment report and should be read in conjunction with it.  The Conclusion Statement will be finalised taking account, if appropriate, of any written submissions or observations made to my Department during the public and statutory consultation phase for aquaculture applications as they relate to the conservation features in the West of Ardara/Maas Road SAC, and any other relevant information. The statutory and public consultation phase for aquaculture licence applications in this SAC is now concluded.</p><p>My Department is continuing to examine the aquaculture licence applications in the West of Ardara/ Maas Road SAC in accordance with the applicable legislation and full account is being taken of the engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects relevant to each application. Aquaculture projects in this SAC can only be authorised if they (individually or in combination with other plans or projects) do not give rise to significant adverse impacts on the integrity of the West of Ardara/Maas Road SAC, having regard to its Conservation Objectives.</p><p>As the aquaculture licence applications in this Special Area of Conservation are under active consideration as part of a statutory process it would not be appropriate to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  Trade missions have become an integral part of this strategy, and the selection of the destination of each mission is only agreed upon after a rigorous process which takes into account varying factors, such as the existing and potential market penetration for Irish produce within the country, and whether any market access issues could potentially be resolved during the mission. </p>  <p>  To assist my Department in this area, Bord Bia carried out a market prioritisation exercise in 2017. It identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and has provided valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers. It has already helped in the choice of destinations for my most recent trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and the next one to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October 2018.</p>  <p>  At the moment I do not have any immediate plans to lead a trade mission to India but my Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

It should be noted that both of these EU regulations went through the ordinary legislative procedure at EU level which would have included widespread consultation with interested parties including the Member States, Advisory Councils, NGOs and the fishing Industry.  The matter has also been discussed at industry liaison meetings over the years.  The EU regulations on this matter are highly prescriptive in relation to licence holders, leaving little room for further negotiation.</p></reply>

This review is very close to finalisation and will be submitted to me shortly.</p>  <p>  Ireland's approach will also have regard to the EU's policy on single-use plastics (SUPs) which was announced in May, and which proposes a range of approaches to tackling the proliferation of plastics that end up as marine litter. These include a provision that Member States must take necessary measures to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of certain SUPs, including food containers and cups.  Such measures may include national consumption reduction targets, measures ensuring that reusable alternatives to those products are made available at the point of sale to the final consumer, and economic instruments to ensure that certain SUPs are not provided free of charge at the point of sale to the final consumer.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to estimate the potential revenue that might be generated from the introduction of any environmental levy based on current usage of the product in question as the primary objective of such a levy is to improve environmental behaviour, rather than to generate revenue. The Plastic Bag Levy (PBL), for example, was phenomenally successful in that regard. Following the introduction of the PBL in 2002, there was an immediate and dramatic effect on consumer behaviour as the use of plastic bags by consumers dropped from an estimated 328 bags per person per annum, prior to the levy, to 22 bags per annum by the beginning of 2004. This figure stood at just 8 bags per person per annum in 2016. Furthermore, in 2000 it was estimated that plastic bags constituted 5% of litter, whereas data received from the annual National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) showed that plastic bags constituted just 0.27% of litter in 2017.</p>  <p>  I am determined that the introduction of any other environmental levies in the future should have a similarly positive impact on people&rsquo;s behaviour to protect our environment.</p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in 2010 and requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that biofuels make up a certain percentage of annual fuel sales.  It is a certificate based scheme with two certificates awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues and one certificate per litre for all other sustainable biofuels.  For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance.  The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate, which is currently set at 8%.  This means that at the end of 2018, a fuel supplier must hold 8 biofuel certificates for every 92 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year. </p>  <p>  In 2017 the Biofuels Obligation Scheme resulted in over 225 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market in Ireland leading to over 7% renewable energy use in the transport sector compared to the 10% target for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, I published a Biofuel Obligation Scheme Policy Statement which set out six key actions that will be undertaken in the development of the scheme.  This included an increase in the biofuel obligation rate to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019 and 11% by volume from 1 January 2020.  The first of  these changes has been enacted by S.I. No. 169 of 2018 and I intend to enact the second of these changes early next year. </p></reply>

This process has unfortunately taken longer than envisaged, due to data protection issues that have arisen since the introduction of GDPR.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to introducing the annual support as soon as practically possible in conjunction with relevant agencies and stakeholders.  In line with the commitments set out in <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, </i>published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p><p>This measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced.  Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered twelve months of data to date. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. </p></reply>

CRU issued the licence to Eirgrid under S.14(1)(e) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 on 20th June 2001.  In this role as transmission system operator, EirGrid, as the national authority, is responsible for the operation, development and maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission system.  Eirgrid&rsquo;s role is to deliver connection, transmission, and market services to generators, suppliers and customers utilising the high voltage electricity system and to put in place the grid infrastructure to support the development of Ireland&rsquo;s Economy.  Moreover, EirGrid is statutorily obliged &ldquo;to explore and develop opportunities for interconnection&rdquo; as well as developing, operating and maintaining a &ldquo;safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system by virtue of Regulation 8 of SI 445 of 2000, the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, 2000.  This SI gave effect to various elements of Directive No 96/92 /EC, and specifically provided for the establishment and designation of the transmission system operator (TSO) and set out its functions.  In determining the approach to improving the operation of the All-Island Single Electricity Market, the development of an overhead line, linking sub-stations in Meath and Tyrone, was determined as the best fit, being the economical and the best technical solution.  The project has been subject to substantial study and review, with planning permission granted in December 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the two independent reports dealing with the North-South Interconnector (NSIC ) that I commissioned following engagement  with members of the Oireachtas and community interests, these were  considered by Government this morning and are being published on the website of my Department.  One considers the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the NSIC, while the second addresses comparative international practice and approaches to compensation of property owners in proximity to high-voltage lines.  On the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding, the report concludes that from a techno-economic point of view, an Alternating Current Overhead Line is the most beneficial way of meeting the need for enhanced power transfer capability between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On comparative international practice in relation to compensation, that report indicates that Ireland has a comparatively generous compensation regime in place.  </p>  <p>  The International Expert Commission who conducted the technical study met with a number of bodies, including the CRU and EirGrid, during the course of their work.  In their capacities as the national regulator and the transmission system operator, the final reports relating to the North South Interconnector were provided to both EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p>  <p>  In addition to publishing the reports on the website of my Department, I am forwarding copies of the two Reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p></reply>

Monaghan.  An investigation team engaged by the company, incorporating mining engineers from the UK, arrived at the site to assess the situation and determine the scale and cause of the subsidence and the risk of further events occurring in the area.  My Department&rsquo;s senior geologists and I visited the site on Tuesday 25th September.  Since then, officials of the Department have been liaising with the company and the other regulatory authorities on an ongoing basis and have continued to monitor the situation closely.</p><p>The initial Gyproc investigation has identified that recent mining operations involving the transport and storage of water in an old part of the mine, previously unused for water storage, resulted in the collapse.  The initial report further indicates that these circumstances do not appear to be present elsewhere in the vicinity, though the company is taking all precautions and conducting further investigations to ensure this is the case. </p><p>Gyproc has verified that the area of subsidence, known technically as the disturbance zone, at Magheracloone GAA Club is approximately 120 metres in radius.  Gyproc is confident that if there is any further subsidence, it will be confined to this zone.  Outside of the actual disturbance zone, an area including five houses and two stretches of public road has been identified for investigation.  This is being done on a precautionary basis, as is the closure to traffic of certain sections of road, including part of the main Carrickmacross to Kingscourt (R179) road.</p><p>Ireland has a mining heritage that extends back to the Bronze Age.  Mining has occurred at hundreds of sites, the majority of which are not the legal responsibility of the State (the relevant private mineral owner or landowner is responsible in most cases).  The Department maintains an inventory of sites at which historical mining is known to have occurred in compliance with Article 20 of the Extractive Industries Waste Directive (2006/21/EC). </p><p>Although the majority of abandoned mines in Ireland are not the legal responsibility of the State, over 80 individual sites have been assessed in relation to the potential risk posed to human and animal health and the environment between 2006 and 2009, as part of a joint investigation undertaken by the Geological Survey Ireland, Environmental Protection Agency and the Exploration and Mining Division of the Department. The main findings of this investigation are available from . </p><p>The high-risk mining sites identified have been inspected on numerous occasions in recent years. In collaboration with the Office of Public Works, mine safety works have been completed at a number of these sites, including Silvermines, Avoca, Allihies, Bunmahon, and various small 19th century workings. </p><p>All current underground mining operations (Navan, Drummond), and recently-closed mines (Galmoy and Lisheen), are required to undertake ground subsidence monitoring and to report the results to the Department. All current mines are, in addition, inspected twice yearly by an independent Mining Expert and the Department.</p><p>Between 1998 and 1999, the Department also contracted external consultants to independently review the subsidence risk of the underground gypsum mines, near Kingscourt. The report recommended detailed underground inspections and a programme of periodic measurement of surface levelling points and surface inspections in those areas of the mine lying below public roads and buildings. This follow-up work was undertaken by the independent consultants between 2001 and 2005. Arising from this work, a programme of subsidence monitoring was implemented at these mines by Gyproc. </p></reply>

After Brexit, trade in energy between EU Member States and the UK, including that on SEM, will involve trade with a Third Country with implications for the smooth operation of markets.  These issues, principally around regulatory alignment, level playing field, market oversight, etc., are not new and have featured in Ireland's input to the EU's negotiations with the UK.  Given the level of detailed analysis that the reports have gone into in terms of the specifics of individual  instruments and their relevance to Ireland's continuing input to EU negotiation with the UK, it would not be appropriate to publish these  reports at this time, but the key points will  be raised with the EU's negotiators.</p>  <p>  I would also point out to the Deputy that trade between the EU and Third Countries in electricity is long standing, providing greater security of supply, reduction in network constraints, increased competition  and enhanced capacity to accommodate renewable energy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the two independent reports dealing with the North-South Interconnector (NSIC) that I commissioned following engagement with members of the Oireachtas and community interests, these were considered by Government this morning and are available on my Department's website.

The guide to making an application as published on my Department's website contains a specific section on how the Department assesses applications. In this regard the key considerations used to determine the score awarded to each application are as follows:- </p><p>- The likelihood of increasing participation and/or improving performance.</p><p>- Whether the proposed facilities will be shared with other users.</p><p>- The level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area.</p><p>- The technical merits of the proposed project.</p><p>- The level of funding being provided towards the project by the applicant.</p><p>- The level of SCP funding received in the last ten years by the applicant.</p><p>The closing date for applications under the 2018 round of the SCP is Friday 19th October. All applicants are advised that the assessment process is competitive and that simply meeting the minimum criteria under the headings above does not guarantee funding. While it is highly likely that the level of demand for grants will exceed the funding available, prior to knowing the number of applications received and commencing the assessment process, it is not possible to state the percentage of applicants likely to receive a grant. </p></reply>

I can confirm that after many years of declining passenger numbers, Cork Airport returned to growth in 2016, when passenger numbers grew by 8% to more than 2.23m.  Since then passengers numbers have continued to grow with an increase of 3.5% during  2017, to 2.31m and an increase of 4% for the first half of this year over the same period in 2017.   </p>  <p>  New destinations from Cork Airport since 2017 include Reykjavik, Newquay, Verona, Zurich, Boston/Providence, Paris CDG and Lisbon.  It is also understood that Ryanair has announced five routes commencing in 2019 from Cork to London Luton, Poznan in Poland, Budapest, Malta and Naples.  </p>  <p>  While it was disappointing that the Norwegian service to Boston/Providence, which commenced in July 2017, did not operate during winter 2018, it is good to see that the service is to return to Cork for summer 2019. </p>  <p>  This turnaround in passenger numbers at Cork Airport is as a result of a number of initiatives which were put in place in recent years to encourage stakeholders in the region to work together and with airport management on improving the product on offer and thereby supporting services at the Airport.  Indeed, in recent days the Airport's success has been recognised at the World Routes Conference in China where Cork won the prestigious World Routes 2018 Marketing Award, a global accolade recognising excellence in aviation marketing for airports in its category.  It is good to see such a positive payback arising from the efforts of all concerned. </p>  <p>  However, in order for that trend to continue, it is vital that stakeholder support is maintained, as airline services will only continue if used by the travelling public.</p></reply>

The Department agreed to pay &euro;375,000 in January this year to safeguard these services for the first six months of 2018 but also to allow time for appropriate consideration of the future options at Waterford Airport.</p>  <p>  In light of the situation, my Department procured the services of independent consultants, Ernst &amp;amp; Young (EY) to conduct this review.  The runway extension proposal, to which the Deputy refers, was received during the review process and was duly incorporated into the consideration of options by EY. The proposal from Waterford Airport is dependent on securing the necessary finance from private investors, local authorities as well as significant capital funding support from the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  I brought the EY Review to this morning's Cabinet meeting for the information of Government at this stage.  I have also sought some additional information and assurances from the airport in respect of potential investors and jet carriers.  When I have fully considered the EY Review, along with any additional information provided by Waterford Airport, I have undertaken to revert to Government with a Memorandum for decision on the matter.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. In this context no funding application has been received by the Department in relation to the Clane bypass.</p>  <p>  The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and this has resulted in some grant programmes being curtailed, including the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes, in order to protect funding for road maintenance and repair and this remains the position.</p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has been allocated over &euro;29.5m in 2018. It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to Kildare County Council to fund work on this road from its own resources.</p></reply>

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year. </p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to multiple entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash;between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children. The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point. </p>  <p>  The number of entry points reverted to one at the beginning of September 2018. One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help to streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. There are currently no plans to change this single entry point.</p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5. These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children.  </p></reply>

The recent expansion of ECCE enables children to receive two full programme years of the scheme from the age of 2 years and eight months, thus, for parents who are working or in education, reducing their childcare costs by 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year.  The cost of childcare for children below ECCE age is very high, predominantly due to the required lower adult to child ratios involved in providing high quality care to infants and very young children. </p>  <p>  It was for this reason that last September (2017) I introduced a new, non means tested universal subsidy, providing up to &euro;1,040 per annum for children in this age range.  Since that time, the families of more than 40,000 children have benefitted from this subsidy. </p>  <p>  Also, for families on lower incomes that need assistance with childcare costs, I increased the level of subsidy available under existing targeted schemes.  Subsidies are now available of up to &euro;145 per week, per child to certain families.  The website affordablechildcare.ie provides more information in this regard.  Whilst these supports are a first step to assist families in lowering the cost of their childcare, much more must be done to provide truly affordable, accessible child care. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the entitlement of families in Ireland to financial support towards the cost of child care was put on a legislative footing by my Department with the enactment of the Childcare Support Act 2018.  This legislation supports a radical new infrastructure, currently under development, to introduce  a new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide both universal and targeted subsidies towards the cost of child care.  As part of the scheme, recognition is given to the additional cost of providing high quality care to children in the pre-ECCE bracket and provides a higher rate of subsidy accordingly.  The scheme should also improve access to more places for children under three given the high levels of subsidisation that will be available for these services. </p>  <p>  This country has suffered from a history of low levels of investment in childcare, leaving Ireland trailing OECD norms.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will provide a strong, sustainable platform to address this.  Through this platform, I am deeply committed to maintaining the focus on high quality, affordable and accessible child care that we have witnessed in recent budgets.  This is something I will also be placing major focus on in the forthcoming cross-Government  ten year Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.</p></reply>

Attempts by Tusla to secure continuing commercial cover have proved unsuccessful.  However, I am pleased to confirm that pending a permanent solution, all foster carers have an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  This is on an <i>ex-gratia</i>basis as a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved. </p><p>As I have stated previously, I fully support extending the State Indemnity Scheme under the State Claims Agency to foster parents.  Unfortunately, this has taken longer than expected due to technical issues associated with the approvals and statutory process involved, but I can assure the Deputy that work is continuing to address these matters.  My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible.  In this regard, work is ongoing with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the necessary Order for Government. </p><p>My Department has written to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) outlining the position and, through the Association, foster carers have been informed as to the current position.  IFCA have been kept up to date on a continuous basis.  In addition, I understand that Tusla has also made publicly available the information provided to IFCA so as to communicate the position to those foster carers who are not members of that association.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience.  AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. </p><p>Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional, targeted support is needed - over and above the universal supports provided under Levels 1 to 3 of AIM - in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for targeted supports under one or more of Levels 4 to 7 of AIM:</p><p><i>Level 4</i></p><p>This level provides access to mentoring for early years practitioners from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile.  This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting. </p><p><i>Level 5</i></p><p>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.  A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.  A once off provision for AIM Inclusive Play packs was also included in 2017 and 2018.</p><p><i>Level 6</i></p><p>This level provides access to therapeutic services, which is funded directly from the Department of Health Vote, where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme.  To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile.  The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE.  The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.</p><p><i>Level 7</i></p><p>This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting.  The AIM Level 7 budget allocation also includes the service administration fee for Pobal in relation to all of the levels of AIM support managed by Pobal.</p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016. The total funding allocated by my Department and outturn in 2016 and 2017 and funding allocated and outturn to date in 2018 for levels 4, 5 and 7 of AIM is set out below. Funding for AIM Level 6 comes from the Department of Health Vote.</p><p>The Inter-Department Group, which developed AIM recognised that it would take approximately three years to fully develop and implement the Model.</p><p>The number of children in each county who have benefitted from supports under AIM Levels 4, 5 and 7 for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 ECCE programme years is shown in the attached table.<table><tr><th rowspan="3">Level of AIM<br /><br /> <br /><br /></th><th colspan="2">2016</th><th colspan="2">2017</th><th colspan="2">@ Sept 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Allocation</td><td>Outturn</td><td>Allocation</td><td>Outturn</td><td>Allocation</td><td>Outturn</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Level 4</td><td>5.40 </td><td>4.24 </td><td>10.10 </td><td>4.42 </td><td>6.00 </td><td>4.42 </td></tr><tr><td>Level 5</td><td>1.61 </td><td>0.12 </td><td>2.50</td><td>3.07 </td><td>2.50 </td><td>1.39 </td></tr><tr><td>Level 6</td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>Level 7</td><td>5.43 </td><td>1.83 </td><td>15.41 </td><td>11.40 </td><td>12.00 </td><td>8.30 </td></tr></table>The number of distinct children benefitting from AIM in each programme year by county division AIM 2018 figures as at 27.9.2018<table><tr><th></th><th colspan="4"><div>AIM 2016</div></th><th colspan="4"><div>AIM 2017</div></th><th colspan="4"><div>AIM 2018 (to date)</div></th></tr><tr><td>County Division</td><td>Level 4</td><td>Level 5 Alterations</td><td>Level 5 Equipment</td><td>Level 7</td><td>Level 4</td><td>Level 5 Alterations</td><td>Level 5 Equipment</td><td>Level 7</td><td>Level 4</td><td>Level 5 Alterations</td><td>Level 5 Equipment</td><td>Level 7</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>30</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>52</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>48</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>55</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>32</td><td>46</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>64</td><td>25</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>95</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>64</td><td>97</td><td>5</td><td>13</td><td>110</td><td>30</td><td>6</td><td>14</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Cork -

It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted.  The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.  In addition to the tens of thousands of children who have benefitted from universal supports under AIM, more than 6,000 children with more complex disabilities have so far benefitted from targeted supports.</p><p>Of the seven levels of support provided through AIM, Level 7 involves recruitment of additional staff by providers of ECCE services.  I am aware of the difficulties reported by some providers in recruiting staff under Level 7 of AIM.  I am seeking incrementally additional investment to address this issue and to address the wider issue of attracting and retaining staff across the early years sector.  I acknowledge that pay and conditions are major issues that impact on recruitment and retention of staff. </p><p>  While my Department is not the employer of childcare workers, it does continue to invest significant resources in the early years sector.  In the last three budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in the early years sector has increased by figures approaching 80%, which reflects the emphasis being placed on developing quality services with appropriately supported staff.</p><p>From September 2018 capitation rates to childcare providers for the provision of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme increased by 7%, which is intended to support the workforce.  The increase in capitation is targeted at increasing the quality of care and education provided through ECCE and, in particular, supporting the recruitment and retention of high quality staff.</p><p>  Further, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills has committed to delivering a new workforce plan for the early years sector.

It has been decided to use the terms 'founded' and 'unfounded' to keep in line with international best practice.</p><p>In Children First, 2011, Section 5.5,  &lsquo;Unfounded Concerns&rsquo;, provides guidance on actions to be taken where, after an assessment or appeals process, concerns or suspicions of child abuse are considered as &lsquo;unfounded.&rsquo;</p><p>A &lsquo;founded&rsquo; assessment is an authentication that a judgement has been made that evidence exists which confirms that child abuse occurred. </p><p>  An &lsquo;unfounded&rsquo; assessment is one where the evidence does not support a finding of abuse.  It does not mean the abuse did not occur, rather that there is a lack of evidence to support a &lsquo;founded&rsquo; outcome.  For example, there may be no convincing disclosure, no clear evidence, no witnesses, and/or no admission on the part of the Person Subject to Allegations of Abuse (PSAA).</p><p>  The &lsquo;balance of probabilities&rsquo; is interpreted as the degree to which something is more likely to have occurred than not.</p><p>The key principles informing decision-making when an assessment is being made  include the following:</p><p>a.  The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration.</p><p>b.  The requirements of Children First must be met.</p><p>c.  Tulsa must determine and assess any current or future risk to a child.</p><p>d.  If a child is deemed to be at immediate serious risk the child's interest takes priority over the suspected person&rsquo;s right to be informed of allegations against him/her.</p><p>e.  If Tusla concludes there is an immediate serious risk to a child, this must be communicated to an appropriate relevant third party to enable Tusla to take whatever protective action is necessary.</p><p>f.  Maintaining children in their own home is in their best interests. If the child is living with an alleged abuser, the safety of the child is paramount.</p><p>g.  Social work professionals make a determination on a balance of probabilities.</p><p>h.  Natural justice and fair procedures must be applied in relation to persons suspected of abuse, including their right to be informed about allegations against them and to respond.</p><p>i.  A Tusla assessment should take representations made by a person suspected of abuse into account.</p><p>j.  Any action or protection plan should be signed off by all relevant parties, including the person suspected of abuse, where possible.</p><p>k.  A person suspected of abuse has a right to have their data protection rights protected, to obtain legal advice, to see all relevant documentation, to submit relevant documentation, to make oral or written submissions and have these considered, to identify any third parties with relevant information for Tusla consideration for interview, and to request an independent review of the assessment undertaken by the social worker.</p></reply>

One of these is the State pension (contributory), qualification for which is based on a number of criteria, including that a minimum of 520 qualifying contributions have been paid into the Social Insurance Fund.  People who have not made such contributions are generally paid alternative payments, if they are not in receipt of a Public Service pension.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo;, published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520, and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997.  These changes reflected the very significant increase in PRSI coverage which had taken place over the previous decades, which made it easier for people to pay into the Social Insurance Fund for at least 10 years between the age of 16 and retirement.</p>  <p>  It is generally considered reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years' paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over the span of 50 years of working age life.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC) because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory), which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC.  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension at pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Awarding them a state pension would take resources away from other pensioners, most of whom either have contributed into the Social Insurance Fund most of their adult life, and/or are solely dependent upon the State pension, and have less means than the group who would benefit from such a change.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that the marriage bar describes a rule that existed in most of the public service, and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  As it was a rule rather than a general legal prohibition against employing married women, they could either return to work or take up other work, and many did.  It is also worth remembering that most public servants recruited prior to 1995 are not entitled to the State pension, regardless of gender and marital status.  Therefore, the marriage bar would not generally have negatively impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  The implications it had for public service pensions are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-02a.1537.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100200083#WRDD04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 and 591 together.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised the concerns of individuals who are self-employed in relation to access to illness benefit payments from my Department.  It should be noted that where an individual, whether employed or self-employed, does not qualify for a benefit payment based on their social insurance contribution status or history, my Department may be able to assist in other ways.  For example, self-employed contributors can apply for a means-tested jobseeker's benefit payment or seek assistance from their Community Welfare Officer.</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55-year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  The fund is expected to return to a deficit situation in coming years as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers would be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction was factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.</p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue-neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p>  <p>  I hope this information is helpful.</p></reply>

In my response of last week to the particular representations made by the Deputy I explained a number of key points in relation to the Bill. </p>  <p>  Firstly, it is important to understand that we are not saying that all casual or flexible working arrangements are wrong and should be stopped.  The flexibility offered by genuine casual work can be mutually beneficial for employees and employers.  This is recognised in the Bill, which prohibits zero hours contracts in most circumstances but it is not an outright prohibition.  Employers will be permitted to use zero hour contracts in limited circumstances, including in respect of casual work.  In this regard there is no change to the existing law, Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, as it applies to casual work.  The term &ldquo;work of a casual nature&rdquo; has been used in Section 18 of the 1997 Act for over twenty years and has not caused problems.  The WRC and Labour Court are capable of determining if work is casual or not, should an employee pursue such a case. </p>  <p>  Secondly, it is important to understand the rationale for the banded hours provision, which is to ensure that workers on low hour contracts, who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment, are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that better reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over an extended period.  Under this provision an employee must request to be placed in a band of hours.  Employees are only entitled to be placed on a band of hours that reflects what they actually worked over the previous 12 months.  There are four robust defences for employers to refuse an employee&rsquo;s request:</p>  <p>  1. If there is no evidence to support the claim i.e. the employee worked less hours than claimed.</p>  <p>  2. Where there has been a significant adverse change to the business e.g. an organic grower losing a contract with a supermarket.</p>  <p>  3. Emergency circumstances e.g. a flood.</p>  <p>  4. When the average hours worked by the employee during the reference period were affected by a temporary situation that no longer exists e.g. covering a maternity leave.</p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that a person placed on a band of hours is expected to work those hours i.e. they do not get paid for hours that they do not work. </p>  <p>  To take account of seasonal work, the Banded Hours provision does not require an employer to offer hours of work in a week where the employee was not expected to work or require an employer to offer hours of work in a week where the employer&rsquo;s business is not being carried out &ndash; see Section 16 of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (subsection 13 of new section 18A to be inserted into the 1997 Act). </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the definition of employee does not change on foot of the Bill.  If the inspectors employed by the Irish Organic Association currently meet the definition of employee within the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 or  the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, they will continue to be regarded as employees under those Acts  when the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is enacted.</p>  <p>  For all the above reasons, I do not consider that the exemption sought by the IAO is necessary or appropriate.</p></reply>

The conditions include progressing in the level of education held by an applicant with reference to the national framework of qualifications.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of instances where the progression rule may be waived.  For instance, where a person holds a Level 5 or Level 6, the progression rule can be waived if their previous qualification was obtained three years prior to re-entry into education and applicant satisfies the other BTEA criteria. The course must also be deemed to enhance a person&rsquo;s job prospects. If the Deputy has a particular case, they should request my Department to examine the specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to note that the purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels so as to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one. </p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to change the current rules for progression at this time. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It should be noted that where an individual, whether employed or self employed, does not qualify for a benefit payment based on their social insurance contribution status or history, my Department may be able to assist in other ways.  For example self employed contributors can apply for a means tested jobseeker's benefit payment or seek assistance from their Community Welfare Officer.</p>  <p>   Self-employed workers, who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  The fund is expected to return to a deficit situation in coming years as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers would be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction was factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The individual in question could make contact with her local Intreo office, to establish if she qualifies for a means tested payment, such as jobseekers' allowance, or for other supports available from my department. </p>  <p>  I hope this information is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Building Regulations is to protect the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings. Part B of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations deals with Fire Safety.</p>  <p>  Building defects, including fire safety defects, are in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, management companies, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners. Where problems cannot be resolved through dialogue or mediation it may be necessary to seek enforcement through the courts. In cases where the developer is in receivership, any defects should be brought to the attention of the receiver as soon as possible.  Where homeowners are concerned that due to defects in their home there may be a risk to Health and Safety, advice should be sought from a competent professional. </p>  <p>  In addition, when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire. In multi-unit developments, the "person having control" is generally the Owner Management Company.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, set out the means by which problems relating to the ownership and management of the common areas of both existing and new multi-unit developments can be addressed.  The Act also aims to facilitate the fair and effective management of those bodies responsible for the management of such areas.

In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Valuation Office that the part of the National Revaluation Programme known as REVAL2019 commenced in October 2017 with the signing of Valuation Orders for Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow rating authority areas. The new valuations for the eight areas undergoing revaluation will be published in 2019, and become effective for rates purposes from 2020 onwards.  Revaluation 2019 will result in the revaluation of approximately 31,000 commercial and industrial properties. This includes the Fingal County Council rating authority area which is undergoing a second Revaluation.</p>  <p>  One of the first steps of REVAL2019 was that a request for information, under Section 46 of the Valuation Act 2001 (as amended), was issued in October last year to each rateable property in each of the local authority rating areas being revalued. The information sought included details of occupation, whether the property was held leasehold or freehold, the nature of business being carried out in the property and the physical size of the property.  The occupier of the property referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question received such a request and provided the relevant information in January this year.</p>  <p>  As part of the revaluation process, I am advised by the Valuation Office that it requests more detailed information in respect of certain types of business including fuel/oil depots. This is provided for in Section 45 of the Valuation Act 2001 (as amended). This information can include information on the company&rsquo;s accounts certified by a suitably qualified individual such as an accountant. </p>  <p>  The information requested by way of a Section 45 Notice is normally more trade related and commercially sensitive than that requested under Section 46. In this regard, a significant number of requests for information under Section 45 have issued in recent months, including to the occupier of the property referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. The occupier has been in contact with the Valuation Office to advise that the relevant information will be provided later this month.</p>  <p>  Conducting a revaluation is an extensive, evidence-based statutory process principally governed by the procedures and timelines set out in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 with the express objective of achieving both &ldquo;Correctness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Equity &amp;amp; Uniformity&rdquo; for ratepayers. The information provided by occupiers is highly significant in supporting this objective.</p></reply>

One of the main criteria underpinning the MTR scheme is that it is a social housing option and therefore is targeted at those borrowers in arrears who qualify for social housing support as prescribed by the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual housing authorities to assess a household's income for social housing support eligibility in accordance with the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 which prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.  </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements. </p><p>These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position in the near future to publish the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

The current options available to local authorities for Part V delivery are:</p><p>- the transfer of ownership of land, subject to the planning permission application, to a local authority for the provision of social housing remains the default option as is currently the case. The land option must be acceptable to the local authority, as well as the developer; </p><p>- the building and transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social housing units on the site subject to the planning permission; </p><p>- the transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social housing units on other land; </p><p>- the Part V obligation can now be fulfilled by developers through long term leasing of properties; and</p><p>- a combination of the options above.</p><p>Since 2015, the Part V condition must require that the agreement be entered into prior to the lodging of a commencement notice. This is a significant change, which should frontload the delivery of social housing units to the local authority. There is nothing to prevent local authorities acquiring further units in a development outside of Part V, subject to any relevant policies and the agreement of my Department to funding for such units. </p><p>With regard to future delivery of Part V homes, my Department formerly gathered statistical information on Part V agreements &ldquo;in progress&rdquo;, which can be found here: .</p><p>Many Part V agreements are, however, not fully actioned, as some planning permissions are not fully exercised. In addition, local authorities do not have control over the timing of Part V delivery on private developments and, therefore, this data could not be used as a reliable indicator of future delivery. However, it is estimated that, nationally, 590 Part V units will be delivered in 2018 and 1,100 in 2019.</p></reply>

The primary focus of programmes initially is in areas of high housing demand, and with a secondary focus of town and village renewal, improving public realm and regeneration of the Historic core in Limerick City. Staff are carrying out surveys of their districts with reference to Census and GeoDirectory information, identifying residential properties which may be targeted under the Buy and Renew and Repair and Lease Schemes.  These schemes have been advertised locally, and are being proactively promoted on the ground with staff linking with community groups, voluntary housing associations and encouraging citizen participation in identifying vacant properties. Information on vacant property is being collated and mapped, in order to generate a picture of real vacancy. Vacancy Officers provide advice and assistance and linkages to other colleagues in the Council utilising all mechanisms available to address vacancy and bring properties back into use. </p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council carried out a City Centre Health Check (in 5 City Centre Electoral Districts) during January 2018. This analysis indicates that the number of vacant commercial city centre properties was 943 (46% of the total commercial properties) and the number of vacant residential properties was 357 (representing 8% of the total residential properties in this area). </p>  <p>  The Council is one of six local authorities that volunteered to participate in an ongoing vacancy pilot field survey, and has visually inspected areas within their administrative area which have been identified as being more likely to contain vacant dwellings based on the data sets available. Those dwellings identified by the Council as potentially vacant will be targeted with a view to identifying and engaging with the owners to advise them of the options available to them should they wish to bring their homes back into use.</p>  <p>  All local authorities will continue to work on identifying recoverable residential homes as they have already been doing. This work may include carrying out desktop data drilling exercises (into CSO/GeoDirectory statistics), &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; inspections and subsequent identification of / engagement with property owners, with the aim of reactivating the greatest number of recoverable dwellings into the liveable housing stock.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks. Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector. The earliest date a HAP payment will be payable to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manage all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month. </p>  <p>  The HAP scheme has been structured in a way that most protects the Exchequer funding by ensuring that payment issues only on valid and complete applications. For this reason rent is paid in arrears and ensures that money is only paid in respect of time that the property has actually been occupied by the tenant. This practice also avoids a situation where the local authority has to attempt to recover money from the landlord and simplifies the administration of the scheme. It is recognised that certain landlords seek rent in advance; however, the benefit of the HAP scheme is that it offers a security of regular monthly payment for the landlord from the SSC. </p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 2 2018, there were more than 37,700 active tenancies in receipt of HAP support and  over 21,000 separate landlords and agents involved in providing accommodation to those households. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. </p></reply>

While my Department does not have a breakdown of the total flows of philanthropic funding to the sector, the Programme for a Partnership Government does contain a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills.  In this regard, I recognise the important work carried out by Business to Arts for which my Department provides a small amount of assistance.</p><p>In addition, the Arts Council, which is funded by the Department, operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.  It is designed to assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.</p><p>In terms of other capital investment requiring co-funding, a &euro;10 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres is in progress, focused on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.

This included an additional &euro;2.8 m for the Arts Council; an additional &euro;1.7 m across all of the National Cultural Institutions; almost &euro;1 m additional funding for the Heritage programme and an extra &euro;1.4 m for the 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council, the main Irish Government agency for developing the arts, works in partnership with and provides funding for arts, artists, arts organisations, public policy makers and others to build a central place for the arts in Irish life.  Festivals, and cultural events are important in this context and the Arts Council received &euro;68 m in funding from my Department in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the work of the Arts Council, the Creative Ireland Programme is a high level, high ambition, 5-year initiative, from 2017 to 2022 which aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy.  The programme is being led by my Department in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations (including the National Cultural Institutions) and relevant NGOs.</p>  <p>  As part of the Creative Ireland Programme, each of the 31 local authorities has established a Culture Team and in 2017 published and implemented local Culture and Creativity Plans which were supported by an allocation of &euro;2 m (&euro;1 m from my Department and &euro;1 m from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government).  In total, these plans listed over 750 local cultural projects, events and initiatives taking place nationwide last year which gave us a snapshot of the rich cultural activity taking place in each country. </p>  <p>  On 12 September, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, and myself as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht launched 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Strategies.  These ambitious and innovative 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategies have been developed by the network of expert and passionate Culture Teams within the 31 Local Authorities, in consultation with artists, creatives, cultural and heritage organisations, community groups, the creative industries, centres of education and schools across the country.  The Strategies embody both the spirit and practice of collaboration and shared purpose, which is at the heart of the Creative Ireland Programme.  They aim to provide meaningful opportunities for citizens and local communities, together with our Local Authorities, to build, nurture and sustain our creative society. Each local authority will receive approximately &euro;96,000 this year under the Creative Ireland Programme. </p>  <p>  Another significant step in the delivery process has been Project Ireland 2040 which gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage to our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.  This recognition is underpinned by the unprecedented commitment by Government to invest &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, our language and our heritage - Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage.  The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next 10 years prioritised across 3 areas - &euro;785 m for Culture; &euro;295 m for Heritage and &euro;178 m for our Language.  </p>  <p>  This level of investment will transform our cultural and heritage infrastructure right across the country and will support the development of employment opportunities across these sectors.</p></reply>

Maintenance of such monuments is undertaken on my behalf by the Office of Public Works.  The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Local authorities are responsible under the Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  </p>  <p>  My Department records all reports of damage to recorded monuments.  Such reports usually emanate from members of the public, local authorities or heritage-based NGOs.  </p>  <p>  My Department also liaises regularly with the utility and infrastructure providers and has agreed codes of practice with a number of these agencies aimed at safeguarding archaeological sites and monuments.  In addition, awareness programmes are in place with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and farm organisations that are aimed at raising awareness in relation to farming and archaeology.</p>  <p>  My function as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to archaeological excavation is to regulate this activity through the licensing system under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  So far this year 1002 such licences and related regulatory instruments have been issued.  The majority of such archaeological excavations are carried out by private sector archaeological consultants for the purpose of assessing the impact of proposed development on possible archaeological features or mitigating the impact of development on archaeological heritage.  A much smaller number are carried out for conservation or research purposes.  In deciding whether to grant an archaeological excavation licence, appropriate consideration is given to the need to maintain the integrity of affected archaeological sites.  All archaeological excavation licences are granted subject to conditions requiring the excavations to be conducted to an appropriate standard and that reports on the results are furnished to my Department's National Monuments Service.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, as a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015 whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made, as appropriate, to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of historical or cultural sites.  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  The Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to all recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to, at or in the vicinity of a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give the Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures that are on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. The scheme supports heritage projects across the country and creates employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas, and is co-ordinated by each local authority.   My Department has allocated &euro;2m under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018, of which &euro;50,000 is the indicative amount for County Kildare.</p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  My Department has allocated &euro;1,324,000 under the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. Local authorities submitted related applications to my Department and the successful applicants were notified by their local authority last April. I understand that three applications have been approved for County Kildare to the value of &euro;22,000 in each case.</p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Structures at Risk Fund are now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who are implementing both schemes throughout 2018.</p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities.  They are also a research and educational resource.</p>  <p>  Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service my Department also manages a property portfolio of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. They are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; that play a vital role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s own success rate is above the EU average at 18.9% </p><p>Under the Creative Europe &ndash; Culture Sub-Programme there is no dedicated funding strand for festivals.

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive.  This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme, including relocation where feasible, for affected turf cutters.</p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed, including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of article 6 of the Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014, has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This entails the cessation of turf cutting on 36 natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 sites) as of 1 January 2017, the de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 sites) and the designation of 25 new sites as natural heritage areas.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 Review, has been presented to the D&aacute;il and is proceeding through the necessary stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  15,417 annual payments and 1,076 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation.  1,109 annual payments and 2 deliveries of turf have been made to applicants from raised bog natural heritage areas under the scheme.  In addition, 1,870 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made, of which 48 relate to natural heritage areas.</p>  <p>  Relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs is a complex process.  Notwithstanding this, progress in relocation has been achieved in a number of cases.  In addition, my Department is moving forward in the relocation process.  It is envisaged that the necessary infrastructure and drainage works will be completed at 3 relocation sites by the end of 2018.  Work in ongoing, primarily, within the various stages of the planning process with a view to undertaking these works at another 5 sites.</p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>
