She has served during what has been a period of considerable change and challenge in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive in January 2020 with Arlene Foster as First Minister and Michelle O&rsquo;Neill as deputy First Minister was a key development in supporting peace and stability for all the people of these islands.</p>  <p>  I send my best wishes to Arlene and her family for the future.</p>  <p>  On the 9th of April, I had phone calls with First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill. We discussed the current unrest on the streets in Northern Ireland and related issues. We agreed that there was no excuse for violence and the attacks on police officers and others. I stressed the need for ongoing dialogue and support for the peace process and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I also welcomed the Statement from the Northern Ireland Executive published on 8th April condemning the violence and unrest on the streets. We agreed to keep in close contact on developments.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that discussions are continuing between the EU and the UK regarding aspects of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol.  I am hopeful that the current discussions will lead to mutually agreed arrangements which in turn will contribute to effective implementation of the protocol.</p>  <p>  As previously outlined to the D&aacute;il, I have also spoken with the First and deputy First Ministers on a number of occasions, in particular regarding Covid-19 and our respective approaches to the implementation of, and easing of, restrictions.</p></reply>

On foot of this Government approval, I am keen to advance this legislation as quickly as possible and have now requested the Chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to consider pre-legislative scrutiny at the Committee's earliest convenience.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the General Scheme provides for the establishment of the Office of Directly Elected Mayor with executive functions and for the transfer of existing executive functions to that office. In addition to existing functions, new areas of responsibility are also provided for in the General Scheme, including provisions requiring the Mayor to lead a local board to advance the implementation of Project Ireland 2040 in the Limerick city region and convene a rural board to examine all aspects of rural life in Limerick.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that officials at my Department continue to engage intensively with our legal advisors on this very important piece of legislation and are very focussed on progressing the legislation, as quickly as possible. It is intended that the election will be held as soon as is practicable following the completion of the legislative process, guided of course by the public health advice in place at the time.</p></reply>

It had been requested that local authorities ensure that such possible burial sites are identified and taken into account in the context of future developments.  </p>  <p> As my letter of 27th April sets out, the preparation of statutory development plans is a central function of each planning authority and must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In that context, where there is any evidence of such burial sites, I am satisfied that there are provisions in the 2000 Act which enable local authorities in their role as planning authority, to take a precautionary approach in addressing this matter and to properly safeguard any such sites from potentially harmful development. </p>  <p>  Currently, almost every local authority has commenced, or is scheduled to shortly commence, the statutory review of their development plan in accordance with Section 11 of the Act.  This process affords the opportunity for the identification of burial grounds and their subsequent protection from future development through appropriate policy and objectives in the county or city development plan, and which importantly includes several opportunities for public participation and consultation.   </p>  <p>   I believe the development plan process therefore provides an appropriate opportunity for important local knowledge to be applied to assist in the identification and subsequent protection of such burial grounds.</p></reply>

Specifically, I am acutely aware of the issue of diverse levels and standards of communications between the fisheries and ORE industries, having first been raised by members of the fisheries community at a National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) public consultation meeting in Arklow held on 10 February 2020, which was one of a number of NMPF public consultation events held by the Department during 2019 and early 2020.</p><p>To directly address these concerns, and also with the wider aim of promoting constructive engagement and consultation between the fisheries community and the ORE industry, I have instructed my Department officials to commence the formation of a Seafood/ORE working group, with the initial aim of agreeing a communications protocol between these two strategically important Marine sectors. </p><p>During the last 6 months of 2020, and including the early months of this year, constructive discussions and consultations on the draft terms of reference have been held between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and other relevant public sector bodies, and are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.  Advice on International best practice has also been sought from, and consulted on, with neighbouring Maritime jurisdictions with experience in Fisheries/ORE Industry liaison. </p><p>Unfortunately, the  commencement of this group has been delayed due to a number of factors, including Covid-related restrictions and the prioritisation of the finalisation process of the NMPF, and the Maritime Area Planning Bill, but my Department intends to commence the Seafood/ORE working group before the end of Q2 2021.  Representatives of NIFA and NIFO will be invited to participate in the working group, and I look forward to their constructive input.</p><p>It is the intention that the proposed Seafood/ORE group will, in time, address issues such as dislocation, co-existence, the impact of developments (including exploration of development sites) and the formalising of a consultation/engagement process.</p><p>My Department has not yet formulated a definitive<b></b>position with regard to the issue of the appointment of an independent arbitrator, as suggested by NIFA and NIFO, but is giving further consideration to the points raised in those public submissions as the NMPF moves toward the Implementation stages. My Department will also be informed by the reports and suggested outcomes of the Seafood/ORE working group.  I do not wish to pre-empt the outcomes of any working group discussions on this point, and so there are no plans in place to appoint an arbitrator. Given their functional remit over fisheries and offshore renewables policy respectively, I will also consult with my colleagues the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Environment, Climate and Communications, should the need arise.</p><p>Notwithstanding the inception of the aforementioned group, and any formal consultation or engagement guidelines that may be subsequently developed by that group, my Department has worked across Government and with marine stakeholders to ensure the interests and rights of the fisheries community are clearly stated and represented in the Fisheries policy approach of the draft NMPF, in a way that complements other areas of fisheries management. Fisheries Policy 1 states that;</p><p><b><i>&lsquo;&rsquo;Proposals that may have significant adverse impacts on access for existing fishing activities, must demonstrate that they will, in order of preference: a) avoid, b) minimise, or c) mitigate such impacts.</i></b></p><p><b><i>If it is not possible to mitigate significant adverse impacts on fishing activity, the public benefits for proceeding with the proposal that outweigh the significant adverse impacts on existing activities must be demonstrated.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></b></p><p>While Fisheries Policy 5 states;</p><p>&lsquo;<b><i>&rsquo;Where significant impact upon fishing activity is identified, a Fisheries Management and Mitigation Strategy should be prepared by the proposer of development or use, in consultation with local fishing interests (and other interests as appropriate) in the development of the Strategy. All efforts should be made to agree the Strategy with those interests. Those interests should also undertake to engage with the proposer and provide best available, transparent and accurate information and data in a timely manner to help complete the Strategy. The Strategy should be drawn up as part of the discharge of conditions of permissions granted.</i></b></p><p><b><i>The content of the Strategy should be relevant to the particular circumstances and could include:</i></b></p><p><b><i>- An assessment of the potential impact of the development or use on the affected fishery or fisheries, both in socio-economic terms and in terms of environmental sustainability. This assessment should include consideration of any impact upon cultural identity within fishing communities.</i></b></p><p><b><i>- A recognition that the disruption to existing fishing opportunities/activity should be minimised as far as possible. Demonstration of the public benefit(s) that outweigh the significant impacts identified.</i></b></p><p><b><i>- Reasonable measures to mitigate any constraints which the proposed development or use may place on existing or proposed fishing activity.</i></b></p><p><b><i>- Reasonable measures to mitigate any potential impacts on sustainability of fish stocks (e.g. impacts on spawning grounds or areas of fish or shellfish abundance) and any socio-economic impacts.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Where it does not prove possible to agree the Strategy with all interests:</i></b></p><p><b><i>- divergent views and the reasons for any divergence of views between the parties should be fully explained in the Strategy and dissenting views should be given a platform within the Strategy to make their case.</i></b></p><p><b><i>- where divergent views are identified, relevant public authorities should be engaged to identify informal and formal steps designed to enable proposal(s) to progress.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></b></p><p>Fisheries groups were represented on the Marine Spatial Planning Advisory group, which played an important role in informing the development of the Plan. These policies are due to come in to effect on the adoption of the NMPF in Q2 2021, and clearly indicate that developers cannot proceed with operations without due consideration for the impact of their activities on other marine users, with particular regard to the Fisheries community. The way in which Fisheries Policy 5 will be implemented will be a subject for consideration at the Seafood/ORE working group.</p></reply>

This waiver applies to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions. </p>  <p>  The 2021 commercial rates waiver is necessarily more targeted than was the case with the nine month waiver in 2020.  Automatic eligibility is extended to retail, hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, health services and various other categories. In recognition of the fact that there may be ratepayers excluded from the waiver that were severely impacted by the pandemic, it includes a provision that ratepayers not automatically eligible may engage directly with their local authorities, to demonstrate serious financial impact. In such circumstances ratepayers that are not automatically eligible, may also qualify. These applications are being reviewed by local authorities on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The processing of the 2020 commercial rates waiver has been completed.  My Department recouped a total of &euro;729m to local authorities in respect of rates waived in 2020.  The administration by local authorities of the 2021 waiver for the first half of this year is ongoing. </p>  <p>  As with all public health measures and associated supports, the waiver of commercial rates will be kept under review. As has been the case since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic.</p></reply>

In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% per annum. The annual rent increase restriction applies to both new and existing tenancies, irrespective of a change of landlord.</p><p>Not all properties in RPZs are subject to the 4% restriction. </p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;</p><p>or</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning. A protected structure is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 Act provides a legal definition of &lsquo;substantial change in the nature of rental accommodation&rsquo; to illustrate the type of works to be carried out to a rental property to qualify for an exemption from the annual rent increase restriction applicable in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).</p><p>Such works shall result in:</p><p>- a permanent extension increasing the floor area by 25%; or</p><p>- an improvement in the Building Energy Rating (BER) by at least 7 ratings; or </p><p>- at least 3 of the following:</p><p>-- a permanent alteration of the internal layout;  </p><p>-- adaptations for a person with a disability;  </p><p>-- a permanent increase in the number of rooms;  </p><p>-- an improvement in the BER by 3 or more ratings where the original BER was D1 or lower; or  </p><p>-- an improvement in the BER by 2 or more ratings where the original BER was C3 or higher.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 do not stipulate a maximum or minimum rent amount to be charged in an area and places no obligation on a landlord to charge a rent. Section 19 of the Acts prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds the prevailing market rent. There is no legal obstacle to landlords reducing rents in an RPZ or elsewhere in the country.</p><p>During the pandemic, landlords are being urged to show forbearance to tenants with regard to the levels of rent payable and any arrangements that might be made should rent arrears arise. It is open to the parties to agree informal temporary rental arrangements during the pandemic and this does not contravene RPZ legislation. Such arrangements are viewed as a pragmatic response to the temporary impacts of Covid-19, lowering rents for tenants when most needed.</p><p>In order better enforce RPZ legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with enhanced powers and resources to carry out investigations and to sanction landlords if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs. The maximum sanction is &euro;30,000.  Alternatively, a tenant may wish to refer a dispute for resolution to the RTB and a lawful rent can be enforced and damages of up to &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</p><p>My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keeps the operation of the rental market under review.  It is important to have rent transparency and a rental system with fair rent and certainty for tenants.  I intend to bring forward comprehensive rental legislation in the Autumn with provisions to address long term security of tenure, rent levels and the impact of on-line platforms taking units out of the rental market.  The matter raised will be examined in the context of that legislation.</p></reply>

My Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities already offer a blended model for the payment of commercial rates, allowing ratepayers to pay using a selection of the following methods: recurring card payments; payment in person; standing order/direct debit; secure internet payment; electronic banking; and payment by telephone.</p>  <p>  Sections, 4, 5 and 10 of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019, when commenced, will allow for the wider operation of the commercial rates system (such as billing) by electronic means, providing greater convenience and efficiency for both ratepayers and local authorities.  Progress on commencing the Act has been delayed due to the impact of the COVID crisis and ongoing work on the government funded rates waiver. Plans to amend and commence the legislation and introduce requisite regulations are temporarily delayed, with the revised aim of commencing the Act in 2021 and signature of prescribed regulations in 2022.</p>  <p>  The ePlanning project currently in development seeks to integrate the IT systems of the 31 planning authorities using a single online portal allowing for the online submission of planning applications, appeals, submissions and associated fees.  Once fully rolled out, ePlanning will provide an online option for the public to engage with the planning system, in addition to the paper based system.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is managing and co-ordinating the development of the ePlanning project on behalf of my Department.  The experience of operating the planning system during the Covid19 pandemic has highlighted the important role that online technology could make in the future. The proposed system is now in its final stages of development and testing, following which it is envisaged that the LGMA's rollout of ePlanning nationwide to all local authorities will be completed on a phased basis by Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted in this context that planning authorities are required under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 38) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 180 of 2020) to upload planning applications and related documentation onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt or, where exceptional circumstances exist, as soon as practicable thereafter. These measures enable members of the public to view documentation online and at planning offices, and facilitate planning applications, appeals or other submissions to be made during the Level 5 restrictions. These arrangements may include provision for attendance at planning offices by appointment so that public health and social distancing requirements can be observed by both staff and customers.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes a commitment to deliver 50,000 new social homes with a focus on new build homes.  </p>  <p>  In January, the enhanced Level 5 restrictions introduced by Government involved most residential construction being halted from 8 January until 12 April.  Certain essential social housing projects, which were scheduled for completion by 30 April were allowed to continue.  This has ensured that social housing continued to be delivered during the first four months of the year.  However, the restrictions have involved delays on the majority of housing projects. </p>  <p>  It is vital that the supply of housing is accelerated for the remainder of the year and I have been engaging with stakeholders in this regard.  I have asked all local authorities to engage with developers, contractors and Approved Housing Bodies to take all possible measures to maximise delivery for the remainder of the year.  I have issued a circular to local authorities granting extended discretion in relation to construction working hours, with a view to assisting the construction sector to compensate for lost output.  Last week, I also announced further measures to support social housing delivery. This includes a voids programme to provide funding to local authorities to remediate approximately 3,000 vacant properties; an increased focus on Buy and Renew construction to repurpose vacant and underutilised properties as social homes, and a programme of targeted acquisitions. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work closely with stakeholders through the year to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to maximise the delivery of housing.</p></reply>

The first of these entails the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities.  To support this, under the Serviced Sites Fund, &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of &euro;198 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes.</p><p>All Serviced Sites Fund proposals are assessed on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities, which are required to verify local affordability challenges, project viability, and the ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.  Whilst an application for Serviced Sites funding has not been made by Mayo County Council to date, it is open to the Council to do so should it identify an affordable housing challenge and the viability to deliver homes against the above-mentioned criteria.</p><p>Separately, a new National Affordable Purchases Shared Equity scheme is currently being designed for private developments.  My intention is that this measure will be available nationally.  It will help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake purchased by the State, between the maximum mortgage available to eligible households and the price of the new home they wish to buy.The objective of the scheme will be to increase housing supply by activating viable planning permissions and to enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford sooner than would otherwise be the case.  </p><p>The detailed provisions to operationalise both of these schemes will be contained within a new housing Bill which I intended to bring to the Oireachtas in the very near future to allow their commencement this year.</p><p>In the meantime both the Help to Buy and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan remain available to eligible purchasers to make the cost of housing more affordable.</p></reply>

The issue of sale and of purchase of land or housing are matters for the Minister for Justice.  I am working with my Government colleagues to bring forward comprehensive proposals to address this issue as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  I would note that institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the housing market which based on the last census in 2016 was more than 2 million houses and apartments.  Industry estimates suggest that the total number of residential units under institutional ownership in Ireland was approximately 15,550 at the end of 2020,  less than 1% of the total housing stock.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy. </p>  <p>  The presence of such institutional investors in the market helps to increase the supply of housing, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. This is essential to reaching the National Planning Framework targets and to support more sustainable living generally. However the possibility of a trend of investment emerging where already or nearly completed traditional family home estates are purchased in bulk is deeply concerning and not in line with Government policy.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 4 May last, I received Government approval for the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which I will shortly be bringing before the Oireachtas.  A key aspect of this Bill is the reform of Part V of the Planning and Development Act by increasing the existing 10% obligation for social housing in residential developments to a 20% obligation for social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise the increase in the supply of homes and supports which enable first time buyers access their own home.</p></reply>

On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure alone.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for more affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites.

The timeframe for the delivery of such projects entails the detailed design, consultation, planning, procurement and construction phases which, depending on the scale and scope of the project, can take a number of years.</p><p>With regard to the Oscar Traynor Road project, in light of the decision by Dublin City Councillors on 16<sup></sup>November 2020 not to proceed with the transfer of this land for this project, in accordance with Section 183 of the Local Government Act, 2001, I understand that the Executive is now engaging with the various parties on the Council to establish an agreed position as to how the site might be best developed.

Two such programmes that AHBs progress construction projects through are the Capital Advance Loan Facility and the Capital Assistance Scheme. AHBs are making an important contribution to social housing delivery, as envisaged under current Government policy. </p><p>To provide transparency on the new social housing projects being advanced, each quarter my Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity.

A further communication in respect of the 2021 voids programme will issue to all local authorities shortly.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.</p></reply>

In accordance with statutory provisions, I intend to appoint a new temporary Chief Executive to Galway County Council with effect from 24 May 2021.</p>  <p>  In the intervening period, there has been extensive policy development processes examining optimum arrangements for local governance in Galway. Arising from these processes, in June 2018 the Government decided in principle to implement the unanimous recommendation of the Expert Advisory Group to amalgamate Galway City and County Councils by 2021.</p>  <p>  In order to progress matters, the Local Government Bill 2018 contained provision for a single chief executive post with dual responsibility for Galway City and County Councils, to, inter alia, progressively implement organisational integration in advance of a full merger. However, these provisions were removed from the Bill through an amendment approved in the Seanad.</p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, it has been deemed appropriate to review the position in relation to the filling of the post of Chief Executive of Galway County Council on a permanent basis.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Government approved priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 on 22 December 2020, the General Scheme of which I published on 20 January last.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme is designed to help bridge the gap, through providing equity support, between the mortgage a household may have access to and the price of the new home they wish to buy. The measure will enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, increase housing supply, and help restore confidence in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  In availing of the scheme there is no borrowing requirement beyond that already permitted under the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro-prudential rules.  The support provided is in the form of shared equity rather than a loan to households. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, officials from my Department and the Department of Finance have been engaging with the Central Bank to consider the schemes interaction with macro prudential rules as well as the proposed operation of the scheme from the perspective of its consumer protection mandate.  This process will continue until the conclusion of the scheme's design whereupon the Central Bank will take a final position on the matter.</p>  <p>  The Bill has now been approved by Government and I intend to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas in the very near future to allow for the commencement of the Scheme this year.</p></reply>

The Affordable Housing Bill 2020 will ensure that affordability is put at the heart of the housing system and will underpin the new local authority led scheme of affordable homes for purchase, an Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme (private lands) and, for renters in Meath and all over Ireland, the introduction of a new national Cost Rental scheme. </p>  <p>  This year will also see the first ever cost rental units, more than 400 units, built and occupied in the State. Cost rental is targeted at moderate income households where the rent charged only covers the cost of provision of homes. The Land Development Agency will be put on a statutory footing and given capital to ramp up cost rental provision to the scale needed in counties such as Meath.  </p>  <p>  The Government has, and continues to, put in place enhanced legislative protections for renters during the pandemic. There are targeted protections for renters with evictions bans in place during periods of restricted movement and protections for renters whose income has been impacted by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Building on the urgent Covid-19 rental measures to date, the Government has extended the targeted protections for those tenants whose income has been impacted by Covid-19 from 12 April to 12 July.</p>  <p>  Low-income tenants are disproportionately employed in sectors that have been severely affected by Covid-19 restrictions. Significant State income supports are available to assist tenants to pay their rent including changes to the rent supplement eligibility rules for tenants whose income has been reduced because of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  For any tenants impacted by rent arrears, my Department has published a guidance document, Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 - Guidance for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out the new rental protections for tenants and landlords dealing with rent arrears that succeed those provided under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and provides details on the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords.  The document is available on the RTB's website. </p>  <p>  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and the safety of gas, oil and electrical supply.</p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  In terms of supports for the Rental Sector, on 1 July 2019, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act expanded the role of the Residential Tenancy Board (RTB) to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in certain breaches of the law, defined in the Act as Improper Conduct. This brought about a fundamental change in the operation of the RTB by expanding its regulatory remit.</p>  <p>  The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit can investigate include; failure to comply with RPZ requirements; failure to register a tenancy; a reason given on a notice of termination that is known to be false or misleading; and failure to offer a tenant their tenancy back when certain conditions have been met. The RTB also has the power to apply sanctions if breaches are found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  The RTB has a dedicated I&amp;S Unit with staff who have a collective experience in conducting civil and criminal investigations in other regulatory and enforcement bodies as well as significant internal knowledge of the RTB and the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - 'Our Shared Future', commits to improve the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing Residential Tenancies Board enforcement and examining incentives for long-term leasing. </p>  <p>  Proposals for further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts are currently being developed, for inclusion in the General Scheme of the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill which is expected to be submitted for Government approval in the coming months for approval to proceed to legal drafting. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted by the end of 2021. Long-term letting rights for tenants are being considered in this context.</p></reply>

The NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas and the need to ensure their continued function as places to live, work and invest in. The NPF seeks to encourage their growth and to arrest the decline of areas that have experienced low population growth in recent years. </p><p>Importantly, National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p><p>The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department and this remains valid.</p><p>It is noteworthy that there is strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years &ndash; with more than 25,000 rural house planning permissions granted in last 5 years.  In the same period, more than 90% of that number of rural homes were built, comprising around one in three houses completed in Ireland between 2016 and 2020.</p><p>Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared that will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns in order to avoid over-development of those areas. I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I expect final updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.</p><p>In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas. Under these 2005 Guidelines, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  </p><p>As a statutory requirement, a development plan must be formulated to be consistent with national planning policy, legislative requirements and relevant Ministerial Guidelines. In this regard, the plan must include a core strategy, under Section 10(1A) of the Planning and Development Act, which provides details of the projected population and housing both within and in rural areas outside of settlements within the area of the planning authority. In this regard, an estimate of housing in rural areas outside of town, village or other settlements is required as part of the development plan process.  This is not a &lsquo;cap&rsquo; on rural housing.</p><p>The making of a development plan, and the policies therein, is a reserved function of the elected members of a county or city council. Local elected representatives therefore must consider how best to provide for housing needs for all types of accommodation in their area and prepare appropriate policies to meet that need in their development plan.</p></reply>

It also supports the work of my Department and other Government agencies and Departments who are focused on helping to address fuel poverty. Last month I was pleased to launch a project to trial this innovative technological solution between EnergyCloud and Cl&uacute;id &ndash; our largest Approved Housing Body.  The current project will initially see 50 families benefit; however, it is clear from Cl&uacute;id and EnergyCloud that they have an ambitious target to support families in each of the more than 8,300 Cl&uacute;id properties throughout Ireland. This technology utilises existing infrastructure in the home, such as the hot water tank, to receive surplus renewable energy at times when it is not needed on the energy grid. </p>  <p>  A strong emphasis on fuel poverty and the need to improve thermal performance in the social housing stock remains a priority for my Department, as is evident in the newly revised and enhanced Energy Efficiency Programme for 2021, which has received a substantial increase in annual funding support to assist local authorities in the management and maintenance of their stock.  2021 is the first year of a ten year programme that will see a significant increase and ramping up of retrofitting works over the next number of years, and it will build on the good work already undertaken by local authorities&rsquo; to-date. </p>  <p>  The &euro;65 million investment made available this year for energy retrofitting works, including the Midlands Retrofit Programme, will not only benefit local authorities in assisting them in the upgrade and maintenance of their housing stock, but will more importantly benefit householders in many ways, their homes will be warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable, it will enhance air quality in the home and for those currently using oil or gas they will see a saving on their energy bills,</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government funds a number of residential energy efficiency upgrade schemes. These schemes are operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and include partial grants for individuals that can afford to contribute to the cost of energy efficiency upgrades as well as schemes that provide free energy efficiency improvements for people who are in receipt of certain welfare payments.  Grants are available for a range of measures including insulation, heat pumps, solar panels and integrated heating controls. </p>  <p>  The installation of smart meters is a key enabler for the energy transition to a decarbonised system as outlined in the Climate Action Plan.  The move to upgraded digital meters will bring many benefits for energy customers by enhancing competition, making bills more accurate, providing customers with better information on their energy consumption and empowering them with new tools to make more informed choices about their energy needs. Since September 2019, when ESB Networks commenced the replacement of over 2 million electricity meters, over 250,000 meters have been installed to the end of March 2021.</p>  <p>  We are now on an ambitious and irreversible journey away from fossil fuels to renewables.   We have set ambitious targets for the decarbonisation of our built environment &ndash; these form an integral part of our Climate Action Plan, and we are currently ramping up that ambition to achieve that reduction in emissions.  One significant area we are doing this in is Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB), which now applies to all new buildings. </p>  <p>  Improving energy efficiency will improve the health and comfort of those living in dwelling.</p>  <p>  NZEB will deliver benefits across the three categories of </p>  <p>  - Occupant costs - in terms of energy savings, </p>  <p>  - Occupant wellbeing - in terms of improved indoor air quality and </p>  <p>  - Our planet &ndash; impact on the development of climate change.</p>  <p>  I will continue to ensure that improved energy efficiency and associated amelioration of fuel poverty both in social housing and the private rental sector, will continue to be the focus of attention in the years ahead. This will also provide a platform which supports the development of new enterprises which will enable the transition away from a carbon based society.</p></reply>

Furthermore, under the Local Government Act 2001, arrangements in relation to staffing in each local authority are the responsibility of the relevant Chief Executive of that Authority.  My Department supports fire authorities through general policy setting and preparing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. </p>  <p>  My Department was informed by Roscommon County Council in February 2017 that Castlerea Fire Station had been stood down because of internal staffing issues. Roscommon County Council, and its Chief Executive, as employers, sought to resolve the issues by pursuing grievance, disciplinary and mediation processes over a number of years. These efforts were unsuccessful and it was judged by Roscommon County Council that it was unsafe to mobilise this fire station to emergency incidents.   </p>  <p>  I understand that a decision was made earlier this year not to re-open Castlerea Fire Station and that the local authority members were informed accordingly. My Department is informed that fire risk in the area is being managed by an appropriate arrangement of fire cover response from the network of fire stations in the region, together with statutory and community fire safety measures. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the non-availability of any particular fire station does not mean that fire risk management, including fire service response, is diminished. The systemic approach to fire risk management, which has been the policy in use in this country for a more than a decade, has seen a welcome and steady downward trend in fire losses in Ireland. While each fire death is one too many, the fire death rate per million of population, averaged over three years, stands at 4.2, a figure which is one third of what it was 10 year ago.</p></reply>

This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p>  <p>  Irish Water brought forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme, as part of its Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024 to the Commission for Regulations of Utilities (CRU) for consideration. I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for this programme was approved by the CRU. I also understand that projects are now commencing design, and that investment under the Programme will begin to deliver in the coming years. Irish Water is working with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with the local authority development plans.</p>  <p>  My Department is also considering the matter of waste water infrastructure in villages/settlements not serviced by Irish Water. I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at national level. This will include a baseline survey of all rural local authorities to establish the numbers, size, national distribution and other environmental impacts for villages/settlements that do not have waste water collection and treatment infrastructure provided by Irish Water. I will be in a position to provide further update once I have received this report.</p></reply>

There are a number of supports available from my Department to owners to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p><b>The Repair and Leasing Scheme</b>is available to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. If eligible for the scheme, the property owner can avail of a loan of up to &euro;60,000 from the local authority to carry out the refurbishment of property. </p><p><b>- The Buy and Renew initiative</b>particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community with the added value of delivery social housing units.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased. </p><p>In December 2018, my Department published the <b>Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.  </b></p><p>The Bringing Back Homes manual is aimed at property owners, members of the public, local authorities and stakeholders in the construction industry who are interested in developing vacant buildings. It provides clear and detailed guidance on current policy and regulatory requirements that apply to this form of development. </p><p>The manual also supports the work of the vacant homes offices in local authorities, which create a central point of contact for those interested in developing existing buildings. These offices are a useful resource to assist developers and owners in clarifying the regulatory requirements that exist and how they apply to development, thus reducing uncertainty and complexity but maintaining safe, sustainable and quality standards for homes.</p></reply>

This was an unprecedented measure that offered support to both businesses and local authorities. Of this, &euro;729m was distributed to the 31 local authorities.   </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the distribution of any unspent funds from the overall rates waiver allocation to the local government sector to help minimise the impact of reductions in other local authority income streams and to help meet the costs associated with the response to the pandemic. As a result a further &euro;131m was distributed to the local government sector for 2020. </p>  <p>  In order to continue supporting businesses and ratepayers, and in recognition of the ongoing impacts of COVID 19 and the associated public health restrictions, the Government is funding a rates waiver for the first half of 2021.  Funding of &euro;320m has been announced. </p>  <p>  As has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage regularly and constructively with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and other matters arising.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the local authorities expenditure plans, it is a matter for each authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual revenue budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p></reply>

As such, the Flemish Decree effectively restricted significantly more than development rights in respect of new housing.  The broad scope of the Flemish Decree was such that it was successfully challenged in the European Court of Justice, which ruled that it was contrary to EU freedoms. </p>  <p>  Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005  (which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000), planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  </p>  <p>  Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) has been in force as the overall national planning policy document, as part of Project Ireland 2040.  In this regard, National Policy Objective (NPO) 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.  </p>  <p>  The NPF is a planning policy framework and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  Work is currently underway in my Department on an update of the 2005 Guidelines and in doing so, having regard to the principles of the outcome of the &lsquo;Flemish decree&rsquo; case, where relevant.  I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I would expect updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising them that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department.</p></reply>

The Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will focus on the establishment of the corporate form and financial structure of the Agency. The Bill recently concluded Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is in place, arrangements will be finalised for the capitalisation of the LDA with funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion being provided from Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). The overall capitalisation of &euro;1.25 billion for the LDA from ISIF, along with its borrowing ceiling of &euro;1.25 billion, are prescribed in the LDA Bill which the LDA was consulted on during the Bill drafting phase. This capital will be utilised by the LDA to support the delivery of its projects on an economic basis in line with the provisions of the Bill. </p>  <p>  The capitalisation of &euro;1.25 billion was decided by Government on 7th September 2018 prior to the launch of the LDA. The New Economy and Recovery Authority (&ldquo;NewERA&rdquo;)(a business unit of the National Treasury Management Agency) advised the Department of Housing and the Department of Finance on the appropriate borrowing limit for the LDA, which was set at &euro;1.25 billion.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that all of the LDA's funding requirements to date have been provided for by my Department.

The number of individuals presenting to homeless services and the number of people accessing emergency accommodation continued to decline in the first quarter of 2021, following a trend first established in fourth quarter of 2019.  The March report confirms that there were 8,060 individuals accessing emergency accommodation, a decrease of 1,847 individuals, or 18.6%, on the 9,907 total recorded one year previously.  This is the lowest number of homeless individuals recorded since June 2017.  These Reports confirmed a decrease in the number of single individuals accessing emergency accommodation in March.</p>  <p>  These reports also show that at the end of March, a total of 539 individuals were being housed under the Housing First programme. I look forward to the targets outlined in the National Implementation Plan for the programme being achieved by the end of this year.  I wrote to each local authority on 26 February to recognise the progress made on Housing First to date, to stress the importance of the national targets being met, and to confirm that the expansion of the programme from 2022 for the years ahead will be announced later this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to reducing and preventing homelessness and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this work as a priority.  Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and includes specific measures to address these needs. These include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring that there is dedicated funding and resources to deliver the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs. </p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a priority for me and for this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.</p></reply>

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave.</p><p>As matters stand, it is under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001, relating to absences from the role, that councillors may be absent for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months.  Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council. </p><p>A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment, currently worth &euro;17,706 per annum. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. </p><p>With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors.  Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit.</p><p>Following the publication of Ms Sara Moorhead S.C.&rsquo;s <i>Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members</i>, I approved the establishment of a working group of key local government stakeholders, including councillor representative organisations.  The working group was tasked with drawing up an Action Plan for examination and implementation of the non-pay related recommendations in the Moorhead Report. Included in its terms of reference is consideration of the issue of maternity and parental leave options.  Addressing these non-pay issues, together with the pay reforms proposed, will facilitate the retention of existing councillors, while also maximising the accessibility of local government to future candidates.  The working group first convened in February and has met four times to date. It will shortly finalise its Action Plan. </p><p>However, as I believe that the issue of maternity leave warrants urgent attention and includes wider matters and supports other than maternity leave, I asked the local government stakeholder working group to establish a subgroup specifically to examine all maternity-related matters for councillors.  This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, has met twice to date. The considered discussions within the group have helped my officials and I to more fully understand the maternity-related needs of women councillors. This ongoing engagement will inform policy approaches in relation to supports available to councillors taking maternity leave, but also to identify the complex legal issues involved in and possible legislative options necessary to provide for maternity leave for councillors.  </p><p>I recognise that this issue is a percevied obstacle to the participation of women in local government. I am however determined to address the matter in a progressive manner, including through legislative change, if necessary, to ensure that local authority elected members are fully representative of the constituents they serve but also that the role of the councillor is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p><p>All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  <i>The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF)</i>for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services. The Framework was developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.</p><p>Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework. This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the NQSF arrangements.  The Standards and Facilities Teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users. The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation. The DRHE has confirmed to my Department that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and addressed in a timely manner.</p><p>Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p><p>My Department has been advised that Dublin City Council and the DRHE have commissioned a comprehensive review of all properties/facilities being managed by both NGOs and by private operators.  They have confirmed that this report, when complete, is to be published. They have advised my Department that they have also initiated a procurement process for the engagement of an external body or company to take on the permanent role of inspecting and reporting back on all properties being funded by the DRHE, with such reports to be published on the DRHE website.</p></reply>

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p>  <p>  In relation to Limerick City and County Council, the local authority has received over &euro;6.5 million of funding from 2014 to 2020, supporting the return of 393 properties to use.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work remediating vacant social housing properties in 2021.

This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.</p></reply>

The fisrt of these entails the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities.  To support this, under the Serviced Sites Fund, &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of &euro;198 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes.</p><p>  All Serviced Sites Fund proposals are assessed on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities, which are required to verify local affordability challenges, project viability, and the ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.</p><p>Whilst an application for Serviced Sites funding has not been made by Laois or Offaly County Councils to date, it is open to Councils to do so should they identify an affordable housing challenge and the viability to deliver homes against the above-mentioned criteria.</p><p>Separately, a new National Affordable Purchases Shared Equity scheme is currently being designed for private developments.  My intention is that this measure will be available nationally.  It will help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake purchased by the State, between the maximum mortgage available to eligible households and the price of the new home they wish to buy.  The objective of the scheme will be to increase housing supply by activating viable planning permissions and to enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford.  </p><p>In relation to Cost Rental, a range of work is ongoing to deliver this new form of housing. My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver projects in a variety of ways, in order to prove the concept of this new sector. This is in conjunction with the policy development for the sector that is set out in the forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p><p>Cost Rental will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities.  It will be focused, at least initially, in densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. It is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges.</p><p>One of the main sources of State funding for Cost Rental homes is the new Cost Rental Equity Loan scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in funding in Budget 2021. It gives AHBs access to Government loans on favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the cost of new Cost Rental homes. Following the detailed assessment of submitted proposals, approval was granted for the funding this year of 390 new Cost Rental homes, located in Dublin, Kildare, and Cork. Cost-covering rents for these homes will be at least 25% below comparable open market prices. Further details of these homes, including precise locations, will be published when the successful AHBs have completed necessary commercial arrangements. I intend seeking an expansion to this scheme through the review of the National Development Plan and the Budgetary process, in order to give AHBs certainty of funding on a multi-annual basis and allow them to plan developments into the longer term.</p><p>The detailed provisions to operationalise each of the schemes referred to above will be contained within a new housing Bill which I intended to bring to the Oireachtas in the very near future to allow their commencement this year.</p><p>Both the Help to Buy and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan remain available to eligible purchasers to make the cost of housing more affordable.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  Under the Valuation Acts 2001 - 2020 a property is rateable unless it is expressly exempted.  Schedule 4 lists the categories of property which are exempt from rates. There are no provisions or definitions in the Valuation Acts that specifically cover or address the term &ldquo;bed and breakfast&rdquo;. However, the Acts do contain several provisions relating to such properties which must be read as a whole. Regard must also be had to determinations of the Valuation Tribunal and the Courts in interpreting the legislation.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the question as to whether a particular property offering accommodation is or is not rateable, or the extent to which it may be rateable, is a matter of law to be established by reference to the facts of each case. </p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2020, including a decision as to whether a property is or is not rateable. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.  Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

For example:</p><p><b>The Voids Programme</b>funds local authorities to remediate vacant homes to ensure they meet minimum letting standards. Since 2014, 16,102 vacant local authority homes have been remediated and re-let at a cost of &euro;229m</p><p><b>The Energy Efficiency Programme</b>aims to upgrade homes. Since 2014, 60,357 homes have benefited from retrofitting works at a cost of &euro;134m. Budget 2021 saw a significant uplift in Energy Efficiency funding and the Programme for Government commits to further funding being made available to local authorities going forward for planned maintenance works; insulation, windows and doors and heating systems</p><p><b>The Disabled Persons Grant Scheme</b>funds necessary adaptations to local authority housing stock to accommodate the needs of the elderly and disabled and to relieve overcrowding. Since 2014, thousands of households have had their living conditions improved at a cost of &euro;94m.</p><p><b>The Regeneration Scheme</b>funds programmes of estate regeneration in a number of targeted areas around the country. These projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration. Projects being funded under the Programme target the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, including those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour. Over &euro;300m of exchequer funding has been provided to support this programme.</p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in these area in 2021, however, it is important to note that my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach for housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys of circa 140,000 social homes in local authority ownership over a 4 to 5 year timespan. This is scheduled to commence in late 2021 as part of the piloting of the ICT system to support this work. The subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes will be determined as a result of these surveys. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under various stock improvement programmes support this approach.</p></reply>

The authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled. This is in line with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive which sets out requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water with the objective of protecting the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges.</p>  <p>  The EPA is the key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges. </p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s recent report on the performance of urban waste water treatment in 2019 shows that, while many challenges remain, Irish Water is continuing to make progress and is improving our waste water systems.  Irish Water has reduced the number of priority waste water sites listed by the EPA and has increased the number of large towns and cities that now meet the required EU standards for waste water discharges.</p>  <p>  In addition to its major investment programme, Irish Water has brought forward proposals for a Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme, as part of its Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024 submitted to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. The Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. My Department understands from Irish Water that an allocation of &euro;97.5m for this programme was approved by the CRU. Irish Water is also prepared to support local authorities who wish to seek funding for un-sewered villages through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund of the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  In terms of overall national policy, the River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 outlines what Ireland is doing to protect and improve our waters.  This is supported, amongst other measures, by a new water quality resource in the Local Authority Waters Programme; by the Irish Water&rsquo;s Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024; and by new capital investment for rural water services.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Programme for Government commits to a new revised and strengthened River Basin Management Plan in 2022, to protect Ireland&rsquo;s water quality and ensure that we have a well-protected environment and vibrant communities. </p>  <p>   The investment needs across our entire water system are considerable and will take a number of investment cycles to fully resolve and will require significant and sustained investment.  Under the Programme for Government, the Government has committed to continuing the &euro;8.5 billion funding package agreed in Project Ireland 2040, which will be invested in public water services to ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of Ireland&rsquo;s water and waste water infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and ensure compliance with EU Directives.</p></reply>

Public Services, private companies and volunteers rallied together and worked non-stop to halt the spread of the flames, both physically on-site and in an administrative capacity. </p>  <p>  Preliminary mapping by NPWS staff has shown that that in excess of 2500 hectares, half the terrestrial area of the park, of priority habitat has been extensively damaged by this fire, as well as having severe localised impact on flora and fauna. The cause of the fire is still under investigation and the NPWS will be following up with authorities including the Kerry Fire Services to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the blaze.  One of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.</p>  <p>  With regard to the question of firebreaks, as stated above, my Department is assessing the impacts of the fire and will be assessing the best means for wildfire control, over such a large area,  in consultation with experts.</p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland through a variety of Committees and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property.</p>  <p>  The EU position is that the challenges raised by the proponents of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) waiver can be addressed through the existing flexibilities within the WTO TRIPS Agreement which allows governments to grant compulsory licences without the permission of the patent holder. The EU Commission also points out that the IP system incentivises and enables the stakeholders to share their innovations, to exchange knowledge and data, and to license.  </p>  <p>  The EU position is that manufacturing capacity, access to raw materials and distribution networks are the main obstacles that need to be overcome in the supply of vaccines and that increasing manufacturing capacity may be better attained through voluntary licensing arrangements by disseminating the technology and know-how of those who developed the vaccines.  The EU Commission has set up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and address supply chain bottlenecks.</p>  <p>  The EU is committed and open to trying to reach agreement with all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on how to achieve the shared goal of providing timely and secure access to safe and affordable vaccines and medicines for all through the multilateral rules-based trading system.  Discussions are continuing at the WTO, including in relation to how the TRIPS Agreement can support fast and effective vaccine availability. Ireland is represented in those discussions by the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID-19 vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p></reply>

This webpage brings together all State guidance on remote work into one place and includes an employer checklist outlining all the relevant considerations to be undertaken for remote working in the longer term - and can be accessed online at </p><p>In January of this year my Department published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Remote Work Strategy. The Strategy will ensure that remote working is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. The report is built on three pillars:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment</p><p>2. Develop and Leverage Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework</p><p>Under these pillars there are 15 actions to be delivered in 2021 to progress remote working into the future. </p><p>The Government, via the National Remote Working Strategy, has committed to legislate to provide employees the right to request remote working. On 1st April, the T&aacute;naiste  launched a public consultation on this plan and I would encourage employers and employees alike to make their views known. The closing date for submissions is Friday 7th May.</p><p>On 29th April, my colleague Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, launched a new &euro;5m Connected Hubs Fund to support the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first national network of remote working hubs. The Fund will expand existing hub facilities, providing additional hot desks, office spaces and meeting rooms for remote working. The Connected Hubs Fund will support the key objectives of Our Rural Future &ndash; the Government&rsquo;s ambitious new five year policy for rural Ireland.

Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers and that care is often expressed in the form of understanding, compromise and flexibility. </p>  <p>  COVID-19 vaccinations are an extremely important public health measure in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in the community and in workplaces. There is no provision under occupational safety and health legislation to obligate employers to give employees time-off to avail of COVID-19 vaccinations. However, employers should bear in mind that in offering employees time off to facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations they are, in fact, ensuring that the greatest level of workplace safety against COVID-19 can be maintained in their business.  Facilitating workers to avail of COVID-19 vaccination appointments will greatly assist in the recovery of individual businesses and of the wider economy.</p>  <p>  I would encourage employees to engage with their employer in the first instance once they are assigned a vaccination appointment to explore all options available to enable them to receive the vaccination should it fall during working time. I would also encourage all employers to be as flexible and supportive as possible with a view to maintaining good employment relationships over the long term.</p>  <p>  Employers are obliged to take reasonable steps to provide a safe place of work for their staff. In circumstances where employers fail to consider any of the reasonable options, an employee may have recourse to pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 or the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015.</p></reply>

Analysis carried out for similar schemes has shown that where annual turnover is less than &euro;50,000, then it is likely that most costs will be payroll based and the Government is providing subsidies or other income supports in the form of the EWSS and the PUP. </p>  <p>  Small businesses are crucial to our economy and the Government continues to keep all schemes under review.</p></reply>

These guidelines are available on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has worked closely with key industry groups to develop these detailed operational guidelines. The guidelines are designed to support business owners and management in the wider tourism sector as they tackle the challenges specific to their industry and offer detailed advice on the systems that should be put in place to help instill public confidence, and reboot businesses, while adhering to public health advice and Government protocols.</p>  <p>  These guidelines are regularly updated in line with Public Health advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the National Public Health Emergency Team, including on the application of social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the tourism and/or hospitality sectors.</p>  <p>  I also understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is providing funding to Local Authorities for outdoor infrastructure and, also, through Local Authorities to the tourism and hospitality sectors for suitable equipment. The Local Authority Weatherproofing and Outdoor Dining Infrastructure Scheme is a Capital Grants scheme developed in collaboration with Local Authorities which will allow for the upgrade and enhancement of streets and public spaces including weather-proofing solutions which will facilitate outdoor dining.</p></reply>

As enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as Minister of State in the Department, I can confirm that the CCPC has informed me in relation to these questions that the CCPC itself does not test products to determine their content or effectiveness. Where concerns are raised in relation to traders&rsquo; activities, including any advertisements that may represent a misleading commercial practice, as defined under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the CCPC has its own procedures to screen and assess the issue concerned. The CCPC has informed me that this encompasses an assessment of the activity against the relevant statutory provisions of Consumer Protection legislation and, where they identify potential breaches, take the appropriate action. This may also include inspections of traders&rsquo; activities to ensure they are providing consumers with accurate information in relation to the products on sale and that they are complying with relevant consumer protection legislation. Where breaches are found the CCPC has a range of sanctions available to it, ranging from direct engagements with the trader to more formal civil and criminal enforcement actions. </p>  <p>  When an enforcement action is taken, the CCPC is required to keep and maintain a list of names and addresses of the relevant companies and individuals. The CCPC places the names and addresses of the relevant companies and individuals together with the description of the trade, business or profession and any particulars the CCPC may consider appropriate in respect of the enforcement actions, on this list. This list is the Consumer Protection List (CPL), which the CCPC publishes each year. A review of the CPL&rsquo;s for the period 2016-2020 shows that there were 187 enforcement actions taken against a range of traders across various sectors. One of the types of enforcement action taken is a Compliance Notice, which can direct a trader to take remedial action to bring it in line with relevant consumer protection legislation. A &ldquo;direction&rdquo; to companies, as outlined in the PQ, is taken to mean a direction through a Compliance Notice, as set out in Section 75 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. The CCPC have confirmed with me that in the 2018 CPL there were two Compliance Notices issued that included directions to traders to &ldquo;provide true and accurate information with respect to their status as a trader in all communications, including advertisements&rdquo;. These related to traders operating in the motor trade sector. </p>  <p>  The CCPC informed me that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the CCPC&rsquo;s ability to conduct in-store inspections at trader&rsquo;s premises. As a result of this development and also to reflect the move by consumers to more online purchases in 2020, the CCPC moved the focus of their compliance inspection online in the second half of last year. Over 50 websites were inspected in 2020 to assess traders&rsquo; compliance with a range of legislation and any necessary follow up enforcement actions in relation to those inspections are ongoing.  </p>  <p>  In addition to enforcement actions, the CCPC may engage with traders where they identify potential breaches of consumer protection legislation in order to bring about compliance. Where this is not achieved on a voluntary basis, the CCPC may follow up with more formal compliance action. The CCPC is also very proactive in relation to informing businesses about their obligations in relation to consumer protection legislation, including their obligations regarding advertising. Some specific initiatives in this regard can be found on the CCPC website such as:</p>  <p>  - Guidance on advertising for business and their obligations in relation to consumer protection legislation.</p>  <p>  - Guidelines for business on selling online, which also includes guidance for social media channels as traders that use social media channels to sell goods or services, may be considered a business and it is important that they check what their obligations are.</p>  <p>  - Guidance for traders on the Textile Labelling Regulations.</p>  <p>  - Guidance on product prices as traders must display the selling price of every item offered for sale, and make it clear what particular item the price relates to. </p>  <p>  In addition, the CCPC has informed me that they proactively engage with business in relation to their obligations in this area. Some recent examples include the CCPC participation in February this year in the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI) webinar on influencer marketing in which the CCPC availed of the opportunity to inform online influencers of their legal obligations when advertising and promoting products online. The CCPC has also recently worked with the Local Enterprise Office to provide a series of training sessions to SME Retail Groups in relation to their consumer protection obligations, including advertising.</p></reply>

However, while EU Member States currently report emissions and removals from the land use sector, there are no specific targets for emissions and removals from land use. This will change with the application of a new EU land-use accounting<b><i></i></b>system, under the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation (LULUCF).Under the new system, emissions and removals will be assessed over two consecutive accounting periods, the first from 2021 to 2025, and the second from 2026 to 2030. Accounting takes place twice covering the 5-year periods: for the first time in 2027 when 2021 to 2025 inventory data is reported, and for the second time in 2032 when 2026 to 2030 inventory data is reported.</p><p>The impact of emissions and removals from five out of six land use sectors will be included in the new system from 2021 (Managed Cropland, Managed Grassland, Afforestation, Deforestation, and Managed Forests), with Member States having the option to include the impact of the sixth, Managed Wetlands, in this first period. Ireland has opted to include the impact of Managed Wetlands on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the beginning of 2021. This voluntary accounting puts Ireland on a stronger footing for accounting for greenhouse gas emissions and removals and in making the strategic changes required to support the country to meet our national, European and international climate change targets. </p><p>It is important to note that due to the uncertainty related to emissions from Managed Wetlands it is not currently possible to provide definitive estimations for such contributions. Factors which will support a net removal of emissions from Managed Wetland for the period 2021 to 2025 include:</p><p>- a reduction in peat extraction activity, for example through the recent cessation of peat harvesting by Bord Na M&oacute;na; and</p><p>- the restoration and rehabilitation activities planned under the Bord na M&oacute;na Enhanced Decommissioning, Rehabilitation and Restoration Scheme.</p><p>It should be noted that there are also activities that could potentially cancel out some of the expected net removals (e.g. an expansion of horticultural peat extraction above that in the reference period 2005 to 2009 or fires on wetlands).</p></reply>

This commitment is referred to as the "no debit rule". For example, if a Member State converts forests to other land uses (deforestation), it must compensate for the resulting emissions by planting new forest (afforestation) or by improving the sustainable management of existing forest, croplands, grasslands or wetlands.  Under the LULUCF Regulation, Ireland can avail of 26.8Mt CO2eq credits associated with land use over the period 2021 to 2030. Thus for 2030, under EU legislation, Ireland will be able to use removals associated with land-based activities in meeting its 2030 emission reduction targets.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan identified the following measures for Ireland to achieve this 26.8Mt CO2eq of abatement:</p>  <p>  - an average of 8,000 ha per annum of newly planted forest, and sustainable forest management of existing forests (21 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement);</p>  <p>  - at least 40,000 ha per annum of reduced management intensity of grasslands on drained organic soils (4.4 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement);</p>  <p>  - better management of grasslands, tillage land and non-agricultural wetlands (1.4 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement).</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  The requirement for a small number of homes to be incorporated in all CEG applications was included in the context of these ambitious home retrofit targets.  Homes are a core element of every community so it is entirely reasonable that they be included in applications for grant support under this scheme.  </p>  <p>  This requirement is not intended to exclude any applicant.  The scheme requires just one home to be included in applications for it to be deemed in line with the relevant criteria.  I am informed that the company referred to in the Question has made a successful application under the scheme this year within the existing requirements.  It is noteworthy that demand for the scheme under the existing guidelines has been very strong - applications with a value in excess of &euro;30 million have been received by SEAI under the most recent call for projects.  This indicates that the requirement for homes to be included in projects has not impacted negatively on uptake.  No decision has been taken in relation changes to the scheme requirements for future calls for projects.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that a range of other supports and schemes for businesses are also funded by my Department and operated by SEAI.  These include:</p>  <p>  - The Excellence in Energy Efficiency Design (EXEED) grant scheme supporting businesses to undertake design, construction and commissioning projects using the EXEED certification process.</p>  <p>  - The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat &ndash; financially supporting businesses in adopting renewable energy for heat including heat pumps and heating systems using biomass or biogas.</p>  <p>  - Project Assistance Grants helping fund feasibility studies and business cases for energy performance improvements.</p>  <p>  - Training (SEAI Energy Academy), information and advisory service, access to energy auditing services and case studies of best practice.</p>  <p>  - Large Industry Energy Network where members work together to improve energy performance and share experiences. </p>  <p>  There is also the Accelerated Capital Allowances process operated by Revenue which allows businesses to reduce their taxable profits by the full level of expenditure on energy efficient equipment in the year the investment is made.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. </p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter for discussion between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted, without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has considered the matter raised and our investigations show that the premises referred to in the Question should be able to access high speed broadband from their service provider. My Department has raised a query regarding the premises in question with the network operator to obtain the current status for the premises. As soon as a reply is received my Department will revert to the Deputy with an update.</p></reply>

The Agency reported a figure of  580,977 tonnes of hazardous waste generated   in 2019, which was up 54,580 tonnes on the 2018 figure.  65% of Ireland&rsquo;s hazardous waste was exported for treatment in other European countries in 2019,  compared with 73% in 2018.  The Agency also noted that incinerator bottom ash from the Dublin Waste to Energy facility was re-classified as non-hazardous waste in 2020, following testing in the Netherlands. This will contribute to reduced figures In this category in 2020.</p>  <p>  The EPA is currently revising the National  Hazardous Waste Management Plan for the 2021 to 2027 period. This revision will incorporate related proposals in the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy and examine where additional national capacity is feasible.</p>  <p>  Reducing the rates of hazardous waste treated will require reducing the  sources of such waste. Therefore, changes being introduced via the review of the Industrial Emissions Directive and the  new EU Chemical Strategy, which will lead to less hazardous waste produced, are particularly important.  The Agency also supports innovative projects aimed at reducing hazardous materials placed on the market via the Green Enterprise programme.</p></reply>

While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses, I must emphasise, that this decision has been taken in line with official public health recommendations that everyone in Ireland work to limit the spread of the virus by staying at home in so far as is possible and minimising social contacts. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the RSA is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services resume. In this regard, the aim is to double capacity at test centres over a three-month period. </p>  <p>  Normal capacity before the pandemic was approximately 15,000 tests per month.  When the service reopened in June 2020, this was increased to 25,000 to deal with the backlog which had developed by that point.  Based on the capacity of 25,000 tests per month, the aim is to provide an additional 25,000 tests per month on top of this for the first 3 months of reopening, or a total of 75,000 extra test appointments over the three-month period. This would make substantial inroads into numbers waiting over that time period.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, the RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. The online service has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses and is now being evaluated with a view to extending the online service to all test types during 2021.  However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.</p></reply>

This Act sets out the roles and responsibilities of a number of bodies.</p>  <p>  Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport has the &ldquo;general superintendence&rdquo; of matters relating to wrecked or stranded vessels. However, further provisions outline the responsibilities from an operational perspective for other bodies. </p>  <p>  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel. However, if the appropriate authority, in this case Cork County Council, considers the wreck is or is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment, it shall proceed to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless.</p>  <p>  Separate provisions apply regarding ownership, sale and proceeds for wrecks and a Receiver of Wrecks appointed under the Act deals with these matters.</p>  <p>  As the appropriate authority under the Act, Cork County Council has taken the lead in dealing with the case in question and has taken a number of steps to date in their duties under the Act. </p>  <p>  My Department has been represented by the Coast Guard at a number of inter-agency meetings on the matter. Furthermore, on foot of a recommendation in a report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) on the grounding of the wreck concerned, my Department has established a working group to explore the risks and potential costs to the State presented by derelict ships entering Irish territorial waters and coming ashore in Ireland and make proposals for means to identify, monitor, track and interdict derelict ships before they endanger other ships and seafarers in the vicinity.  </p>  <p>  While the Act does allow for the removal of a wreck, it does not contain provisions in relation to the costs associated with the removal of a wreck where the sale of that wreck is not possible, and the owners of the vessel cannot be located. It is understood that no evidence of ownership or insurance has come to light yet in the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My Department is available to attend operational inter-agency meetings on this issue. Furthermore, in light of the recent fire at the site of the wreck concerned, I have asked my officials to engage directly with Cork County Council as the appropriate authority with a view to assessing appropriate next steps.</p></reply>

Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. </p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically  for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. </p>  <p>  This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. It cannot be excluded that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season.</p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis. On 5  March 2021, I chaired a special meeting of the Steering Committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum. A sub-group of the NCADF, specifically tasked with developing an Aviation Restart Plan at the meeting on 5 March, submitted a report dated 14 April with proposals that they believe will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. My department has written to the NCADF seeking additional information and clarity on the operational readiness of the sector regarding a resumption of international travel, including detail on how passengers will travel through our airports in a safe and COVID-19 compliant manner. I will review this report and its proposals, and will also engage with other ministers and Government as required.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, an aviation sub-group has also been charged with looking at the needs of the aviation sector in Ireland in the context of the impact of COVID-19. This sub-group, which I chair, is attended by delegations from labour and employer representative bodies.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we are committed to progressing the work that will allow the sector to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.</p></reply>

In this regard, the aim is to double capacity at test centres over a three-month period. </p>  <p>  Normal capacity before the pandemic was approximately 15,000 tests per month.  When the service reopened in June 2020, this was increased to 25,000 to deal with the backlog which had developed by that point.  Based on the capacity of 25,000 tests per month, the aim is to provide an additional 25,000 tests per month on top of this for the first 3 months of reopening, or a total of 75,000 extra test appointments over the three-month period. This would make substantial inroads into numbers waiting over that time period.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, the RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. The online service has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses and is now being evaluated with a view to extending the online service to all test types during 2021 However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.</p></reply>

Though a protracted recovery is likely, the progress of our national vaccination programme and those of our European and other international partners will be key to recovery. My Department is monitoring the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis, in consultation with all key stakeholders and relevant government departments. Though we are not yet positioned to restart aviation, we are preparing the ground for when we can. Until then, Government will continue to provide support to the aviation sector. It is estimated that over An estimated &euro;200 million in operational supports for Irish airlines and airports, have already been made available under the range of schemes provided by Goverment. </p>  <p>  Getting international travel back up and running is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and remains a priority for the Government. However, this can only be accomplished at a time that is safe to do so, and with public health advice fully considered.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the recent restart and recovery report produced by the aviation industry participants of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum (NCADF). The report contains many recommendations for consideration across Government and requires engagement across all relevant Government Departments and consultation with public health authorities, which is now underway.  As part of the ongoing process, I have written to the NCADF seeking additional information and clarity on the operational readiness of the sector regarding a resumption of international travel, including detail on how passengers will travel through our airports in a safe and COVID-19 compliant manner.</p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p>  <p>  The extension of Covid19 level 5 restrictions by Government means that the Driver Theory Test continues to be suspended.  While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses, I must emphasise, that this decision has been taken in line with official public health recommendations that everyone in Ireland work to limit the spread of the virus by staying at home in so far as is possible and minimising social contacts. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the RSA is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services resume. In this regard, the aim is to double capacity at test centres over a three-month period. </p>  <p>  Normal capacity before the pandemic was approximately 15,000 tests per month.  When the service reopened in June 2020, this was increased to 25,000 to deal with the backlog which had developed by that point.  Based on the capacity of 25,000 tests per month, the aim is to provide an additional 25,000 tests per month on top of this for the first 3 months of reopening, or a total of 75,000 extra test appointments over the three-month period. This would make substantial inroads into numbers waiting over that time period.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, the RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. The online service has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses and is now being evaluated with a view to extending the online service to all test types during 2021.  However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.</p></reply>

The recommendations broadly ranged from measures to improve the safety of air travel, to rebuilding regional and international connectivity, and to making financial support measures available to the sector. The current course of COVID-19 means that international travel is reduced to only essential journeys, and in that context the aviation sector is operating at very low levels of activity.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce report was very much focused on how to aid recovery, and while now is not the time to stimulate and encourage recovery, the building blocks for recovery are being put in place for when the public health situation can support the gradual return of non-essential international air travel.</p>  <p>  A number of financial supports have been made available to the aviation industry, including meeting the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations for the extension of the wage subsidy scheme and the provision of liquidity supports. The wage subsidy scheme has been extended into 2021, as has the waiver of commercial rates. Liquidity support for medium and large enterprises has been made available to all sectors, including the aviation sector, through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. Both of these programmes have been created in line with EU State Aid rules. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. The aid will take the form of direct grants. </p>  <p>  The scale of the challenges created by COVID-19 are better understood now than when the Taskforce reported.  While the recommendations of the Taskforce do remain relevant, those relating to recovery and growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, in line with the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions. </p>  <p>  My Department will forward an updated report to the Deputy, in tabular format, on the status of implementation of each of the recommendations.</p></reply>

The details are set out in Finance Act 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.</p>  <p>  The scheme applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.</p>  <p>  The Bill defines Covid restrictions as those &ldquo;restrictions provided for in regulations made under sections 5 and 31A of the Health Act 1947, being restrictions for the purpose of preventing, or reducing the risk of, the transmission of Covid-19 and which restrict certain business activity during the specified period&rdquo;. These regulations make provisions in relation to specific locations e.g. county or region or can operate nationally as is the case currently. Therefore, it is appropriate that the scheme would provide assistance to businesses which operate in the restricted location and this is decided by the physical location of their premises.</p>  <p>  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an events company or a circus, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  </p>  <p>  The vast majority of businesses in Ireland are affected by Covid but the CRSS is intended to target specific businesses where access is restricted. The CRSS is and was intended to be a targeted scheme, and was never meant to be a general support measure for the entire economy as the cost of such a scheme would be much more significant.</p>  <p>  The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

It is fair to say that that taxpayers' interests would not have been best served by such an extension in circumstances where it is likely that we will all be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. It may be more appropriate to take stock again after a further period and assess then if the position needs to be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  While in operation, the purpose of the Stay and Spend scheme was to provide indirect support to service providers. This included, amongst others, hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, caravan and camping parks and self-catering properties registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As regards the question raised by the Deputies, site fees payable by owners of mobile homes would not have fallen within the ambit of qualifying expenditure. </p>  <p>  With regard to the possibility of other tax reliefs on fees payable by owners of mobile homes to service providers, I do not believe it would be equitable to introduce such a relief. </p>  <p>  More generally also, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, changes to measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></reply>

In general, whether an individual can make a claim in relation to life insurance cover will depend on the specifics of the policy, including in the scenario referenced in the question. The Deputy will also appreciate that I cannot adjudicate on the validity of any claims, or on the particulars of what an insurer covers, as these are contractually based. In addition, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).   </p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the service of an insurance provider, it is advisable that that person make a complaint through the firm's internal complaint resolution process. The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, including life insurance. This can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

The scheme was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. </p><p>Under the scheme, employers were expected to make best efforts to maintain their employees&rsquo; net income by &lsquo;topping up&rsquo; the subsidy payment where possible. However, there was no legal requirement to do so as many businesses were closed and had no financial capacity to make the payments. Any &lsquo;top up&rsquo; payments made to employees by employers were taxed in the normal &lsquo;real time&rsquo; manner while the TWSS payments were not taxed until year end. These TWSS related tax liabilities are correctly owed by the employee rather than the employer.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the person in question has an outstanding tax liability of &euro;1,220.44 for 2020.

Nor do I have a role in approving any deal that may be agreed between the two parties.</p>  <p>  Although the State has a 14% minority shareholding in Bank of Ireland, commercial transactions of this nature are the sole responsibility of the Board and management of the bank. The independence of the bank in this regard is protected by the Relationship Framework in place which is a legally binding document that cannot be changed unilaterally. This framework, was insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, whilst the management of staff affairs, including staffing levels, is entirely a matter for KBC and Bank of Ireland were they to acquire the business, I would expect both banks to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff and to fully comply with all statutory requirements. In addition, I would expect engagement with staff representative bodies as appropriate. </p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the current Irish law in the area of the &ldquo;transfer of undertakings&rdquo; is the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 &ndash; S.I. No. 131 of 2003 (TUPE Regulations).  The Regulations implement the EU Transfer of Undertakings Directive (EU Directive 2001/23/EC) which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger.  Also, section 21 of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 transposed a further provision of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive in relation to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer. </p>  <p>  The main provisions of the TUPE Regulations provide that all the rights and obligations of an employer under a contract of employment (including terms inserted by collective agreements), other than pension rights, are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.  The new employer must also continue to observe the terms and conditions of any collective agreements until they expire or are replaced.  An employee may not be dismissed by reason of the transfer alone.  However, dismissals may take place for economic, technical or organisational reasons involving changes in the workforce.  Both the outgoing and incoming employers are obliged to inform their respective employees&rsquo; representatives of, inter alia, the reasons for the transfer and the legal, social and economic implications of the transfer.  Where there are no representatives, the employers must arrange for the employees to choose representatives for this purpose. </p>  <p>  Where an employee considers that a breach of the Regulations has occurred, a complaint may be made to an Adjudication Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and appeals therefrom to the Labour Court.</p></reply>

It was legislated for in Section 28 of the Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and was an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.  The very latest data from Revenue indicate that over 66,600 employers were supported through the TWSS in respect of more than 664,500 employees at a cost of &euro;2.8bn.  The Scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. </p>  <p>  It will be recalled that in order to maximise the financial support provided to recipients, tax on TWSS payments was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system and that instead the liability for the 2020 tax year was determined at the end of the year by Revenue through the regular &lsquo;end year review&rsquo; process. </p>  <p>  Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of their income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid, or overpaid for the year.</p>  <p>  Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p>  <p>  When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it is facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the TWSS. Details of these arrangements are available on the Revenue website at</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/twss/employers/index.aspx.</p>  <p>  Should an employer wish to pay these liabilities on behalf of their employees, on an exceptional, once-off basis and subject to certain conditions, Revenue will not apply the Benefit-in-Kind (BIK) rules that would usually apply where employers make payments of this nature on behalf of their employees. </p>  <p>  Revenue has informed me that the facility for employers to pay their employees&rsquo; income tax and USC liabilities arising from the TWSS is available whether their employees are taxed through the PAYE system or are self-assessed taxpayers. The issue of extending the BIK concession to proprietary directors is under active consideration by Revenue and it expects to publish additional guidance on the matter shortly.</p></reply>

In the last two months, we have seen several major announcements including the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and the potential withdrawal of KBC Bank Ireland, the forthcoming closure of a large number of bank branches by Bank of Ireland and a much smaller number by AIB.  </p>  <p>  The sector is facing a number of long running challenges such as negative interest rates, technological change that is reducing the barriers to entry to a whole range of new entrants, changing customer preferences as they use more and more digital services, while still wanting the traditional branch network to be available.  Competing with online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector. </p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. Notwithstanding the recent announcements in the banking sector, Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions.  In addition, An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  Bank of Ireland has announced that it is following suit.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to ensure that the banking and financial system is one which will effectively contribute and support economic growth and employment. Competition in the sector is vital to ensure that businesses and consumers have a range of options available when using financial services and accessing credit.</p>  <p>  As such, my Department is considering a review process that will look at the many issues in depth, provide sensible analysis and implementable recommendations and I hope to be in a position to set out greater details on this in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exempt from VAT.  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland, by way of special derogation from the general rule, has retained the application of VAT at the reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to repair or maintenance services relating to movable goods. </p>  <p>  However, certain items supplied in the course of any such repair/maintenance service, are specifically excluded from the reduced rate and are therefore liable at the standard rate, currently 23%. These items include accessories, attachments or batteries and tyres, tyre cases, interchangeable tyre treads, inner tubes, and tyre flaps for wheels of all kinds.</p>  <p>   The supply of maintenance or repair services of mechanical goods, other than vehicles and agricultural machinery is subject to the two-thirds rule. This rule requires that to benefit from the reduced VAT rate the cost of the materials supplied during the course of the service must not exceed two thirds of the total amount payable for the supply of the service.</p></reply>

As such, my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy.</p><p>Nonetheless, in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my officials contacted the Central Bank for the information requested. The Central Bank advised that where a non-life undertaking has been authorised in another European Economic Area country, no further authorisation is needed for the undertaking to write non-life business in the State under the Freedom of Establishment or Freedom to provide Services provisions (passporting).</p><p>With this in mind, there were 29 applications for authorisation as non-life insurance undertakings made to the Central Bank in the period from 01 January 2016 to 31 December 2020: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of Applications </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>16 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Of the 29 applications, 21 were authorised - eight applications were withdrawn or not subsequently pursued by the applicant. In terms of origin, 19 of the total were in respect of Irish undertakings and 10 were from UK firms seeking authorisation of a third country branch in the State.</p><p>The UK withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered an 11-month implementation period until 31 December 2020. During this time, EU law continued to apply in the UK, but not thereafter. This meant that UK insurers, who previously provided insurance products and services to Irish customers from 31 December 2020 could no longer avail of the European passport. In order to be in a position to continue to provide these products and services, some UK insurers established firms or third country branches in the State and sought authorisation as non-life insurance undertakings. Accordingly, this led to an increase in applications for authorisation especially in 2018, in advance of the original withdrawal date of 31 March 2019.</p></reply>

An Appropriate Assessment Screening process for the work was completed, in line with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, and a contractor was appointed to undertake the works.</p><p>The emergency works were carried out by the appointed contractor under the supervision of the OPW and their consultants (incl. a fisheries specialist) on the night of Tuesday April 27<sup>th</sup>last.  The works as completed were judged to have had the planned effect of creating a pool from which the fish could pass with greater ease and the work site was cleared by the early morning of Wednesday April 28<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>The estimated cost of these emergency works is &euro;70,000 (excluding VAT.).</p><p>An investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass has commenced and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue over the coming months.</p></reply>

No. 77/1995), as amended.</p>  <p>  This Regulation also provided that, where a person, who had previously served in the civil or public service and paid modified insurance, had a break in service they would become Class A Social Insurance contributors. </p>  <p>  Secondly, where a person is fully insured under the Social Welfare regulations their occupational pension is generally integrated with the State Pension i.e. in calculating the pension payable to an individual account is taken of any social welfare benefits to which an individual has an entitlement.  This is sometimes referred to as co-ordination with the State Pension.  The aim of integration with the social insurance system is to prevent &ldquo;double pensioning&rdquo; where both an occupational public service pension and the State Pension Contributory would both be payable</p>  <p>  Supplementary pensions is one particular aspect of integrated pensions which arise when a bridging payment is required to provide for an individual's overall public service pension entitlement because there can be a shortfall in this benefit in certain circumstances e.g. when a person due to causes outside his/her control, fails to qualify for social insurance benefit or qualifies for such benefit at less than the maximum personal rate.  However, these payments are not automatic and subject to rules.</p>  <p>  These integration arrangements and the rules for the payment of a supplementary pension have always existed for fully insured Civil and Public servants. For example, the relevant provision for one of the main health sector schemes is rule 9.5 in SI 362 of 2010 for the HSE superannuation scheme. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Health has overall responsibility for Health Sector public service pension schemes and is best placed to answer further detailed questions on the operation of scheme rules as there are different health sector pension schemes which can apply for psychiatric nurses depending on particular the employer involved.</p></reply>

These reports are intended to provide additional detail in relation to spending by these Departments, identifying key areas where spending is either above or below profile and setting out the outlook for the year taking into account the impact of Covid-19 on programmes and projects. The reporting in relation to capital spending reflects the key role that capital spending can play in enhancing the resilience of the economy and in providing key social infrastructure. This reporting is in the context of the level of capital carryover into 2021 and the 19% increase in core capital spending set out in Expenditure Report 2021. </p>  <p>  These quarterly reports provide further detail and context to Government in relation to spending and progress on programmes and projects, and are an important element of the overall expenditure management framework. </p></reply>

Under EU rules, public contracts above certain values must be advertised EU-wide and awarded in competitive tendering in an open and transparent process.  National rules provide for similar processes.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime delivering transparency and best value for money outcomes.  The aforementioned rules have been developed in tandem with the WTO rules on procurement and are therefore flexible in a global context.  </p><p>The general requirements for public works and works-related government contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan.  The CWMF incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by Circulars and Guidance issued by this Department and the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), which reflects the NI Protocol, contains specific provisions ensuring access to the public procurement markets of both parties.  The principal aspects, for above the EU threshold procurements, include <i>inter alia</i>:</p><p>- Continued access to public procurement opportunities in both jurisdictions to interested providers and; </p><p>- Non-discrimination obligations to ensure that interested providers in each jurisdiction are treated no less favourably than nationally-based providers.</p><p>Additionally, the TCA provides for reciprocal treatment and access to procurement opportunities for companies established in each other&rsquo;s jurisdiction for below-threshold procurements.</p><p>The Common Travel Area (CTA) also provides additional rights to UK and Irish citizens to live and work in both jurisdictions. The combined effect of the TCA, the NI Protocol and the CTA means that procurement opportunities in both jurisdictions remain open to businesses on both sides of the border.</p></reply>

The lengthy closure of retail and hospitality outlets, culture, arts and entertainment venues, along with requirements to work from home for many office based staff, has led to a significant falloff in economic and social activity in what were, prior to COVID, vibrant and dynamic business and community spaces. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery. Together with horizontal measures introduced by Government, such as the EWSS and the CRSS, the sector-specific measures I have introduced to date, including the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme and the Covid Adaptation Scheme are key in helping tourism businesses to survive and adapt.  The Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme and the Urban Animation Scheme being run by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in partnership with Local Authorities, are particularly important to town centres. </p>  <p>  As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, the Government will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  As the economy reopens on a phased basis over the coming months, city and town centres, which rely on the cumulative attractiveness of retail, hospitality, attractions and the experience economy, face a complex set of challenges that need to be addressed if they are going to maximise the benefit of reopening and take advantage of the recovery. The pandemic has required new approaches to the urban trading environment, including greater use of outdoor spaces to trade. The expansion of outdoor dining and social spaces in cities and towns will require a coordinated approach.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are involved in on-going discussions with a number of Government Departments and the Business, Enterprise and Innovation Committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) regarding the challenges faced, and steps being taken, by city and urban areas in the period ahead arising from the COVID pandemic.  I also continue to engage with the sector on a regular basis and in particular through the Hospitality and Tourism Forum.  </p>  <p>  In line with our Programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This new policy will set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector, not just in our cities and towns, but also in regional and rural areas. Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.</p><p>  In terms of specific supports for the local print sector, it is of particular importance regarding media organisations to avoid any perception of undue Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am, however, cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.</p><p>This is a sector which is undergoing fundamental changes due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising. In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion. While the Commission is not a representative body, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to be in a position to appoint a member of the Commission who has a strong background in local print and radio. In addition, at the Commission&rsquo;s invitation, the representative group, Local Ireland, has participated in two panel discussions with Commission members and the public as part of the Commission&rsquo;s series of thematic dialogues. The Commission has therefore been extensively briefed on issues facing the local print sector. I look forward to receiving the Commission's report in the summer. The print sector has participated in the Commission&rsquo;s consultations and will be part of the recommendations.</p><p>  The sector has suffered losses from Covid-19 and is receiving Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme. In the shorter term, the loss of advertising the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has been helped by the public health advertising placed by the Government. I understand that in the region of &euro;4.4 million has been expended on regional print advertising from March 2020 to date.</p><p>My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to continue to explore issues and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present. </p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Under the <i>Creative Communities</i>initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community.  Kerry County Council also established a Culture and Creativity Team led by a Creative Ireland Coordinator to oversee implementation of their Strategy.  The cross-functional Culture and Creativity Teams (including Arts Officers, Heritage &amp;amp; Biodiversity Officers, Librarians, Archivists, Conservation Officers, Irish Language Officers, Local Enterprise Offices) is a unique model, providing local authorities with an agile and adaptable resource to address locally-relevant priorities.</p><p>Through <i>Creative Communities</i>, funding provided to Kerry County Council for the period 2018-2020 is set out in the table below and it has supported an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in Co Kerry. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th colspan="2">2018</th>       <th colspan="2">2019</th>       <th colspan="2">2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Funding </td>       <td>Events </td>       <td>Funding </td>       <td>Events </td>       <td>Funding </td>       <td>Events </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>&euro;145,885.00 </td>       <td>40 </td>       <td>&euro;138,774.00 </td>       <td>52 </td>       <td>&euro;182,201.00 </td>       <td>34 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2021, I have allocated &euro;145,160 to Kerry County Council under <i>Creative Communities</i>to support their programming and delivery of creative initiatives as part of their implementation of their Culture and Creativity Strategy.  </p><p>Within the local authority network, the public libraries have to date proven to be a significant partner in supporting the implementation of <i>Creative Communities</i>initiatives.  For example, I note that within the Kerry Culture and Creativity Strategy there is a priority, amongst other things, to</p><p>- implement a Kerry Library Events Programme to develop outputs including author visits, displays, workshops, promotions, Irish language and culture, the Right to Read literacy programme, and story-time events, and</p><p>- explore The Sceala&iacute;ocht Chiarra&iacute;/ Stories of Kerry project. </p><p>Significant resources are being made available to Kerry County Council in this regard including support for its Creative Ireland Kerry Creative Communities grant scheme through which community groups and organisations may apply for funding.  Therefore, and in recognition of their leading role in the funding and delivery of creative programming as part of their implementation of their Culture and Creativity Strategy, I would urge <i>Storied Kerry</i>to liaise directly with the Creative Ireland Coordinator at Kerry County Council.

It comprised representatives of the FAI, GAA, and IRFU as well as stadium operations and event managers, officials from my Department and Sport Ireland. The Group reviewed international guidance, considered lessons from spectator events hosted elsewhere in Europe, and consulted independent health and safety experts. The Working Group prepared draft guidelines which will guide preparations for test events and beyond. </p>  <p>  I am cautiously optimistic that once test events can be undertaken and lessons drawn from those that we can slowly grow spectator attendances.

Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the survival and recovery of the tourism sector, of which hospitality is a key component. </p>  <p>  A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed last year to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which includes a set of recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 to me in September last year and it has been an important input for myself and my colleagues in Government in considering measures to assist the tourism sector. </p>  <p>  Together with horizontal measures implemented to support businesses across the economy, such as the EWSS and the CRSS, the sector-specific supports I have introduced have been key in helping tourism businesses to survive and employees to remain engaged in the sector. The VAT rate for the sector has been reduced to 9%, which will improve competitiveness and viability of businesses. Any future change to our commitment on the VAT rate or future taxation policy is a budgetary matter but I will continue to engage with the Minister for Finance on these issues in view of the evolving situation in tourism.</p>  <p>  The Recovery Oversight Group I appointed last December is keeping me informed of progress on the implementation of the Recovery Plan and developments in the tourism sector more generally and will continue to inform my thinking with regard to ongoing supports.</p>  <p>  As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will be outlining how it will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  We will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  In line with our Programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This new policy will set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.</p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the reliance of visitor attractions on international visitors and the repercussions of restrictions on international travel for the sector.  As set out in the Tourism Recovery Plan, survival, stabilisation and recovery are the requirements for tourism and I will continue to work with industry stakeholders on the measures required.</p>  <p>  In today's market, offering a wide variety of tourist accommodation helps ensure that various consumer preferences can be catered for and also enhances supply in areas or at periods of high demand.  The self-catering sector plays a significant role in this regard, adding to the tourism accommodation stock in popular rural areas, and offering visitors autonomy and flexibility.</p>  <p>  Horizontal support schemes such as the EWSS, PUP and the Rates Waiver have been worth hundreds of millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors.  In line with the recommendations of the Recovery Oversight Group, the Government extended the economy-wide supports for businesses and employees until the end of June and has committed that there will not be a cliff edge end to the supports currently in place.</p>  <p>  I am aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as the National Tourism Development Authority tasked with supporting the sustainable long-term growth of Ireland's tourism industry, engages regularly with the Irish Self-Catering Federation on a range of activities and supports for the sector.</p>  <p>  I am referring the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further direct reply to the Deputy including details of its engagements with the Irish Self Catering Federation and continued support for the self-catering sector.

A number of key values underpin <i>Culture 2025 </i>including the right of everyone to participate in the cultural and creative life of the nation.  The Arts Council Strategy (2016&ndash;2025) <i>Making Great Art Work</i>includes having more people enjoying high-quality arts experiences as a stated objective.  The Arts Council also has specific supports for artists with disabilities.</p><p>In terms of National Cultural Institutions (NCIs), the circumstances and opportunities in each institution can vary considerably but the commitment and interest towards enhanced inclusion and accommodation is very strong in all cases.  The management team in each institution have constant regard to both access and inclusion policies.  The recognition and provision of disability facilities is a particular feature of the current very significant &euro;460m programme of investment in the cultural institutions and all new facilities will conform to the highest standards.  The NCIs also welcome contact from individuals, families and organisations in relation to the needs and interests of people with difficulties and disabilities.  The development and implementation of disability policies and services in each institution are responsibilities of their management and Board.</p><p>While my Department's primary focus in the past 15 months has been on the development and delivery of a range of new and emergency supports for the arts, culture and entertainment sectors, we continue to meet regularly with NCIs on a broad agenda including plans for their ongoing reopening in line with public health advice.</p></reply>

Over 400 applications had been received by the closing date of 14 April.  Assessment of applications to the scheme is underway. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;14m is being made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. This scheme has been developed following wide consultation with the sector.  Administrative arrangements for this scheme are being finalised and it is hoped that it will open for applications in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. </p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p></reply>

This year, the sixteenth edition of Culture Night will take place on Friday 17th September 2021.  Culture Night has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event in Dublin in 2006, to the significant national cultural event it is now, with some 400,000 people visiting museums, galleries, historic houses, artists&rsquo; studios and cultural centres across the island in 2019. Culture Night became a national event from 2008 onward. In 2020, responsibility for steering and funding Culture Night on a national level was transferred from my Department to the Arts Council.</p><p>Thanks to the support of the Arts Council and local authorities, all activities are made available to the public free of charge.  Details of the 2021 Culture Night programme are available on the Culture Night website .</p><p>Primary support for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council which is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching &euro;130 million in 2021. A wide range of arts organisations are supported by the Arts Council by way of grants under a range of categories including Bursary, Strategic Funding, Project Awards and Touring and Dissemination awards.Under the Arts Act, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.</p><p>Supports from the Arts Council are in addition to the wide range of non-sector specific horizontal supports available for businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19.  The Government's response to the impact of the pandemic on the economy is comprised of a broad range of supports delivered across a range of Departments. Along with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, there are a number of enterprise supports including the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19.  Information in relation to the business and financial supports provided by the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Employment place for businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be viewed at the following link: .</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead</i>plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  The plan committed to the development of sectoral guidance for very large purpose built event facilities, for example: stadia, auditoriums, conference or event centres. I established the  Return to Live Entertainment Working Group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and develop COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  The Group includes stakeholders from across the live entertainment sector as well and those with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events.  The Group will produce a set of overarching guiding principles that all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes. It is chaired by my Department and had its first meeting on 21 April 2021. The  Return to Live Entertainment Working Group includes stakeholders with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events and is will produce a set of overarching guiding principles which all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes. </p><p>The Arts Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland entered into a strategic partnership in order to develop guidance for the safe presentation of festivals and live events. This document is currently at the consultation stage and is due to be published in the coming weeks.  While the timeframe for the resumption of entertainment events is dependent on public health considerations, it is critical that a set of COVID-19 guidelines is developed and ready in advance of the re-opening of the sector.</p><p>I recently announced the allocation of a &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support the Live Entertainment Sector this year. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports. </p><p>The new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments of:-</p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p><p>Supports provided to sectors that are impacted by COVID-19 are kept under review.</p></reply>

The Recovery Oversight Group will keep me apprised of progress with regard to implementation of the Recovery Plan and the recovery of the sector more generally.</p><p>The Oversight Group presented its first report to me in February, setting out progress to date and areas it has identified as requiring attention. The report welcomes the progress made to date and highlighted a number of areas on which the Oversight Group recommends the Government should focus its attention. I brought this report to the attention of my colleagues in Government to ensure they are fully up to date with the position in tourism as we prepare the National Economic Recovery Plan. </p><p>A number of the areas highlighted by the Group have already been addressed in the COVID plan, <i>The Path Ahead</i>. The CRSS, EWSS and Local Authority Rates waiver have all been extended out to the end of June 2021. As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I am delighted that we have been able to begin the process of reopening the sector, one of the worst hit by the pandemic, in the latest easing of restrictions. From 10 May, we will be able to once again enjoy a broad range of cultural and tourism experiences around the country. As we move further into the summer, we will see this welcomed reopening expanding into other areas of the tourism and hospitality sector, with hotels and other accommodation open from 2 June. Across Government, we will also continue to work at national and EU level on the safe return of inbound international tourism, which remains critical for the sector. In the context of the report submitted by the Oversight Group, I also welcome the substantial progress made under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. </p><p>These are just the first steps in our plan for reopening. If we continue to work together, doing the right things, in the right way, we will be in a position to reopen many more services and venues into the future. Updates from the Recovery Oversight Group, along with the original Recovery Plan produced by the Tourism Recovery Taskforce, will continue to inform my options in terms of helping tourism to recover in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p></reply>

Amongst other things the unit will enhance public awareness of the issues involved in wildlife crime, develop closer working liaison arrangements with other agencies and bodies involved in enforcement and will provide a channel for collating and disseminating of intelligence in relation to wildlife crimes.

The draft NMPF is Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive marine spatial plan document and outlines the clear structure and direction proposed for the development, conservation and enjoyment of our maritime area. This important new text will, when established, stand as the marine equivalent of the terrestrial National Planning Framework and will become the key decision-making tool for regulatory authorities and policy makers into the future.</p><p>The National Marine Planning Framework is the culmination of very extensive public and stakeholder engagement during its development over the past 4 years. It is our belief that the Plan needed to be strategic as well as instructional, and informed by effective public and stakeholder participation.  Therefore, a core principle in developing the Plan has been to ensure that, as well as the wider public, all relevant marine stakeholders were consulted with, and encouraged to contribute at each available opportunity.</p><p>My Department convened a significant number of regional workshops as part of the consultation, with each regional workshop focusing on marine themes appropriate or significant to their respective locations. Following the launch of the NMPF baseline report in 2018, 5 regional public events were held as part of the statutory public consultation. When we launched the draft NMPF, a further 8 public consultation events, 7 of those held in coastal locations throughout the country, occurred during 2019 and 2020. Officials from my Department consulted with members of a variety of fishing organisations at these events. </p><p>In addition to these public events, my Department engaged and participated in over 150 conferences, seminars and marine stakeholder events during this time, promoting awareness and understanding of both the NMPF and the public&rsquo;s role in the wider marine planning process.</p><p>The Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) Advisory Group, which I chair, was established in 2018 to guide the development of the NMPF. This Group was invaluable in imparting collective knowledge and expertise, while also offering guidance on strategic thinking and decision-making in the preparation of marine spatial plans.  The Group featured representatives of the environmental, economic, and social pillars, including the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF). The MSP group met 11 times on the following dates:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><div><b>Date</b></div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20 March 2018</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13 June 2018</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19 September 2018</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>14 February 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>09 April 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 June 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16 July 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 November 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>26 May 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>22 September 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23 February 2021</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As part of the wider public engagement process on the NMPF, and in keeping with my Department&rsquo;s role in the promotion of  awareness and understanding of both the NMPF and the public&rsquo;s role in the wider marine planning process,  officials from my Department also held stakeholder meetings with the Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums on the following dates:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>26/04/2018</th>       <th>Stakeholder meeting with Southeast RIFF</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01/05/2018</td>       <td>Stakeholder meeting with North RIFF</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>02/05/2018</td>       <td>Stakeholder meeting with West RIFF</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>09/05/2018</td>       <td>Stakeholder meeting with Southwest RIFF</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01/06/2018</td>       <td>Stakeholder meeting with Northeast RIFF</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Throughout the NMPF development period, and up to and including last week, my Department has regularly engaged in correspondences with a variety of fishing organisations and their representatives, endeavouring to respond to those queries with the necessary urgency and clarity required. My Department&rsquo;s continued engagement with the fisheries community and representative bodies will not cease with the publication of the NMPF, and I believe this is an important message to deliver to those communities.  </p><p>I am acutely aware of several ongoing issues affecting the Fisheries community, among the most urgent being the issue of diverse levels and standards of communications between the fisheries and ORE industries.  To directly address these concerns, and also with the wider aim of promoting constructive engagement and consultation between the fisheries community and the ORE industry, I have instructed my Department officials to commence the formation of a Seafood/ORE working group, with the initial aim of agreeing a communications protocol between these two strategically important Marine sectors. </p><p>While the initial focus of the working group will be on the aforementioned communications protocol, it is the intention of my Department that the proposed Seafood/ORE group will, in time, address other issues affecting the Fisheries community, such as dislocation, co-existence, the impact of developments (including exploration of development sites) and Safety at Sea.</p><p>My Department will, in the coming weeks, formally invite nominated representatives of NIFA and NIFO to participate in the proposed working group, and I look forward to their constructive input.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are quite detailed and technical in nature.  My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) have analysed the submissions received, in conjunction with the contracted SEA and noise consultants, and are in the process of preparing finalised guidelines having undertaken detailed consideration and analysis of the submissions received.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising the technical guidance on the noise aspect in conjunction with DECC (which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters). However, this piece of work is quite technical in nature and a small number of matters remain to be resolved in this regard.</p><p>Once the outstanding issues have been finalised by both Departments, the proposed amendments will need to be reviewed by the SEA consultants in order to conclude the SEA process.</p><p>My Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible. However, the work on the outstanding technical issues has pushed the finalisation of the Guidelines into Q2 2021.</p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not have a role in relation to the development of the Wind Energy Developement Guidelines. Its primary function in the planning system is to make determinations on planning appeals, relevant planning applications and other prescribed matters. The provision of the policy and legislative framework under which the planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la perform their statutory planning functions  is a matter for me as Minister. </p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-05a.726.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050500071#WRN03875"><p>The Planning and Development and Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest, resulting in great difficulty for households finding affordable accommodation. In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% per annum. The annual rent increase restriction applies to both new and existing tenancies, irrespective of a change of landlord.</p><p>Not all properties in RPZs are subject to the 4% restriction. </p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;</p><p>or</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning. A protected structure is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 Act provides a legal definition of &lsquo;substantial change in the nature of rental accommodation&rsquo; to illustrate the type of works to be carried out to a rental property to qualify for an exemption from the annual rent increase restriction applicable in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).</p><p>Such works shall result in:</p><p>- a permanent extension increasing the floor area by 25%; or</p><p>- an improvement in the Building Energy Rating (BER) by at least 7 ratings; or </p><p>- at least 3 of the following:</p><p>-- a permanent alteration of the internal layout;  </p><p>-- adaptations for a person with a disability;  </p><p>-- a permanent increase in the number of rooms;  </p><p>-- an improvement in the BER by 3 or more ratings where the original BER was D1 or lower; or</p><p>-- an improvement in the BER by 2 or more ratings where the original BER was C3 or higher.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 do not stipulate a maximum or minimum rent amount to be charged in an area and places no obligation on a landlord to charge a rent. Section 19 of the Acts prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds the prevailing market rent. There is no legal obstacle to landlords reducing rents in an RPZ or elsewhere in the country.</p><p>During the pandemic, landlords are being urged to show forbearance to tenants with regard to the levels of rent payable and any arrangements that might be made should rent arrears arise. It is open to the parties to agree informal temporary rental arrangements during the pandemic and this does not contravene RPZ legislation. Such arrangements are viewed as a pragmatic response to the temporary impacts of Covid-19, lowering rents for tenants when most needed.</p><p>In order better enforce RPZ legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with enhanced powers and resources to carry out investigations and to sanction landlords if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs. The maximum sanction is &euro;30,000.  Alternatively, a tenant may wish to refer a dispute for resolution to the RTB and a lawful rent can be enforced and damages of up to &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</p><p>My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keeps the operation of the rental market under review. It is important to have rent transparency and a rental system with fair rent and certainty for tenants.  I intend to bring forward comprehensive rental legislation in the Autumn with provisions to address long term security of tenure, rent levels and the impact of online platforms taking units out of the rental market.  The matter raised will be examined in the context of that legislation.</p></reply>

This report focuses on the comparative analysis of delivery streams particularly related to cost effectiveness, including leasing. This report can be found at the following link:</p><p>This Report found that the net present cost (NPC) of delivery through leasing varies nationwide and can, in specific areas, be above or below the NPC of delivery through construction or acquisition.  There are a number of factors to consider, along with cost, when considering whether leasing is good value in the long term for the State, such as the overall mix of delivery, the speed of delivery, the quality and appropriateness of the accommodation, sectoral capacity and flexibility, the availability of capital and the availability of land.</p><p>While the Government&rsquo;s objective is to focus strongly on local authority led build activity, long-term leasing is an important option available to local authorities to supplement delivery and secure high quality social housing on a long-term basis. Lease payments are paid to the property owner based on a discounted market rent, with the level of discount reflecting the variation in maintenance and management responsibilities taken on by the owner. The maximum lease term is 25 years and rents are reviewed every 3 years linked to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). </p><p>The standard long-term leasing programme has been in operation for over 10 years and has a well-established assessment protocol. Local authorities have delegated sanction to lease up to four dwellings. All proposals to lease five or more dwellings must be submitted to my Department for approval. These proposals must be accompanied by an independent valuation of the market rent for the properties, carried out by, or commissioned and paid for by, the relevant local authority. The Enhanced Leasing Scheme was launched in 2018 and all potential proposals are submitted by the proposers to the Housing Agency for initial assessment and co-ordination with local authorities. The proposal is then submitted to my Department for approval. As with long-term leasing, all enhanced leasing proposals submitted to my Department must be accommpanied by an independent valuation of the market rent for the properties, carried out by, or commissioned and paid for by, the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

The issue of sale and of purchase of land or housing are matters for the Minister for Justice.  I am working with my Government colleagues to bring forward comprehensive proposals to address this issue as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  I would note that institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the housing market which based on the last census in 2016 was more than 2 million houses and apartments.  Industry estimates suggest that the total number of residential units under institutional ownership in Ireland was approximately 15,550 at the end of 2020, less than 1% of the total housing stock.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy. </p>  <p>  The presence of such institutional investors in the market helps to increase the supply of housing, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. This is essential to reaching the National Planning Framework targets and to support more sustainable living generally. However, the possibility of a trend of investment emerging where already or nearly completed traditional family home estates are purchased in bulk is deeply concerning and not in line with Government policy.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 4 May last, I received Government approval for the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which I will shortly be bringing before the Oireachtas.  A key aspect of this Bill is the reform of Part V of the Planning and Development Act by increasing the existing 10% obligation for social housing in residential developments to a 20% obligation for social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise the increase in the supply of homes and supports which enable first time buyers access their own home.</p></reply>

In recent years, it has been subject to extensive research by the Discovery Programme, funded by my Department, through which our knowledge and understanding of the site has been greatly increased.</p>  <p>  Against a general background of increasing visitor numbers, my Department has been developing a conservation management plan for the state-owned lands at the Hill and is leading a working group of relevant stakeholders, including the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for day to day management, Meath County Council, the Heritage Council and the Discovery Programme, with the objective of progressing, completing and publishing the updated plan as soon as practicable. </p>  <p>  As a result of this process, the Department is now in the final stages of producing the plan. The preparation of the plan has included a monument condition survey to inform the conservation needs of the monuments on the State-owned lands. An online visitor survey, as well as a visitor profile, was also undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology at the request of the Discovery Programme and Heritage Council. In addition, a Strategic Environmental Assessment Screening Report and a Report for Screening for Appropriate Assessment have been produced. My Department is now reviewing all relevant documentation with a view to bringing the plan to completion by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  The new plan will focus on conservation issues and will inform a list of priority conservation and site management actions and measures to be implemented over its lifetime. It will inform future interventions on the site, aided by the ongoing monitoring of visitor numbers by the OPW. It will concentrate on the lands that are in the ownership of the State and as such, it will not, nor is it intended to, address land use and planning issues in the wider environs of Tara. Parking and traffic management, as well as other visitor facilities outside the area of the State-owned lands, are matters for the local authority, although the Plan may provide useful guidance to the authority in that regard. My Department is also available to advise and assist the local authority with any related proposals in the context of its role in protecting the archaeology and amenity of the Hill of Tara itself.</p></reply>

This Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society and this is reflected in the Programme for Government &quot;Our Shared Future&quot;. </p><p>The Programme for Government makes commitments to intoduce affordable purchse and cost rental programmes.  The commitments in the programme are a direct response to well-accepted issues with housing affordability in both the home purchase and private rental markets, particularly in major urban areas.</p><p>I am currently progressing two affordable purchase schemes. The first of these entails the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities.  To support this, under the Serviced Sites Fund, &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of &euro;198 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes.</p><p>All Serviced Sites Fund proposals are assessed on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities, which are required to verify local affordability challenges, project viability, and the ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.  </p><p>Separately, a new National Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme is currently being designed for private developments.  My intention is that this measure will be available nationally.  It will help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake purchased by the State, between the maximum mortgage available to eligible households and the price of the new home they wish to buy.  The objective of the scheme will be to increase housing supply by activating viable planning permissions and to enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford sooner than would otherwise be the case.  </p><p>In relation to Cost Rental, a range of work is ongoing to deliver this new form of housing. My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency, and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver projects in a variety of ways, in order to prove the concept of this new sector. This is in conjunction with the policy development for the sector that is set out in the forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p><p>Cost Rental will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities. It will be focused, at least initially, in densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. It is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges.</p><p>One of the main sources of State funding for Cost Rental homes is the new Cost Rental Equity Loan scheme. It gives AHBs access to Government loans on favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the cost of new Cost Rental homes. </p><p>The detailed provisions to operationalise these schemes in 2021 will be contained within a new housing Bill which I intended to bring to the Oireachtas in the very near future to allow their commencement this year.</p><p>In the meantime both the Help to Buy and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan remain available to eligible purchasers to make the cost of housing more affordable.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year. </p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 484/2015) and the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. Guidance for Local Authorities on the administration of the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 was issued in November 2015.</p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.  </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p></reply>

The local authority or AHB is responsible for day-to-day property maintenance. These dwellings are allocated dwellings and the social housing tenant signs a tenancy agreement with the local authority or AHB, who acts as the landlord to tenants. Responsibility for the structural maintenance of the dwelling remains with the owner of the dwelling.</p>  <p>  A discount of 20% is applied to market rent for the property to take account of the tenant management and property maintenance responsibilities taken on by the local authority or AHB. Where a management company is in place and an annual service charge is payable, a discount of 15% is applied. In these circumstances, the owner of the property is responsible for payment of the annual service charge. The day-to-day maintenance of the properties is funded from the differential rent payable to the local authority in respect of the property. Properties entering the leasing scheme must meet all relevant statutory requirements and local authorities may set out additional requirements for properties entering into their leasing programme. </p>  <p>  Under enhanced long term leasing arrangements, the owner of the property is required to provide day-to-day maintenance of the properties under a schedule of management services. A discount of 5% is applied to the market rent to take account of the tenant management responsibilities taken on by the local authority. Penalties are applied and deducted from the rent where services are not performed as required.  Any service charges payable are paid by the owner of the property. </p>  <p>  Maintaining the landlord tenant relationship between the local authority or AHB and the social housing tenant under the long term leasing schemes is key feature of the scheme for both local authorities and social housing tenants. This feature means that a discounted market rent is paid in respect of these dwellings.  </p>  <p>  I have no role in regulating the advertisement of financial products online.</p></reply>

The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.  HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections as all private rented tenancies.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. The Government&rsquo;s objective, in terms of supply, is to focus strongly on new build, and in particular, local authority led new build activity. However, leasing is one of a range of options available to local authorities to supplement delivery. </p>  <p>  Under long term leasing arrangements, suitable properties can be leased to a local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) for periods of between 10 and 25 years. The local authority or AHB is responsible for day-to-day property maintenance. Varying discounts - between 5% to 20% - are applied to market rent  to calculate the lease payment for the property to take account of the level of tenant management or property maintenance responsibilities taken on by the local authority or AHB. Unlike HAP, leased dwellings are sourced by the local authority or AHB and are allocated dwellings.  </p>  <p>  Leased properties can be sourced through a range of different schemes - including direct leasing by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme, the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) and the Enhanced Leasing Scheme - and have the potential to provide faster and more flexible delivery than traditional delivery methods. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP and Leasing schemes under review as they are key mechanisms in meeting housing need across the country.</p></reply>

The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted. </p>  <p>  At end 2020, 37.9% of the total number of households being supported by HAP in Louth were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 17% above rent limits provided. </p>  <p>  My Department keeps HAP rent limits under constant review, as well as the use of discretion by local authorities. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I continue to keep the matter under review.</p>  <p>  All households in receipt of HAP pay a differential rent based on the rent scheme set by the relevant local authority. The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is set out in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that; the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; and that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship. </p>  <p>  Local discretion and flexibility are inherent in the devolved function of administering rent schemes.  Decisions regarding the increase or decrease in the rent charged to tenants of local authorities are matters for individual local authorities in accordance with its differential rent scheme.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed as part of a coherent framework of housing and health care supports for people with disabilities and compliments the Government&rsquo;s mental health policies as set out in the strategy documents - A Vision for Change and the Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings Time to Move On (2011).  </p>  <p>  Housing accommodation for persons with a disability can be provided by the local authorities and approved housing bodies with funding from central government through two mainstream capital programmes; the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. </p>  <p>  Persons with disabilities are entitled to apply for a housing support assessment in the same manner as other citizens. If they have specific needs and these are specified as a basis of application, and supported by medical evidence, they will be taken into account in allocating a dwelling as local authorities strive to provide housing that is tailored to the needs of the individual to enable them to manage their disability in a more effective manner. In the case of private rented accommodation a person with a disability may source their own accommodation and be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment.  </p>  <p>  Persons with a disability make up approximately 8% of those on local authority housing waiting lists. Since 2016, allocations of homes to persons with a disability has ranged from 10-12% of all allocations. The existing strategy is under review and public consultation and research has begun.

Staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) are presently conducting work to assess the initial impacts of the fire. Staff are currently mapping the entire boundary of the fire and using satellite data to assess the area burnt. Conservation Rangers are undertaking internal mapping of the area burnt; conducting preliminary assessments of the impacts and severity of the fire on various habitats and vegetation types. NPWS Officials are also preparing specifications for a comprehensive, in-depth assessment of the long-term effects of the fire, and where restoration efforts can be concentrated.</p>  <p>  We will also work to enhance the activity programme at the Park this year and we are advancing a significant number of capital projects too - all designed to enhance the visitor experience.

In addition to the considerable resources already made available as part of Budget 2021, I recently announced that  the ranger recruitment process presently underway would be accelerated to facilitate the engagement of 60  additional Conservation Rangers around the country, to add to the resources available to deal with a range of functions, including wildlife crime. Many of these new recruits will be deployed to the southern region and to Killarney National Park. I've also asked that the NPWS locally to augment their local fire patrols by deploying the Killarney Meitheal group to carry out patrols  too. This is a hugely valued volunteer corps and, like the huge response of Kerry people, wasn't found wanting either the weekend before last.</p></reply>

The first of these entails the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities.  To support this, under the Serviced Sites Fund, &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of &euro;198 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes.</p><p>  All Serviced Sites Fund proposals are assessed on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities, which are required to verify local affordability challenges, project viability, and the ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.</p><p>Whilst an application for Serviced Sites funding has not been made by either Cavan or Monaghan County Councils to date, it is open to both local authorities to do so should they identify an affordable housing challenge and the viability to deliver homes against the above-mentioned criteria.</p><p>Separately, a new National Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme is currently being designed for private developments.  My intention is that this measure will be available nationally.  It will help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake purchased by the State, between the maximum mortgage available to eligible households and the price of the new home they wish to buy.The objective of the scheme will be to increase housing supply by activating viable planning permissions and to enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford. </p><p>In the meantime both the Help to Buy and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan remain available to eligible purchasers to make the cost of housing more affordable.</p></reply>

This would be to enable the plan preparation process to extend beyond the two year cut-off period specified in planning legislation.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that Minister O'Brien and I have requested officials to draft legislative proposals that would give effect to the option of an additional period of up to six months, should that be required, for the completion of any city or development plan process that has either commenced or is underway during level 5 Covid restrictions.  This would mean that any stage of ongoing development planning processes could benefit from additional time ranging from 1 day to six months, as required.

We have also used the opportunities provided by Security Council thematic discussions on conflict and hunger, and on conflict-related sexual violence, to highlight these aspects of the Tigray crisis.</p>  <p>  An immediate ceasefire is the most important step all parties can take. In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding some improvement in humanitarian access, the humanitarian situation continues to be concerning, in particular the situation of internally displaced persons. There are allegations of the use of starvation as a weapon of war.  I am concerned by attacks on humanitarian workers.  </p>  <p>  There are multiple, credible and harrowing reports of ongoing human rights violations, including sexual violence, in Tigray. These must cease immediately and perpetrators be held to account. The use of rape as a weapon of war is unconscionable.  I strongly support the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, working with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, to investigate reported atrocities. It is vital that these investigations be credible and transparent, and address the issue of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to advocate for an effective response to the situation in Tigray, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict through bilateral engagement, our EU membership and also at the UN Security Council, where we remain actively engaged with other Council Members on further ways to address the crisis.  Supporting this advocacy, Minister Coveney continues to engage on an ongoing basis with a range of key interlocutors on the situation, including with counterparts in the Horn of Africa region, the Gulf, as well as the African Union.</p>  <p>  Ireland is working with partners to ensure a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis, as underlined by Minister Coveney during the discussion on Ethiopia at the April meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC).  Minister Coveney maintains close contact with his Finnish counterpart, Foreign Minister, Pekka Haavisto, who has recently visited the Horn of Africa region on two occasions on behalf of the EU. </p>  <p>  At the April FAC, Minister Haavisto debriefed EU Ministers on his recent visit to Ethiopia, providing a very worrying assessment of the conflict and its humanitarian consequences.  Ministers discussed next steps for the EU, and there was agreement on the urgent need for a ceasefire, and investigations into allegations of human rights abuses, war crimes and sexual violence.</p>  <p>  On 11 March, the EU published Council Conclusions on Ethiopia, which reiterated the EU&rsquo;s deep concern for the situation in Tigray. The EU also recently allocated an additional &euro;53 million in humanitarian aid for Ethiopia, including for those affected by conflict in Tigray.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has to date provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the vital humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through our trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground. Since the outbreak of conflict, we have had to pause some of our planned longer term development engagement in Tigray (for example in relation to agriculture), and adapt other interventions to ensure a conflict-sensitive approach and a strong focus on humanitarian response, human rights and sexual violence.</p></reply>

The report includes statistical information on programme expenditure in a series of annexes which clearly show the distribution of aid, including the amounts given to developing countries, and the amounts allocated to our priority focus areas as set out in <i>A Better World</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy. The Annual Report serves as a core accountability and transparency tool, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure under the aid programme, and demonstrating the results that have been achieved.  A breakdown of the top 30 countries in receipt of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA for the years 2017-2019 has been included in the table below. Annual Reports for 2019 and previous years are available on the Irish Aid website.</p><p>With regard to figures for 2020, validation of data on Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme is done in arrears, and prior to publication, draft statistical returns are shared with the relevant OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) experts for assurance that Ireland's reported spending meets the DAC's criteria to be counted as ODA.

Many pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children may attend special schools or classes.</p><p>I wish to advise that, in line with the Act,  my Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils and young persons with special educational needs, including children who are Deaf or hard of hearing, to ensure that children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. </p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, work in partnership with parents to advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development.  The NCSE also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language.  The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>As regards the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (the NCCA) is currently reviewing and redeveloping the Primary Curriculum Framework NCCA have had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this work in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum.&rsquo;  Inclusive education and diversity is one of the eight principles of teaching and learning proposed.  One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able to understand, interpret and use different forms of communication including gesture, expression, spoken language (English, Irish and other languages), printed text, broadcast media, and digital media.  Phase one of the consultation on the draft Framework is complete.  Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will opportunity for the NCCA to have continued engagement with children and teachers who use ISL in schools and to learn from their experiences.  It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.</p><p>At post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: <i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests. </p></reply>

Many pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children may attend special schools or classes.</p><p>I wish to advise that, in line with the Act, my Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils and young persons with special educational needs, including children who are Deaf or hard of hearing, to ensure that children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. </p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, work in partnership with parents to advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development.  The NCSE also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language.  The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>As regards the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (the NCCA) is currently reviewing and redeveloping the Primary Curriculum Framework NCCA have had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this work in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum.&rsquo;  Inclusive education and diversity is one of the eight principles of teaching and learning proposed.  One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able to understand, interpret and use different forms of communication including gesture, expression, spoken language (English, Irish and other languages), printed text, broadcast media, and digital media.  Phase one of the consultation on the draft Framework is complete.  Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will opportunity for the NCCA to have continued engagement with children and teachers who use ISL in schools and to learn from their experiences.  It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.</p><p>At post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: <i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests. </p></reply>

These also detail a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over unregistered people.  </p>  <p>  A number of measures are already in place to support the supply of substitute teachers to schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include the establishment of primary school supply panels nationwide, the relaxation of the rules governing career breaks and job sharing which facilitates teachers on career break to sub and job-sharers to take up additional hours as subs. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaging with stakeholders to identify other potential measures to support supply. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Teaching Council is communicating with Professional Master of Education (PME) students, via the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), to encourage them to register with the Council and register also their availability with Sub Seeker, the recruitment portal which matches available teachers with substitutable vacancies (www.educationposts.ie/page/subseeker).</p></reply>

Many pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children may attend special schools or classes. </p><p>I wish to advise that, in line with the Act, my Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils and young persons with special educational needs, including children who are Deaf or hard of hearing, to ensure that children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.</p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, work in partnership with parents to advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development.  The NCSE also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language.  The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>As regards the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (the NCCA) is currently reviewing and redeveloping the Primary Curriculum Framework NCCA have had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this work in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum.&rsquo;  Inclusive education and diversity is one of the eight principles of teaching and learning proposed.  One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able to understand, interpret and use different forms of communication including gesture, expression, spoken language (English, Irish and other languages), printed text, broadcast media, and digital media.  Phase one of the consultation on the draft Framework is complete.  Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will opportunity for the NCCA to have continued engagement with children and teachers who use ISL in schools and to learn from their experiences.  It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.</p><p>At post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at <i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests.</p><p>Working along with other Government Departments and agencies, my Department is fully committed to the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is contributing to completion of Ireland&rsquo;s Initial State Report, which will be submitted to the UN later this year.  The policy of my Department is to ensure that all children with special education needs are provided with an education appropriate to their needs and where possible within mainstream placements with additional supports provided.</p></reply>

The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.</p><p>As regards the curriculum at post primary school level,  The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: <i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests. </p></reply>

At primary level, there was a survey of school principals which relied largely on subjective assessment using socio-economic variables.  At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards, was used. </p>  <p>  Following the DEIS Review process, and informed by consultation with education partners, my Department introduced an objective statistics based model for identifying schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme. The key data sources for the new model are the latest available school enrolment data from the POD and PPOD systems and the latest data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. The HP Deprivation Index is increasingly used by Government Departments and Agencies to more effectively allocate resources in the context of socio-economic deprivation. </p>  <p>  Following the application of this model in 2017, a further 79 schools were included in the DEIS programme and 30 schools were upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  As proposed in the DEIS plan additional work on refinement of the model has taken place in the interim. An extensive body of work has been undertaken in terms of the refinement of this model and a detailed analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group. This group contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. My Department has commenced a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspects and implementation of the model, and work is now ongoing on final elements of the model. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the culmination of this work will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need. </p>  <p>  Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

These marks will be provided following an in-school alignment process and will be approved at school level. The main purpose of the alignment process is to ensure that all teachers who are providing estimated percentage marks in respect of the same subject in the school are applying standards that are appropriate and are consistent with each other when doing so.</p>  <p>  Research makes clear that because teacher judgements are made in the context of each school, they need to be examined and adjusted at a national level to ensure comparability across different schools and that a common national standard is applied. The school estimated percentage marks will be combined with recent national data through a process called standardisation in order to generate SEC Accredited Grades. This standardisation process will seek to mitigate the effects that can arise from different schools, despite their best efforts, applying different standards in their estimation. The process of standardisation at national level will ensure as much fairness as possible amongst this year&rsquo;s candidates.</p>  <p>  The standardisation process will not use historical school by school data on past performance in Leaving Certificate Examinations. Data on the Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2021, recent national Leaving Certificate results data and the national distribution of students&rsquo; results may form part of this process. Further details of the process will be determined, taking account of advice from the State Examinations Commission (SEC).</p>  <p>  The SEC Accredited Grade and examinations outcomes will have regard to the pattern of results in 2020 and previously.</p></reply>

This includes an assessment by the AEARS of the educational provision to determine if the child is in receipt of a certain minimum education in line with ministerial guidance. Further information, and detailed guidance for parents in relation to this application and assessment process is available on the Tusla website at: www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-support/alternative-education-assessment-and-registration-service/.</p>  <p>  In line with the current guidelines issued by the government regarding the on-going Covid-19 public health restrictions, the AEARS is working closely with families to make arrangements to carry out assessments of home education in line with public health guidance.</p></reply>

The report shows the curriculum for the following subjects all include specific opportunities for engagement with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 &ndash; Climate Change:</p><p>Primary History, Primary Geography, Primary Science, Primary SPHE</p><p>JC Business Studies, JC Home Economics, JC Science, JC History, JC CSPE</p><p>LC Ag. Science, LC Geography, LC Politics &amp;amp; Society</p><p>Other subjects would contain non-specific opportunities for engagement, for example a language class could be asked to write an essay on an ESD related topic and so on. </p><p>Under the National Strategy, the Department also provides a dedicated ESD portal through Scoilnet which contains a range of ESD related resources for schools to support their teaching. </p><p>A significant proportion of schools (97%) engage with the Green Schools programme.  Schools also engage with other programmes including the World Wise Global Schools programme, ECO UNESCO, Global Citizenship Schools, SEAI schools programme, EPA programmes and many others.  These programme providers all assist schools to deliver the curriculum in relation to ESD.  </p><p>Large numbers of Schools also participate in a range of national competitions and events where themes of sustainable development are evident such as the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.</p><p>On 20<sup>th</sup>April (Earth Day), Minister Foley and Minister Harris jointly launched a on a follow on National Strategy for ESD to 2030.  This will build on the work done under the 1<sup>st</sup>strategy and will be aligned to UNESCO&rsquo;s Framework for ESD for 2030 which sets out the following 5 key priority areas:</p><p>- Advancing Policy and Policy Coherence, Education and Training: </p><p>- Transforming Learning Environments, </p><p>- Capacity Building for Educators and Trainers, </p><p>- Empowering and mobilising Youth and </p><p>- Accelerating sustainable solutions at local level and engaging with the wider community.</p><p>The public consultation will remain open until the 30<sup>th</sup>June and both Departments will continue to engage with key stakeholders including the school community into the early autumn with a view to publishing a new strategy for ESD to 2030 in early 2022.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue) allocated the husband&rsquo;s Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number to the wife and appended a &ldquo;W&rdquo; to the end, as a second check character, so that they could be separately identified but linked for joint assessment.   </p>  <p>  The Finance Act 1993 provided that either spouse could be the assessable spouse, and the practice of allocating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers ceased. From then on, all persons were allocated individual, unique numbers. However, it was decided, at that stage, not to ask all individuals with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them until there was an actual need to do so.</p>  <p>  The Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1998, replacing the RSI Number, and my Department was given legislative responsibility for allocating and managing these new numbers. In practice, the RSI numbers in existence were retained and became PPSNs, including &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers. In other words, Level W numbers are PPSNs in their own right and it is not the case that any person's PPSN is linked with another person. </p>  <p>  It is the case that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners request people with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them once they need to engage with them on taxation matters. The process of replacing a &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number is relatively straightforward. The process is undertaken by staff of the Client Identity Services (CIS) section my Department who can be contacted by phone at LoCall 1890 927 999 or 071 967 2616 or by email at cis.purges@welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks my Department has re-assigned  resources to deal with a build-up of these cases.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.   </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  My Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 (612 DEIS and 95 non-DEIS) primary schools in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. </p>  <p>  As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected.  Of the 189 schools selected, 171 (90.5%) are DEIS and 18 (9.5%) are non-DEIS.</p>  <p>  Both schools referred to by the Deputy submitted an Expression of Interest for the Hot Meals Scheme. They have separate roll numbers and are two separate entities despite the fact they are located on the same site.  Unfortunately one of the schools was not selected and I appreciate that this is disappointing for the school.  </p>  <p>  We have contacted all schools selected for the Hot Meals Scheme and are in the process of considering responses.  Further consideration will be given to the use of any excess capacity once we have confirmed the position with the selected schools.</p>  <p>  Any further extension of the provision of hot meals will need to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and for up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Certification by a registered medical professional is required to support any claim for the special Covid-19 illness payment.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  Only one contribution is required in the four weeks before the claim, thereby making the payment more accessible.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation. </p>  <p>  When the enhanced payment was introduced, it was intended for people who were self-isolating or in a medical facility.  Subsequently the HSE and the Department of Health introduced another category - for people who were advised to restrict their movements.  </p>  <p>  My Department treats a medical Certificate of Incapacity for Work for someone self-isolating in exactly the same way as a certificate for someone restricting their movements.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.</p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation. </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  Given the comprehensive set of supports available to people who are unable to work due to illness, I do not propose to extend the duration of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-05a.1125.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050500078#WRU01600"><p>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.</p>  <p>  In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for 1 year.  As the Deputy may be aware, CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland or QQI major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to 2 years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for 3 years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.  A number of CE participants who are aged over 55 who commenced on the scheme before 2017 can stay on CE for six consecutive years.  Therefore, CE participants across a range of cohorts have considerable periods of time to complete the training and development elements of CE.  Training and work experience received by CE participants are important components of the CE schemes which I fully support.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has continued to provide funding and support for CE schemes since the onset of the Covid-19 emergency in March 2020.  Furthermore, a number of CE schemes, which provide essential community services, have been in a position to continue to deliver these services, while complying with the public health restrictions that have been in place during each period of restrictions.</p>  <p>  During the periods of Level-5 restrictions, those CE participants, whose contracts were due to end, have had their contracts extended for the duration of those restrictions.  In early March 2021, Minister Humphreys and I announced funding for a further CE contract extension for participants, up until 2nd July 2021.  Over 7,000 CE and T&uacute;s participants will benefit from this latest contract extension, that applies to all participants whose contracts were due to finish since end-October 2020.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that when CE participants are eventually due to finish on their respective schemes, this will be undertaken on a coordinated, phased basis over a number of months, providing further opportunities for the completion of training and additional  work experience.  </p>  <p>  Some CE participant training has continued online during the Level-5 restrictions.  However, where a CE participant finishes up on their CE scheme without completing the training outlined in their Individual Learning Plan and if unfortunately, they remain unemployed, they may continue their development through a range of training supports provided by my Department such as the Training Support Grant and the Back to Education Allowance.  Department case officers will engage with former CE participants to discuss the available options.</p>  <p>  Contract extension dates will continue to be monitored in line with Government public health restrictions in place over the coming months.  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  It is not proposed to further-extend participant contracts at this juncture.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

The specific lots will be detailed in the RFT when published. The forthcoming RFT will place due emphasis on the quality of services to be provided, while expanding the capacity of the Public Employment Service (PES). </p>  <p>  My Department has obtained legal advice that employment assistance and advice services must be procured though open competitive procurement processes in line with EU and national procurement rules. </p>  <p>  In practice, the current annual "costs-met" funding approach requires a level of scrutiny of day-to-day expenditure, which places an undue administrative burden on both the employment service provider and my Department.  Such an approach diverts valuable resources away from supporting clients and, as such, does nothing to enhance employment outcomes for the long-term unemployed. Moving to a new multi-annual funding approach, which pays for each jobseeker referred to the service, coupled with a strong emphasis on quality of service provision is more likely to deliver on a consistent basis enhanced outcomes for those availing of the service. </p>  <p>  Separately, the current contracts for all contracted PES provision expire at the end of 2021 and my Department is therefore developing RFTs to ensure that sufficient high-quality employment services are procured in a manner that is compatible with EU and national procurement rules.   </p>  <p>  The need to expand employment services to ensure a State-wide provision of services to the long-term unemployed is not consistent with a more limited pilot scheme, with its narrower application.</p>  <p>  Organisations with strong experience in the delivery of similar services at a community and local level will be in a strong position to respond to the RFTs when they issue.</p></reply>

As a result of this change, US and Canadian banks levied cross border payment charges on their own customers' Irish pension payments.  </p>  <p>  Payments to markets outside Ireland where the sending bank is not a member of the domestic clearing system, such as the US or Canada, are processed as international cross border payments, also known as &lsquo;international wire transfers&rsquo;.  Processing such payments as international wire transfers ensures that the sending bank complies with its national and international Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations.  In order to effect these international wire transfers in markets such as the US and Canada, the services of correspondent banks are necessary, and their use is the industry standard approach. </p>  <p>  Correspondent banks will deduct charges from the payment amount to compensate for the cost of processing the payment and discharging their AML and CTF obligations. </p>  <p>  For payments to the United States of America, Danske Bank has negotiated a reduction in the wire transfer fee on Irish Social Welfare payments with its correspondent bank.</p>  <p>  For Social Welfare payments to Canada, Danske Bank initially routed all the payments through its main correspondent bank in the country.  While a correspondent bank can process payments to most Canadian banks, there are some financial institutions for which the assistance of another intermediary bank is required to complete the payment.  In these instances, the payee may be charged wire transfer fees by each intermediary bank utilised.</p>  <p>  Following advice from Danske Bank, the Department implemented a change in April to its file generation process.  This system development is to reduce the likelihood of pension payments being routed through more than one Canadian intermediary bank.  This change has been implemented in time for all May pension payments.</p>  <p>  The Department has also amended its Social Welfare payment files to ensure that all pension payments to beneficiaries outside the SEPA zone are clearly marked as pension payments.  This change was in place for all payments to North America in April.  Many bank customers in both Canada and the United States can avail of reduced bank fees on pension payments, depending on the financial institution that they bank with, their fee plan and the type of account that they hold.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection continues to liaise with Danske Bank in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 994,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel to include those with long-term health conditions such as epilepsy, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, would have significant implications for the Free Travel scheme.  It would be expected that any such decision would immediately lead to calls for all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues to be eligible for a free travel pass.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The relevant legislation in this area is the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 which applies to a child born weighing 500 grammes or more, or having a gestational age of 24 weeks or more, who shows no sign of life.

It is important that the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities are integrated into the development of policies and programmes so that they meet their needs effectively.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has funded the development of a Participation and Consultation Network to build capacity within the disability community so that people with disabilities and their representative organisations can participate fully.  The Network was formed in late 2020. One of the Network&rsquo;s first tasks has been to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the Convention.  The Network facilitated a consultation process amongst its membership to complete that task.  </p>  <p>  This Network is an important initiative that will help us to realise both the spirit and the substance of the UNCRPD here in Ireland. It will provide a platform for people with disabilities to become actively involved in issues that affect their lives.</p></reply>

I have directly engaged with survivors and advocacy groups since my appointment and will continue to engage with those most centrally involved with these matters.</p>  <p>  In responding to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government approved the development of a Strategic Action Plan encompassing a suite of 22 specific measures.  These measures, which take account of the Commission's recommendations and those of the Collaborative Forum, are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families. This is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I am working with colleagues in Government to advance these measures. </p>  <p>  Most importantly, I am committed to implementing a survivor-centred approach characterised by consistent engagement with former residents and their representative groups, including those who live outside the jurisdiction. Notably, several hundred survivors have contacted my Department since the report was published, many of whom had never been in contact with us before. An increased level of engagement is also evident from the consultation process established to inform development of a Restorative Recognition Scheme, with approximately 450 written submissions received and 159 participants in seventeen online meetings. </p>  <p>  It is clear, therefore, that new demands emerge in seeking to facilitate dialogue and consultation on the Commission&rsquo;s Final Report and the State&rsquo;s Action Plan. Stakeholder engagement at this level requires additional dedicated structures, processes and resources to ensure it can be inclusive and effective. To this end, I am currently consulting with members of the Collaborative Forum, as I believe that learning from existing processes can assist in developing new and enhanced approaches as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I held two virtual meetings with members of the Collaborative Forum in February during which the structures necessary to support future stakeholder engagement was a specific agenda item. In recognising the limited time available during plenary discussions, my department requested the facilitator to the Forum to further engage with members in one to one sessions. I look forward to hearing their feedback when this process is completed.  </p>  <p>  At present, there are four vacancies on the Collaborative Forum in addition to the position of Chair. There have been a number of resignations and replacements since the Forum's establishment in 2018 but I have no plan to appoint further members within the current Forum structure. My preference at this juncture is to focus attention on developing a new model capable of supporting wider, sustained engagement with stakeholders. The experience of Forum members, and other stakeholders with whom I have engaged, will assist the development and transition to a new model of engagement. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Collaborative Forum&rsquo;s report, it was not possible to publish the report when it was submitted to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs because of concerns that its contents encroached upon the work of the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  For this reason, the Forum's recommendations were initially published and a commitment was given to revisit the question of publication following the completion of the Commission's work. Arrangements are being advanced by my Department to address the procedural requirement for identifiable parties to be afforded due process prior to publication. </p>  <p>  I expect this process to be completed in the coming weeks. I will then be in a position to engage further with the Collaborative Forum and finalise arrangements for the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  Communication by my Department with the Forum is conducted primarily through the secretariat to the Forum. Most recently there has been contact with members in relation to the invitation for Forum representatives to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability and Integration in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill.</p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee has held a number of meetings dedicated to pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of this Bill. I was pleased to see the Committee provide a dedicated session on Tuesday 27 April to engage with members of the Collaborative Forum. My Department has previously provided briefings and information to the Forum in the course of developing legislative proposals for this important intervention. I welcome the priority the Committee has afforded this pre-legislative scrutiny and look forward to further engagement with the Committee on this and related matters.</p></reply>

As such, a new full public procurement will take place in 2021 with the aim of securing the additional spaces required to end the use of emergency accommodation by IPAS.</p>  <p>  The procurement will have a specific focus on the provision of child friendly accommodation that will allow parents and children to enjoy a normal private family life.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware a new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by the IPAS.  The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for International Protection from the beginning of February. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. Assessment questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE.</p>  <p>  A new Resident Welfare Team has been established within IPAS to case-manage individual families, and single residents, identified as having special reception needs and to ensure that those needs continue to be identified and addressed in the most appropriate way possible.  The Resident Welfare Team will be a multi-disciplinary team with experts from the fields of education, health and childcare seconded.    </p>  <p>  IPAS is also committed to working with Tusla during 2021 to develop interagency protocols and operating procedures that will support the sharing of case information between Tusla and IPAS and to track and monitor referrals and cases from beginning to end. </p>  <p>  All existing centres and all new centres are required to develop a child safeguarding statement.  IPAS will work with Tusla to ensure compliance with child safeguarding statements and Children First legislation is audited this year.  IPAS will be ensuring that child safeguarding statements are translated and made available to all residents. Additional child safety training will also be rolled out to all centre managers as COVID restrictions allow.  </p>  <p>  A new dedicated Customer Services Team has also been established in IPAS and, as well as strengthening the existing resident complaints system, this team will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through customer feedback mechanisms and focus groups in the months ahead.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I published A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a New International Protection Support Service on 26 February 2021. The new model has the human rights of children at its core. The new International Protection system will respect the rights of children and will provide child-friendly services, including a child-friendly vulnerability assessment. This was agreed with the OCO during the development of the White Paper.</p></reply>

Regrettably, it has not always been possible to meet this target, due to capacity issues and, most recently, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  A total of 96 inspections were carried out in 2018, with 23 centres being inspected three times and 14 being inspected less than three times. 103 inspections were carried out in 2019, with 25 of the 39 centres that were open during the course of that year being inspected at least three times. With the exception of a new centre that opened in Dominick Street in Galway, which was not fully occupied until late 2020, all accommodation centres were inspected at least once in 2020; 24 were inspected twice; and twelve were inspected three times. This gives a total of 92 inspections carried out in 2020. In a written answer to Deputy Catherine Connolly on 21 January 2021, this figure was incorrectly given as 94.</p>  <p>  While emergency accommodation is not subject to formal inspections, IPAS officials are in regular contact with residents through clinics, which are now conducted online. Residents can make use of the IPAS complaints mechanism and can also raise issues through the confidential telephone support service which the Jesuit Refugee Service provides on behalf of the Department. In addition, all residents can raise matters of concern with both the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. Where issues are raised by or on behalf of residents, IPAS will address the matter with the accommodation provider and will visit the premises as required to ensure that any issues are satisfactorily resolved.</p></reply>

I am also acutely aware that there are circumstances when there is a need for special arrangements for children their services seek to support. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is fairer and more far-reaching than the legacy targeted support schemes. It removes many of the very restrictive eligibility requirements, linked to Social Protection payments or a Medical Card, which were previously associated with accessing childcare support. Moving to this new system has been a significant step forward in combating the poverty traps inherent in the legacy schemes. </p><p>Under the legacy schemes there were some families with low income-levels who were not able to access subsidised childcare, either because they are in low-paid employment or because they are rotating between short periods of employment, unemployment and training. The NCS has changed this. </p><p>In replacing the legacy schemes, the NCS aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities. </p><p>At a broad and simplified level, our maximum subsidy rates compare well overall with the legacy targeted scheme subsidy rates, while acknowledging that the schemes do not lend themselves to easy comparison:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Age and Education Stage </th>       <th>NCS Max Subsidy Payment per week in term-time? </th>       <th>Max CCSP payment per week </th>       <th>Max TEC payment per week (this includes the Community Employment   Childcare Scheme)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child under 1 </td>       <td>&euro;229.50? </td>       <td>&euro;145 </td>       <td>&euro;145 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child 1- 3 years </td>       <td>&euro;197.75 </td>       <td>&euro;145 </td>       <td>&euro;145 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Preschool child </td>       <td>&euro;118.50? </td>       <td>&euro;80 (but could claim full rate if more than 8 hours per day in cr&egrave;che) </td>       <td>&euro;80 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>School-age </td>       <td>&euro;82.50? </td>       <td>&euro;80 (part-time) or &euro;45 (afterschool sessional) </td>       <td>&euro;45 (plus top-up) </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive, to meet the needs of the most economically vulnerable children and those living with other forms of disadvantage. I will keep the Scheme under review, and I will continue to work with my officials to identify whether any refinements are needed to ensure that it delivers for those most in need.</p><p>As an immediate response, support is available to services like this through Case Management. My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services experiencing difficulties. Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering on-the-ground case management assistance. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.</p><p>Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. Normally, financial supports are only available for community services. However, there is a COVID-19 Impact Support funding strand available in 2021, which is for both Community and Private services.</p><p>The CCC should be the first point of contact for any service seeking support; I would therefore urge this service to contact their local CCC as soon as possible if they have not done so already.</p></reply>

My Department is actively working with Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) to put in place, on a sustainable basis, the necessary resources that are required to implement these new statutory functions. </p>  <p>  With regard to Section 23 of the Act referred to by the Deputy, the policy intention of this Section is to underpin the statutory basis for all qualifications to be included within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and to open access to the NFQ for a wider range of awarding bodies than it has pertained to, to date. An important provision under Section 23 will be the establishment of a new class of awarding body, to be known as a Listed Awarding Body, eligible to offer qualifications that are included within the NFQ. </p>  <p>  Many useful qualifications are currently available outside of the NFQ, including qualifications offered by professional, sectoral and international bodies.  It is the intention that in the future such bodies will be able to seek, on a voluntary basis, regulated access to the NFQ. The opening up of the NFQ to a broader range of qualifications is a commitment in our National Skills Strategy, it is consistent with best practice internationally, and is a policy direction supported under EU ambition for a European Education Area and the delivery of the European Skills Agenda.  </p>  <p>  In order for this Section of the legislation to be commenced it will be necessary for QQI in the first instance to develop the policies and criteria for Listed Awarding Bodies and the Inclusion of Awards in the NFQ. This is envisaged by the end of 2021.  This Section of the legislation can then be commenced following QQI's consultation on the relevant policies and criteria.</p></reply>

Further information in relation to the nationality requirements are available from SUSI's website:<i></i></p><p>Permission to remain in the State on the basis of a Stamp 3 Visa does not meet the nationality requirements of the Student Grant Scheme 2021. However, article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 provides for a review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted one of the permission to remain criterion provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for student grant assistance is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

Section 34 of this Act amends Section 80 of the <i>Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act </i>2012, which authorises the charging of fees for certain services provided by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the national agency responsible for qualifications and quality assurance in further education and training and higher education in Ireland.  </p><p>The 2012 Act requires that quality assurance underpins the relationship between QQI and the education providers with which it engages.  The 2012 Act ensured that the existing quality assurance relationships that providers had with QQI&rsquo;s predecessor agencies were maintained until providers could agree new quality assurance arrangements with QQI.  The term &lsquo;re-engagement&rsquo; is used to describe this transition. Public providers have a statutory obligation to re-engage with QQI while private and independent providers re-engage on a voluntary basis.</p><p>The re-engagement process allows providers to demonstrate their capacity to provide and maintain, on an ongoing and sustainable basis, the infrastructure required to develop education programmes consistent with national standards and to assess the achievement of stated learning outcomes by learners.  It will happen only once for each provider. Thereafter, the provider will have to undergo periodic review of the effectiveness of its quality assurance procedures.</p><p>QQI works with a diverse range of public and private providers in higher and further education and training as well as providers in the English language education sector.  The level of QQI fees to be applied for the purposes of re-engagement were subject to extensive deliberation to ensure that they are applied equitably.  These fees reflect a graduated system based on the provider&rsquo;s scope of provision including a provider&rsquo;s highest level of award on the National Framework of Qualifications and the volume of a provider&rsquo;s validated programmes.  </p><p>All of the public higher education institutions and the Education and Training Boards have now completed the re-engagement process with QQI.  The re-engagement process for private and independent providers commenced in 2018 and continues apace.  At this stage of the process it would not be fair, equitable, objective or justifiable to introduce a fee waiver scheme for re-engagement.</p></reply>

In the event that a union has specific concerns regarding work and contract conditions among staff in any third level institution, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.

It is my understanding that a number of HEIs currently offer courses or modules involving Irish Sign Language (ISL). </p>  <p>  Trinity College Dublin, through its Centre for Deaf Studies offers a number of courses that allow students to learn or improve in ISL. The most comprehensive of these is the Bachelor in Deaf Studies, a four year honours degree course which provides a comprehensive introduction to the Deaf Community and ISL. It includes pathways for those to wish to enter ISL teaching or ISL/English interpreting.</p>  <p>  Trinity&rsquo;s Centre for Deaf Studies also offers at ten-week part-time Introduction to Irish Sign Language, and a 24 week Irish Sign Language for Beginners Course.</p>  <p>  The Institute of Education at Dublin City University has developed a Bachelor of Education - Irish Sign Language Pathway (Restricted Entry) as a pilot programme and is awaiting approval for the course from the Department of Education. The Bachelor of Education (ISL) will prepare students for a career as a Primary School Teacher in the deaf education sector where they can make a lasting impact on young deaf and hard of hearing children and on society.</p>  <p>  University College Dublin (UCD) offer an Applied Language Centre module for students who have no previous knowledge of Irish Sign Language (ISL). The aim is for students to develop a basic knowledge of signs so that they are able to participate in simple everyday communicative situations. </p>  <p>  The Munster Technological University (MTU) offers a Certificate in Irish Sign Language (ISL) as a special purpose award. The Certificate in Irish Sign Language gives students access to practical ISL skills and insight into the world of the Irish deaf community.

An investment under the IIP does not confer any preferential entitlement to citizenship or an Irish passport. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants under the IIP and their nominated family members may be granted a residence permission in Ireland under Stamp 4 conditions. Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland. Any successful IIP applicant wishing to attain citizenship by naturalisation would have to submit an application that meets the criteria as provided for in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.</p>  <p>  The IIP was introduced in April 2012 to encourage inward investment so as to create business and employment opportunities in the State. There are currently four options for investing, one of which is the endowment of &euro;500,000 (or &euro;400,000 where a group of 5 or more combine to make a large endowment) towards a project of public benefit in the arts, sports, health, cultural or educational field. A number of such community projects have been approved for IIP investment under the scheme to date.</p>  <p>  Projects seeking funding under the IIP are assessed by an Independent Evaluation Committee, comprised of senior civil and public servants from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies involved in enterprise development in Ireland.  The Evaluation Committee convenes at least four times a year to assess projects submitted for consideration under the Programme. </p>  <p>  The Evaluation Committee makes a determination as to whether a project is suitable for IIP investment and if deemed suitable, the application will be submitted to me for final approval. </p>  <p>  Any endowment proposed should be regarded as a philanthropic contribution with a clear public benefit and investors will receive no financial return or recoupment of the principal sum invested. Any successful endowment project must provide a benefit to the public that is enduring and not one that is no longer sustainable once the endowment funding ceases. In addition, the IIP is focused on supporting projects that are investment ready. A criteria for establishing same is that planning permission, where required, has been granted.</p></reply>

The work of the Taskforce is ongoing and has included wide stakeholder engagement. A key challenge identified by stakeholders is the outdated alcohol licensing legislation and this will be reflected in the report of the Taskforce. We are working with Minister Catherine Martin and the Taskforce to ensure we can deliver on work of the Taskforce and its recommendations without delay and that is why we set out commitments in the Justice Plan 2021 on this major legislative reform in line with our Programme for Government commitments. It is my firm intention that this reform will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to bring forward legislation that will contain proposals to update the law relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs, by replacing both the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 with streamlined provisions more suited to modern conditions.</p>  <p>  While the work of the Night Time Economy Taskforce is well-advanced, work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws more generally is at an early stage of development.  I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to engage constructively with stakeholders as that work progresses.</p>  <p>  In terms of assessing whether a review of legislation is required in relation to the delivery of alcohol, it is essential that there is a clear understanding of what the current regulations are under existing legislation.</p>  <p>  While there is no dedicated licence for online sales of intoxicating liquor, licensees of licensed premises may engage in online sales subject to certain restrictive conditions. Under existing legislation where alcohol is purchased online, the same restrictions on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor apply, including the restrictions in relation to hours of trading and the provisions in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons.</p>  <p>  There is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased substantially. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends that require further regulation. It is in that context and in light of the planned updating of the alcohol licensing legislation we are considering appropriate regulation of this service.</p></reply>

However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.</p><p>The average processing time for applications in recent years, as requested by the Deputy, is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Spouse/Civil Partner of an Irish Citizen</th>       <th>All Applications</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>7.8</td>       <td>5.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>6.9</td>       <td>7.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>10.7</td>       <td>10.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>12.4</td>       <td>11.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>12.4</td>       <td>13.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>23.6</td>       <td>24.3</td>    </tr> </table> A number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past two years. A High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, resulted in significant delays. As well as this, a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in-person ceremonies during Covid-19. The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time. However, it is important to note that my Department&rsquo;s Immigration Service did not suspend the receipt or processing of applications at any stage during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service. In some instances, the input of several public agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>A significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. On 18 January 2021, a temporary system was opened that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. </p><p>My Department achieved the target of communicating with 4,000 people by the end of March 2021, most of whom have been in the system over 30 months. Around 1,708 people have received their Irish citizenship since then. A further 1,057 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and the Immigration Service will be sending them their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.</p><p>It has also been decided to extend the statutory declaration process to a further 2,500 people by the end of June. At that point, my Department will have communicated with all those that were recorded, as at 30 December 2020, as having been in the system 24 months or more and 6,500 people will have been given the opportunity to complete their Irish citizenship.</p><p>In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured. </p><p>Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are also well advanced, in line with the plan to significantly modernise the justice sector through increased digital and ICT investment. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in such decisions.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>It is important to note that, to date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society, including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, as the Deputy is aware, community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda Operating Model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under 'A Policing Service for Our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department also recently published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. The Bill sets out a statutory framework at national and local level to drive the delivery of community safety, including the establishment of local Community Safety Partnerships. The Partnerships, which will replace and build upon Joint Policing Committees, will each develop local community safety plans that respond to the specific needs of their community. Membership will include local representatives, service provides and a range of community representatives who will work in partnership, supported by dedicated staff. </p><p>The table below, which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of community Garda&iacute; assigned to each Wicklow District at 31 March 2021, the latest date for which figures are available.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Wicklow Division </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Baltinglass District </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bray District </td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow District </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>10</td>    </tr> </table> A detailed breakdown of the Garda workforce, including the national distribution of Community Garda&iacute;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website in the interests of transparency and for the convenience of Deputies and the wider public.

Documentation was requested by my Department by letter dated 2 September 2019. This documentation remains outstanding and the application can only be progressed upon its receipt.</p>  <p>  I recognise the crucial role healthcare workers are continuing to play in responding to the threat of COVID-19. They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have played a vital part in preventing the spread of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant and statistics are not maintained by the Immigration Service of my Department to enable me to provide details of the profession of applicants. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  A significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during COVID-19. On 18 January 2021, a temporary system that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty was opened and approximately 1,708 people have received their Irish citizenship since then. A further 1,057 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and the Immigration Service will be sending them their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It has also been decided to extend the statutory declaration process to a further 2,500 people and by the end of June, it is expected that 6,500 people will have been given the opportunity to complete their Irish citizenship. </p>  <p>  In-person citizenship ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured. </p>  <p>  Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with the plan to significantly modernise the Justice Sector through increased digital and ICT investment. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner.</p></reply>

The fund is not impacting on structures for community safety partnerships, it is intended to support such initiatives.</p>  <p>  It will reflect the significant successes of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau in disrupting criminal activity and seizing proceeds of crime, by providing additional funding for investment in community safety projects.

The Commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. This new policy will be given a statutory basis in a new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, the General Scheme of which was recently approved by Government. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years. </p>  <p>  These Partnerships will operate at local authority administrative level and replace and build upon Joint Policing Committees.

The intention is that where local safety fora are active, the Local Safety Partnerships will serve as a useful forum to which they can escalate any issues as appropriate, and gain access to a range of service providers. </p>  <p>  The pilots will inform the development of the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area as part of the provisions of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill.</p></reply>

A requirement of the scheme involves Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Medical Doctors making a clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant meets the specified medical criteria for a Primary Medical Certificate.</p>  <p>  Following a Supreme Court decision in June 2020, the assessment process for Primary Medical Certificates had to be suspended.  While the approval of the Finance Act 2020 paved the way for assessments to recommence this year, the Community Medical Doctors have also played a key role in the National COVID-19 response, including the roll out of the vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  I have been working with the HSE to ensure that the outstanding applications for Primary Medical Certificates are processed as a matter of urgency.  HSE data indicates that 401 assessments were carried out between January and March 2021.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to monitor progress on these assessments in the context of the HSE Service Recovery and Restoration Plan.  I intend to keep the matter under review, to ensure that we continue to work our way through outstanding applications.</p>  <p>  As the issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter, I have referred the question to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  </p><p>In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. </p><p>The announcement made last week include the following changes to the measures applying to weddings: as of May 10, there can be an increase in the number of guests attending wedding services to 50 which brings this figure in line with the numbers permitted at religious services.  </p><p>This increase to 50 guests relates to the service (both religious or civil) only. The number of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception should remain at 6 guests for indoor gatherings and 15 guests for outdoor gatherings. From 7 June, subject to the epidemiological situation at the time, it is envisaged that the numbers of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception will increase to 25. The Government has indicated that a further range of activities, including numbers attending indoor and outdoor events, will be considered at the end of June.

There has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. In February, the Taoiseach met with representatives of the Catholic Church to discuss the Covid-19 restrictions and the Church&rsquo;s desire to return to worship.

This Government&rsquo;s priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including Scoliosis.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021.</p>  <p>  It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, a decrease in activity of 16% compared with 2019.</p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that they are working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh to expand orthopaedic capacity. This is expected to have a positive impact on orthopaedic long waiting patients, including reductions in waiting times for children with scoliosis. CHI is also running additional orthopaedic clinics in City West, using a new active clinical triage model, which is reducing the number of children waiting the longest for appointments.</p>  <p>  Representatives of CHI, the Orthopaedic Spinal Team and the Advocacy Groups continue to meet as part of the Co-Design framework on a quarterly basis to work on providing solutions for patients in the spinal service.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised regarding the number of children waiting over four months for a scoliosis operation and the number of children waiting over 12 months for a scoliosis operation, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p><p>The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation. </p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding waiting lists at Mayo University Hospital and Galway University Hospital, is outlined in the attached document. The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.  In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of March 2021 there were 4,226 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,268 in March 2019.</p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).

The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.  In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.  The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p></reply>

Progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens. By working together, the Irish people have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease.<b></b>We all must continue to do everything possible to avoid the virus spreading.</p><p>The restrictions on social interaction, the requirement for self-isolation and the restructuring of services, can be particularly difficult for<b></b>people who use drugs or are dependent on alcohol.</p><p>The Department of Health is committed to the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services<b>, </b>including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p><p>The Department has developed guidance for drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes in recognition of their important role in helping individuals to build recovery capital and to avoid relapse into harmful patterns of substance use. The guidance applies at all levels of the<i></i>national framework for living with Covid-19. </p><p>The guidance on facilities and attendance at support groups and programmes is as follows: </p><p>- Facilities used to host groups and programmes should not be shared with other users, where possible. </p><p>- There should be separate entry and exit points, management of queues to avoid congestion and thorough cleaning of rooms and toilets before and after use.  </p><p>- Facilities should be airy and well ventilated. </p><p>- The maximum number of participants is 15 people (including leaders). The specific number should be determined by the capacity of the venue to ensure 2 metres social distance and should be adjusted accordingly in smaller venues.  </p><p>- At high levels of transmission, it is recommended that the number of participants is reduced. </p><p>- Face coverings should be worn indoors at all times.  </p><p>- Support groups and programmes should have a maximum duration of 90 minutes and should be shortened when the risk of transmission is high. </p><p>- Leaders or participants should only attend one group or programme. </p><p>- People in residential treatment settings should not attend external support groups at this time. </p><p>Recently, the Government decided to move ahead with the Recovery and Resilience: The Path Ahead plan. We are now in the early stages of the Recovery phase of the pandemic. The National Vaccination Programme is well advanced and thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the Irish people, there has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community. </p><p>The decision is based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), that a cautious and gradual phased reopening over May and June, with an emphasis on outdoor activity and a moderate increase in social contact, can be considered low to medium risk. NPHET has advised that there is scope to ease a range of public health measures in this manner with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact.  </p><p>This allows us to continue through the Recovery phase, focusing on what is safest and generates the most benefit and with a focus on outdoors activities &ndash; both social and economic. Think safe, think outdoors &ndash; this must be our theme for the Summer of 2021.</p><p>I welcome the reopening of society from May onwards. However, indoor events remain higher risk. I would advise support groups to continue to proceed with caution in line with the latest guidance. A review of the guidance can take place when restrictions on indoor events are lifted in due course.</p></reply>

The HSE is planning for the production of vaccine certificates at part of its implementation planning for a COVID-19 vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  Immunity certificates are problematic on a number of grounds.  It is not yet clear if the proposed vaccines for COVID-19 actually stop people getting the virus.  It is also not clear whether the thresholds for protective immunity are the same in all groups e.g. older persons or those who are immunosuppressed. </p>  <p>  On 17 March 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for a Regulation to introduce a &lsquo;Digital Green Certificate&rsquo; to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  This proposed regulation lays down a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates to facilitate people&rsquo;s fundamental right to move and reside freely within the EU. Possession of a Digital Green Certificate shall not be a precondition to exercise free movement rights. Careful consideration is being given to the proposal and its many policy, ethical, infrastructural and operational implications across a number of sectors.</p>  <p>  Vaccine/immunity certificates can be used in ways that may conceivably both restrict and promote the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Department is currently examining the impact such certificates could have on public trust and solidarity, as well as their potential for discrimination and stigmatisation of certain individuals/groups in society.  Questions of national as well as international equity are being considered, as are the privacy implications of introducing such digital certificates.  The ethical and human rights issues attendant to this issue will be considered as part of the broader policy position.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p><p>Unaccompanied minors who have travelled from or through a designated state in the 14 days prior to arrival in Ireland will not be permitted to enter a mandatory quarantine facility alone.  To board a flight/ferry to Ireland, an unaccompanied minor must produce a negative RT-PCR test within the last 72 hours and their passport.</p><p>Their adult guardian can enter mandatory hotel quarantine with them, however, if this is not possible a responsible adult collecting the unaccompanied minor must sign a guardian release letter undertaking in writing the legal responsibility for ensuring that, the unaccompanied minor, will complete the mandatory 14-day quarantine at a specified address and that it is possible to effectively isolate at the said address.In instances where an unaccompanied minor is arriving in Ireland to attend boarding school, a school representative must present themselves to Irish Immigration authorities with proper identification and on arrival, they will fill in, sign and return the Guardian Release Letter to the Irish immigration official. It is a criminal offence to give misleading or fraudulent information to an Irish immigration official.</p><p>Arrangements are also in place with Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) to provide suitable accommodation for any unaccompanied child arriving from designated states who is required to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine under Tusla's care.</p><p>As of 17th April, passengers who are fully vaccinated and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance.  Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered &lsquo;fully vaccinated&rsquo;.</p><p>  Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p><p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers.  All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p><p>Further information can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.</p></reply>

The overall risk of severe illness in pregnancy is low.  However, pregnant women with COVID-19 infection are more likely to develop serious disease or to die than either pregnant women without COVID-19 or similar aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19.

The proposers argue that this would allow countries to scale up the manufacture of such products.</p><p>  International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties and in exercising that competence, the European Commission engages fully with the Member States through a variety of Committees and Working Parties/Groups, including on Intellectual Property.</p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s current position on the proposed waiver is that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by India and South Africa.  Specifically, the TRIPS agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits someone else to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p><p>  The EU position is that manufacturing capacity, access to raw materials and distribution networks are the main obstacles that need to be overcome in the supply of vaccines and that increasing manufacturing capacity may be better attained through voluntary licensing arrangements by disseminating the technology and know-how of those who developed the vaccines.  The EU Commission has set up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and address supply chain bottlenecks.</p><p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.  Discussions on the proposed waiver are continuing at the WTO.</p><p>The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global access to COVID vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are served by our collective effort. As a member of the global health community, Ireland continues to play an active role in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines for all.  This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p></reply>

The Act also provided for the establishment of the Mental Health Commission, the regulator of mental health services in the State, an Inspector of Mental Health Services within the Commission and safeguards for service users, including the right to a review mechanism through the mental health tribunals process. A 2015 decision by the Government of the day called for a draft general scheme to amend the Act to be produced, in line with the 165 recommendations of the 2015 Expert Group Review report.</p><p>  Among the Expert Group recommendations were proposals on revised criteria for detention, updated definitions of mental illness and voluntary and involuntary patients, the introduction of guiding principles, statutory individual care plans, a greater role for Authorised Officers in involuntary admissions, improved safeguards for service users and shorter intervals for tribunals.  The Expert Group also recommended that there be a presumption of capacity for young people aged 16 and 17 to consent or refuse treatment, unless proven otherwise, and the introduction of guiding principles for the care of children under the Act.</p><p>  The Department is now finalising the draft general scheme to amend the Mental Health Act, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Expert Group, relevant domestic legislation such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, relevant Private Members&rsquo; Bills, the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, extensive consultation with key stakeholders such as the Commission and the HSE, and the results of a recently concluded public consultation, which saw 100 submissions received by the Department.  A legal review of the draft general scheme is currently underway and is expected to conclude shortly. </p><p>  Final comments from key stakeholders such as the Commission and the HSE are expected by the end of April, and the Department will review these final submissions, as well as any submissions received as part of the legal review process, over the next two months, and will inform the final draft legislation.  I expect that Government approval of the draft general scheme will be sought before the D&aacute;il summer recess with a view to it being published as part of the autumn legislative programme.</p></reply>

While recognising this is a difficult rule for persons affected it is deemed a necessary infection prevention and control measure to protect public health.</p>  <p>  The mandatory quarantine system includes a system of appeal, to allow a person in quarantine to request a review of their quarantine. Requests for review of quarantine are submitted to the State Liaison Officer present in each designated facility and are considered by independent appeals officers. Decisions on requests for review are provided within a 24-hour period. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to evaluate wider policy on international travel as informed by the epidemiological situation and public health advice. In this context, regulations have been introduced to allow 'fully vaccinated' persons arriving from designated states to be exempt from Mandatory Hotel Quarantine. </p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>Further information, including the definition of 'fully vaccinated' can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.</p></reply>

The Expert Panel report, which was published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.</p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders. The recommendations of the report are varied and complex, requiring a mix of ongoing operational response to COVID-19 and a longer-term strategic reform. Those strategic reforms are, by their nature, complex and relate to whole of system issues. It is important to note that any such reforms require careful consideration and substantial policy development work. In the case of some recommendations, major legislative reform is required, something that must be approached in a measured and considerate way, to ensure reforms are delivered as intended.</p><p>Two progress reports have been published to date, with the third report due to be completed in the coming months. These reports are available on the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report: Implementation Oversight Team webpage at .  Additionally, survey work of nursing home providers has now commenced.</p><p>Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings. The very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The transmission of the virus into and within nursing homes is multifactorial. As identified by the Nursing Homes Expert Panel, where there is ongoing community transmission, settings like nursing homes are more vulnerable to exposure. </p><p>The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19. The Expert Panel highlighted the value of those supports and recommended their continuation. These supports continue to be provided. </p><p>The range of supports provided to nursing homes include:</p><p>- Enhanced HSE engagement</p><p>- Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams</p><p>- Supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge </p><p>- Serial testing programme for all staff of nursing homes</p><p>- Where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals</p><p>- Suite of focused public health guidance and training resources  </p><p>- Temporary accommodation to nursing home staff to support measures to block the chain of transmission </p><p>- HIQA implemented a Regulatory Assessment Framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak and published an  Infection Prevention and Control Assurance Framework for Nursing Homes</p><p>In addition, a temporary financial support scheme established for private and voluntary nursing homes, has provided over &euro;88.8m in additional funding support as of 29 April. The Scheme opened in April 2020 and was extended until 30 June 2021.</p></reply>

The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders.  The recommendations of the report are varied and complex, are both short-, medium- and longer-term in nature, and require a mix of ongoing operational response to COVID-19 and a longer-term strategic reform. Those strategic reforms are, by their nature, complex and relate to whole of system issues.</p><p>It is important to note that any such reforms require careful consideration and substantial policy development work. In the case of some recommendations, major legislative reform is required, something that must be approached in a measured and considerate way, to ensure reforms are delivered as intended. Costing of the implementation of recommendations is ongoing, along with the implementation of the recommendations. As noted, longer-term consideration is necessary in costing many of the recommendations, due to the major developmental work that is required in order to accurately cost the defined policy objective and the full range of actions needed to deliver same. </p><p>In line with the Government commitment to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel, up to &euro;40m in funding has been secured to directly progress national recommendations in 2021. Up to &euro;5 million in funding has been allocated to HIQA for 2021 for the implementation of the Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, with &euro;3.8 million approved for draw down for the recruitment of substantial additional staff required to progress recommendations, including additional inspectors required to increase the frequency of inspections. Given the significant service and policy reforms recommended, many recommendations are currently in the developmental stage, including considerations of the role of the Community Support Teams, Integrated Infection Prevention and Control Strategy and a range of legislative reform analysis.  It is anticipated that proposals will be considered by the implementation structures in due course and separately, business cases will submitted to the Department for review. </p><p>It is also important to note that significant supports have been provided to nursing homes throughout the pandemic and these supports have been recognised by the  Expert Panel in its recommendations. They include:</p><p>- Enhanced HSE engagement</p><p>- Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams </p><p>-  Supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge.</p><p>- Serial testing programme for all staff of nursing homes.</p><p>- Where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals. </p><p>- Suite of focused public health guidance and training resources.</p><p>- HIQA COVID-19 quality assurance regulatory framework.</p><p>- Temporary accommodation to nursing home staff to support measures to block the chain of transmission. </p><p>The inter-agency Implementation Oversight Team, which was established by the Minister for Health, oversees the implementation of the relevant COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel recommendations, and reports regularly to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Mental Health and Older People. Many of the short- and medium-term recommendations have been commenced or delivered on to date, with work continuing to progress other recommendations.  Two progress reports have been published to date, with the third report due to be completed in the coming months.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here: .</p><p>It is important to note that Cohort 4 includes &lsquo;Chronic neurological disease or condition with evolving ventilatory failure (requiring non-invasive ventilation), for example, motor neurone disease, spinal muscular atrophy'.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.</p><p>In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there are 3,532 people in receipt of the interim payments at March, 2021.</p><p>At the whole of Government level, the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021</i>sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.

The proposed regulation lays down a framework for the issuance, verification, and acceptance of interoperable certificates. The intention is for the digital green certificate to be a temporary measure.</p>  <p>  The Government is keen to ensure that every effort should be made to achieve alignment across the EU in preparing for reopening of international travel for non-essential purposes as soon as it is safe to do so. An interdepartmental group of senior officials from relevant departments have been progressing policy work in respect of the proposed EU Digital Green Certificate and vaccination certificate.</p>  <p>  Operational aspects for the interoperable certificate system are being progressed on a cross-Departmental basis. The software required to create vaccination certificates is being developed, however, the timeframe is very challenging and new operational processes will need to be established to support this service. </p>  <p>  The priority in Ireland at the moment is the core systems that support the rollout of vaccines and regaining and maintaining control over the disease and preventing a further wave of infection, until the vaccination programme can offer a widespread population level of protection.</p></reply>

In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>-  protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>-  facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>-  improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here: .</p></reply>

As set out above, there is still a high level of infection nationally, therefore this phased approach is recommended to ensure that reopening is sustainable. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that indoor restaurant and bar services within hotels and other accommodation facilities must be restricted to overnight guests/residents only. This is currently the case for those staying in these facilities for essential purposes and is also in line with previous practice for these facilities during periods of Level 3 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

The management of cases taken by persons who allege they developed Narcolepsy and/or Cataplexy as a result of receiving the H1N1 vaccine, Pandemrix, is delegated to SCA and, as such, the Government has no role in determining how these cases are conducted. I understand that it is the Agency&rsquo;s preference to resolve claims using mediation where possible and that that has been offered in these cases.</p>  <p>  Separately, an Expert Group was established by the Government in June 2018, chaired by Mr Justice Charles Meenan, to examine the law in relation to personal injuries arising in the healthcare context and to explore alternative mechanisms by which claims could be managed more effectively, particularly from the perspective of the person on whose behalf a claim has been made. Government noted the contents of the Final Report and agreed to its publication on 16 December 2020. The Report contains seventeen recommendations for change, eleven of which relate to the Department of Health. My Department is currently considering these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and my Department have worked together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected. The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services. Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>   The ex-gratia health supports include:</p>  <p>  - clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment; </p>  <p>  - multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts; </p>  <p>  - counselling services for both the individuals and their families; </p>  <p>  - discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed; </p>  <p>  - physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments.</p>  <p>  Treatment and individual medical needs are reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances. </p>  <p>  In conjunction with the above, a centre of excellence for narcolepsy (based in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital) for treating all forms of narcolepsy in adults as well as children transitioning from paediatric services has been in development.  A sleep lab is now complete at this facility, with equipment installed and commissioned.  Additional sleep technicians have also been recruited.  The sleep lab completed its first sleep studies in July 2019.  Sleep studies are now continuing on a regular basis.  A consultant neurologist with specialist interest in sleep medicine and two consultant respiratory physicians with specialist interest in sleep medicine have been appointed.  They have all commenced their full-time positions and are seeing narcolepsy-related referrals in the clinic.  A dietician also joined the service as part of its multidisciplinary team.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2021 identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on gov.ie/quarantine. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act also allow for travellers to request a review of decisions relating to their quarantine; however this can only be undertaken once quarantine has begun.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to evaluate wider policy on international travel as informed by the epidemiological situation and public health advice, including the possibility of future exemptions, such as for certain categories of essential workers. Public health will remain a paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  As of 17th April, passengers who are fully vaccinated and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered 'fully vaccinated'.</p>  <p>  Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p>  <p>  Covid 19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. No vaccine will be used until Market Authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  Further information can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-05a.1631.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050500087#WRDD00700"><p>There has been considerable progress in reducing infection levels since the peak of the wave of infection in late 2020/early 2021 because of the widespread commitment and adherence by the public to the public health measures in place. While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  </p><p>In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p><p>The Government announcement focused in particular on permitted additional outdoor activities, outdoor work and outdoor training. As of May 10, 3 households or 6 people can meet in a private garden while 15 people can meet for organised outdoor gatherings and training. From 7 June, subject to the public health situation at the time, outdoor sport matches can be played with no spectators and outdoor hospitality services can recommence.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the NPHET has consistently advised that outdoor settings are considerably safer than indoor ones based on national and international evidence. This was a key informing principle in the development of the 5 level framework of public health measures last September and in recent Government decisions in relation to easing public health measures. It is important to note, however, that while outdoors is safer, it is not risk-free. It is important to continue to practice social distancing and other safe behaviours when meeting people outdoors and masks should be worn in crowded outdoor spaces. </p><p>HIQA undertook an evidence review on higher-risk environments and activities for the NPHET in November 2020, drawing on national and international evidence. The Review found that while there is consistent evidence that the risk of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 is substantially lower, there is still evidence of transmission occurring in outdoor environments. This is particularly the case when there are large gatherings, where social distancing or the use of face coverings are neglected, and where there is dense congregation and mixing among groups. There are also risks linked to what might precede and follow outdoor gatherings including associated events and activities and shared travel to or from events or activities. The review is available here (.) </p><p>In relation to the data published by the HPSC, the HSE has clarified that this data is limited and will not reflect all cases associated with outside activities. Firstly, it only relates to outbreak data and it is not possible to link every case to a particular outbreak setting. A proportion of cases will also be considered community transmission or are under investigation when the source isn&rsquo;t known. As such, the surveillance data would not capture all cases potentially associated with an outdoor environment/activity. Secondly, there may be outbreak settings that wouldn&rsquo;t be considered as &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; environments but where transmission amongst some cases associated with such outbreaks may have occurred outside (e.g. while congregating/socially interacting outside a building and not maintaining physical distancing etc.). Thirdly, there are indoor ancillary activities associated with outdoor activities as set out above (eg travel to/from activity, changing rooms etc.) that won&rsquo;t be classified as linked to an outdoor event.</p><p>It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, cannabis means any part of the plant of the genus cannabis but excludes the mature stalk and fibre produced from it and the seeds after separation from the rest of the plant. Any other part of the plant not explicitly excluded under the Act is cannabis for the purposes of the Act and should be destroyed by the licensee.  </p><p>Under current legislation the Minister for Health can issue a licence for the growing of hemp from seed varieties specified by the Commission of the European Communities, as being eligible for the purposes of Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 (OJ No. L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 608.).

In line with the Cosmetics Regulation, a cosmetic product on the market must be notified to the European Commission Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) in advance of being placed on the market; products are not notified directly to the HPRA.</p><p>The HPRA conducts reactive and proactive market surveillance of cosmetic products available on the Irish market, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive (HSE). Reactive market surveillance includes investigation of quality-related complaints (compliance cases), reports of adverse events relating to the use of cosmetics (vigilance cases) and Safety Gate RAPEX alerts. From 2017 to 2020, the HPRA initiated 1276 such market surveillance cases.</p><p>Of the 1276 cases, 753 were regarding investigations of potential or confirmed non-compliances of cosmetic products with the requirements of the Cosmetics Regulation. Such compliance cases may be initiated as a result of non-compliances found as part of the proactive HPRA and HSE annual sampling plan or on a reactive basis. As part of compliance case work, non-compliances with the Cosmetics Regulation are notified to the cosmetic product operators. Non-compliances that are found vary; however, these can often involve a non-compliance with the labelling requirements of Article 19 of that Regulation. The market action, if any, that is carried out is dependent on the perceived risk to consumers in Ireland of the non-compliance(s). This may involve discontinuation of further sales of non-compliant product, or recall from the market place. In other instances, corrective actions proposed by the company may be considered acceptable, for example, labelling changes for future batches to be placed on the Irish market.The HPRA initiated 70 vigilance cases in the years 2017 to 2020, following receipt of reports of suspected undesirable or serious undesirable effects following the use of a cosmetic product. Of these vigilance cases, two products were discontinued from sale and one product was recalled from end-users. </p><p>Between 2017 and 2020, the HPRA notified 33 cosmetic products to the European Commission for notification to other member states and publication online on the Safety Gate website (the EU rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products), previously called RAPEX. Cosmetic products considered to present a serious risk are notified in this manner when it is known the product of concern is available on the market of another member state. This is in line with the European Cosmetic Regulation and Directive 2001/95/EC (the General Product Safety Directive).</p><p>Article 8 of the Cosmetic Regulation establishes ISO 22716, or equivalent, as the requirements for Good Manufacturing Practice in the manufacture of cosmetic products, and it is the obligation of the RP to ensure this is met. Article 7 lists the obligations of cosmetic product distributors. Inspection of manufacturers and distributors is not mandatory for products to be placed on the market; rather, it is carried out using a risk-based approach.</p><p>The number of inspections of cosmetic product distributors and manufacturers located in Ireland from 2017 to 2020 is outlined below. The inspection programme for cosmetic product manufacturers and distributors in 2020 and 2021 has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and onsite inspection is suspended at present.

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p>  <p>  Under this roadmap, it is envisaged that gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres will reopen from the 7 June for individual training. I recognise the significant impact that the public health restrictions have had across many sectors, including the fitness sector, and I hope the Government&rsquo;s announcement last week will provide the sector with a pathway towards reopening.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, the approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered fully vaccinated. </p>  <p>  Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or at the address specified in their passenger locator form.</p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  Further information can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.</p></reply>

This Government&rsquo;s priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including Scoliosis.</p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021.  </p><p>It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.</p><p>Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, a decrease in activity of 16% compared with 2019. By the end of March 2021, CHI had carried out a total of 108 scoliosis surgeries, an increase of 24 surgeries (29%) compared to the same period in 2020.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised my Department that as of the end of March 2021, there were 119 patients on the spinal fusion waiting list, a decrease of 4 patients compared to the start of the year. There were 70 patients on the waiting list for other spinal procedures, which is a decrease of 8 patients since the start of 2021.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that they are working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh to expand orthopaedic capacity. This is expected to have a positive impact on orthopaedic long waiting patients, including reductions in waiting times for children with scoliosis. CHI is also running additional orthopaedic clinics in City West, using a new active clinical triage model, which is reducing the number of children waiting the longest for appointments.</p><p>Representatives of CHI, the Orthopaedic Spinal Team and the Advocacy Groups continue to meet as part of the Co-Design framework on a quarterly basis to work on providing solutions for patients in the spinal service.</p><p>In relation to the number of children who are waiting for an appointment for an initial referral with a scoliosis consultant/scoliosis assessment, the table attached shows the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) published figures by time-band for paediatric orthopaedics outpatients at the end of March 2021. The waiting list figures relate to the specialty of paediatric orthopaedics and cannot be broken down by medical diagnosis, therefore the number of children with a diagnosis of scoliosis who are on this waiting list cannot be provided.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p><p>The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on gov.ie/quarantine. </p><p>An exemption from mandatory quarantine on medical grounds is possible only where a person is travelling to Ireland for an unavoidable, imperative and time sensitive medical reason, which is certified by a registered medical practitioner. </p><p>  Medical services are available at all times in designated facilities, to ensure the health and wellbeing of every person in quarantine. If a person has medical emergency while in quarantine, it is also possible to be transferred to a hospital for treatment. </p><p>There is also a possibility for a person in quarantine to apply for review of their quarantine on medical grounds. One of the permissible grounds for appeal is &lsquo;for medical or other exceptional reasons, including the necessity of providing care for any vulnerable person&rsquo;.</p><p>Requests for review are submitted to the State Liaison Officer present in each designated facility and are considered by independent appeals officers. Decisions on requests for review are provided within a 24-hour period.</p><p>The Government continues to evaluate wider policy on international travel as informed by the epidemiological situation and public health advice, including the possibility of future exemptions. Public health will remain a paramount consideration.</p><p>As of 17th April, passengers who are 'fully vaccinated' and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. </p><p>Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered 'fully vaccinated'.</p><p>Passengers who are 'fully vaccinated' and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p><p>Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers.

This is true right throughout the EU and it is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site(s).</p><p>Licensing issues have occurred because of the change in the number of files screened in for Appropriate Assessment in Ireland. The most important change that led to a much higher number of files being screened in was compliance with European Court of Justice and National case law that determined that it is not appropriate, at the Appropriate Assessment screening stage, to take account of the measures, intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the project on a European site. The impact on this on other European Countries will depend on the geographic spread of their forests and their European sites and the level of compliance in these countries with European law.</p><p>It is up to each regulatory body in each Member State to determine how it carries out screening for Appropriate Assessment but, in doing so, must ensure that any project that can affect any European site &ndash; regardless of separation distance &ndash; requires an Appropriate Assessment to be carried out.</p><p>A likely zone of impact is used in order to identify those European Sites to be specifically addressed during screening. In making a decision regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically-connected European Sites. For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km. This was one of the reasons why 3km was not deemed appropriate.</p></reply>

To that end, it is important that investigative staff who require any records for the purpose of giving evidence in Court should ensure they identify and request the records in question well in advance of the court date.</p>  <p>  While no investigative staff have had access to records restricted in 2021, some staff who might be required to give evidence in court but have moved to new work areas, would have had access to the files of their former work area restricted, as is consistent with best practice in data management and in accordance with GDPR Regulations. In these cases, it is expected that investigators should liaise with the relevant Division to ensure that they are fully prepared for court.

At each level the controls are different.</p><p>The fundamental objective of controlling <i>Salmonella</i>at all stages of the food chain is to safeguard public health by protecting consumers from disease.</p></reply>

The Act puts clear obligations on owners to look after animals under their care.</p>  <p>  Neglect of, or causing unnecessary suffering to, animals is not acceptable and the Department enforces the law as do An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and authorised officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  Reports are followed up by Veterinary Staff in the Regional Veterinary Offices or, in some cases, are referred to the ISPCA or DSPCA for attention by their authorised officers. My Department keeps structures and policies under constant review to ensure </p>  <p>  Whilst not specifically related to animal welfare, the Control of Horses Act 1996 was introduced to provide for the control of horses and to make provision for the licensing of horses in urban and other areas where horses cause a danger or nuisance to people or property. Operation of the Act comes under the remit of Local Authorities. The Department provides financial assistance to the authorities for implementation of the Act and for the development of Urban Horse Projects, including provisions of new structures and education projects, with the aim of encouraging young people in the care and welfare of horses.</p>  <p>  The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within the Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced. The aims of the replacement legislation is to simplify and clarify procedures in the Act in terms of seizure and disposal of horses. A further element is to re-examine the requirement to have a horse license, the objective of which may have been superseded by the Identification of Equidae Regulations (S.I. no 62 of 2016). </p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/262, which came into effect on 1st January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae. This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland by the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. No 62 of 2016). This sets down the rules regarding the identification of equines for owners/keepers of equines who are responsible for their identification.  </p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers throughout the Department's Regional Office network and at slaughter plants. These officers work closely with their veterinary colleagues in the Local Authorities and liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners officials as required. Authorised officers from the Department also carry out checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as export points including ports and airports. </p>  <p>  Work is underway within my Department to undertake a national equine census by the end of this year. This will establish the number of equines in the country and the residences at which they habitually reside. Further development of a central database to provide for the easy updating of equine residence data is also planned for 2021.   </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has initiated and supports a number of other measures to help to improve the equine welfare situation, particularly with a view to developing longer term, sustainable solutions to problems.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide for additional urban horse welfare programmes.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) is responsible for the Control of  Dogs Act and dog licencing. The Control of Dogs Act is the primary legislation that provides for the licensing and control of dogs and for the protection of livestock from worrying by dogs. That Department carried out a consultation on the Control of Dogs issue in 2019. My Department&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Division is following up to evaluate its findings.</p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for the Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015. Under the Regulation, all dogs over 12 weeks of age (or younger if sold before reaching 12 weeks old), must be microchipped, and it is illegal to sell/supply a dog that is not microchipped and the microchip number registered. This helps to ensure the security of a pet that strays and improves the chance of safe return if a dog is stolen. </p>  <p>  As specified in the Regulation, the four database operators must provide details of the chips they hold to Europetnet, an umbrella group of national and local associations based across Europe which register owner information about pets that have been uniquely identified.  This directs authorised persons who have scanned a dog to the appropriate database to identify the dog owner and facilitates a coordinated national approach to microchip identification. Officials in my Department are currently working with stakeholders in reviewing the existing legislation with a view to further enhancing it&rsquo;s effectiveness. </p>  <p>  My Department has introduced SI 681 of 2019 which requires anyone selling or supplying pets to keep records, including a record of from whom the pet was obtained and to whom the pet was sold or supplied. These Regulations also prohibit the advertisement of a dog for sale or supply without providing minimum information about the seller, origin and age of the dog and microchip number. This applies to all forms of advertising. My Department has further work to do on the enforcement of the Regulations and is fully committed to continued efforts on this. </p>  <p>  Animal welfare is high on the agenda of my Department and considerable resources and funding are provided to address the issue. In December 2020, I announced the provision of record funding of &euro;3.2 million to 101 animal welfare organisations throughout the country, many of which work with equines and canines. The Programme for Government contains an undertaking to make additional funding available to animal welfare charities and urban horse welfare programmes over the coming years, to which I am fully committed.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements the National Waste Prevention Programme, which includes food waste. My Department is involved in particular in relation to food waste and loss inside the farm gate, and works closely with both the DECC and the EPA in this regard.</p><p>The existing workstreams in the Department and its agencies with regard to reducing food waste, include the following:  </p><p>Funding supports for initiatives to promote the reduction of food waste generated by food businesses, retailer/wholesalers or suppliers in rural areas is provided under the Department&rsquo;s Rural Innovation and Development Fund. The closing date for applications this year was 10th April, and it is anticipated that contracts will be awarded in the coming weeks. </p><p>In relation to fisheries, the discards ban or Landing Obligation is a key element of the Common Fisheries Policy, which was phased in over a number of years and has been fully implemented since 2019. This policy requires that catches of fish must be landed and may not be discarded at sea. This former practice of discarding at sea was regarded as wasteful as the fish discarded were already dead.  </p><p>In relation to the Bioeconomy, my Department co-chairs the high-level Bioeconomy Implementation Group, along with  DECC. One of its key actions is to examine ways of turning biowaste, nutrients, food processing residues and discards into valuable resources, by establishing the conditions required for their commercial development and viability. Using the bio-economy approach, unavoidable waste can be recycled and valorised.  Bioeconomy funding opportunities are provided through the relevant national research funders including my Department.</p><p>Support for research into food shelf life and related issues is provided to food businesses through the Prepared Consumer Food Centre at Teagasc, Ashtown, which is funded by my Department.</p><p>There are also initiatives by Bord Bia  under the Origin Green programme, which encourage food businesses to set targets to reduce food waste.</p></reply>

This programme is providing some &euro;29 million in funding to support 18 library projects, including the provision of a mobile library vehicle for Kerry County Council, and the My Open Library initiative, over the period 2016 to end-2022. In addition, in 2020, my Department provided capital funding of &euro;3million to support refurbishment projects in public libraries and Kerry County Council were successful in obtaining funding of &euro;100,000 towards the cost of upgrade and refurbishment works in all nine of their library buildings. Should similar funding become available again in the future, any proposals for funding received from Kerry County Council would be assessed on their merits. However, I would like to emphasise that it is public library service policy to ensure that library spaces are as flexible as possible to ensure maximum utilisation for all library members. </p>  <p>  I commend the Storied Kerry initiative and recognise the importance of preserving our history and culture for generations to come.

In total, the 25 successful projects under this call will receive funding of &euro;81 million from the Fund and provide total investment in rural areas of just under &euro;100 million.

Earlier this year, I announced details of 226 projects to the value of almost &euro;15.8 million that were approved funding under ORIS 2020. This included funding of just over &euro;2 million for 35 projects in the midland counties of Longford, Offaly, Laois and Westmeath.</p>  <p>  Building on the launch of &ldquo;Our Rural Future",  I was pleased to recently announce details of the 2021 Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme with an indicative budget of &euro;14million. This reflects a 20% increase in funding from my Department for the scheme in 2021 and includes a funding contribution from F&aacute;ilte Ireland who are partners with my Department in delivering the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open to all counties and funding is allocated based on the merits of the project applications submitted. The counties in the midlands have a wealth of natural resources that can be further developed for outdoor recreation purposes and I hope to see a large number of good project applications from that region under the Scheme this year.</p></reply>

The CSP provides an annual co-funding contribution of &euro;19,033 for each fulltime equivalent (FTE) position being supported, and, where warranted, provides &euro;32,000 towards the cost of employing a manager. Qualifying organisations must be social enterprises capable of generating income from their activities in order to meet the full salary costs of the supported posts, for example, from income received from the public use of facilities and services.</p>  <p>  In 2020, Indecon International Economic Consultants were engaged by my Department to carry out an independent review of CSP. The final report was published in late September 2020 and is available on my Department's website. My Department and Pobal have now commenced work on the restructuring of the Programme. </p>  <p>  Pending the transition to the new restructured Programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the Expression Of Interest process. However, it is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery later in 2021.  </p>  <p>  As a first step in that regard, on 28 April, my Department, in collaboration with the Department for Transport, launched a three-year pilot initiative for the provision of high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes for those on low incomes and/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged. Funding of &euro;3m is being provided by the Department of Transport for this initiative over a three-year period and will be made available through my Department's Community Services Programme.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the pilot will support up to 6 social enterprises in 2021. Organisations eligible to apply are those currently supported under the Community Services Programme or, alternatively, are in a Partnership/Consortium of which at least one member is currently a CSP supported organisation. The closing date for receipt of applications is noon on 28 May.</p></reply>
