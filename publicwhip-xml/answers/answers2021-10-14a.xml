In addition, &euro;13.18 million of unspent capital funding has been carried forward from 2020 giving a total capital allocation of &euro;181.8 million for 2021.</p><p>As of 11<sup>th</sup>October 2021 the total capital spend amounted to &euro;69 million. I am providing the Deputy with a breakdown of the allocations and spend with my reply.</p><p>The public health restrictions that were imposed earlier in the year across all sectors of society, including the construction industry, have meant unavoidable delays to capital project delivery.</p><p>Given these challenges, capital expenditure has been kept under constant review during the year so that the resources provided are put to best use. In this regard, funding of &euro;10.5m was reallocated to the Local Improvement Scheme in July to double the amount funding for the scheme in 2021. This funding will be fully utilised by the Local Authorities by the end of the year.</p><p>My officials are working closely with local authorities to maximise spend across our capital schemes, and drawdown will ramp up over the coming weeks. I also expect to avail of a deferred surrender so that projects which are delayed can be funded next year. I will continue to monitor spend closely, and will ensure that our resources are put to best use for rural areas and communities.<b></b></p><p>Table 1: 2021 REV Capital Allocation and expenditure as at 11<sup>th</sup>October 2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2021 REV Capital Allocation</th>       <th>Spend as at 11/10/21</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>V42 -   RURAL &amp;amp; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (GROSS)</td>       <td>168.310</td>       <td>68.994</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A -   RURAL DEVELOPMENT, REGIONAL AFFAIRS &amp;amp; ISLANDS</td>       <td>150.764</td>       <td>61.890</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.4 -   RURAL SUPPORTS</td>       <td>16.000</td>       <td>1.758</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.5 -   LEADER</td>       <td>44.000</td>       <td>41.465</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.6 -   REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</td>       <td>1.120</td>       <td>0.593</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.7 -   RURAL REGENERATION AND DEVELOPMENT</td>       <td>87.000</td>       <td>17.918</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.8 -   ISLANDS</td>       <td>2.644</td>       <td>0.156</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B -   COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</td>       <td>17.546</td>       <td>7.104</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.6 -   SUPPORTS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES</td>       <td>1.267</td>       <td>1.267</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.7 - DORMANT   ACCOUNTS MEASURES</td>       <td>2.500</td>       <td>0.260</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.8 -   PROGRAMME FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION</td>       <td>2.650</td>       <td>0.000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.10 -   LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND ARCHIVE SERVICE</td>       <td>6.629</td>       <td>1.077</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.11 &ndash;   COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMME</td>       <td>4.500</td>       <td>4.500</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.  Cork County Council has secured over &euro;6 million in funding since the Scheme was re-established in 2017. </p>  <p>  I launched the 2021 Scheme in May with funding of &euro;10.5 million. The allocation to each Local Authority was based on the physical area of each county.  Cork, as the largest county, was allocated &euro;920,000. This was the maximum level of funding available to any individual county.</p>  <p>  In July, I was pleased to be able to allocate an additional &euro;10.5m under the Scheme, bringing the total level of funding to &euro;21 million this year. This funding was made available on the understanding  that it would be fully utilised by each Local Authority before the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  My officials engaged directly with each local authority, including Cork County Council, to establish the number of road projects they could complete by year-end and the associated level of funding required to deliver these before the end of the year. Each Local Authority received 70% of what they indicated they had the capacity to deliver before the end of the year.  On this basis, Cork County Council secured some &euro;493,000 under this second tranche, bringing their total funding in 2021 to over &euro;1.4 million.  </p>  <p>  The approach to allocating funding to each County in 2022, including County Cork, will be reviewed in advance of the launch of the scheme next year.</p></reply>

In addition, in April 2021 I announced details of an additional &euro;50 million  to cover the period 2021-2022.  This funding is designed to support the continued implementation of LEADER period in the transition period leading up to the introduction of the new Common Agricultural Policy from 2023.</p>  <p>  Of the total allocation of &euro;70 million, &euro;65 was allocated to the Local Action Groups (LAGs) to cover both core project expenditure and their administration and animation costs. A further &euro;3 million of the funding was allocated to support co-operation projects between LAGs, with &euro;2 million being allocated to provide preparatory support for the next LEADER programme.  Funding opportunities under the LEADER Food Initiative also remain in place until the entirety of funds are exhausted.</p>  <p>  All the payment claims for 2021 projects have not yet been submitted in respect of Laois and Offaly.  However, I can confirm that the amount allocated to Co. Laois for the transitional period  is &euro;2.1 million and to Co. Offaly is &euro;2.3 million.  It is open to each LAG to manage this funding over the two year transitional period.   </p>  <p>  I am confident that this level of funding will be sufficient to continue operation of the LEADER Programme in both LAG areas until the commencement of the new LEADER Programme.</p></reply>

Under this year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs were eligible to apply for funding. Projects that repurpose existing community or publicly owned buildings in town or village centres to facilitate remote working were also eligible.</p><p>I also recently announced the awarding of &euro;8.8 million in funding through the Connected Hubs  stream to add capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and Broadband Connection Points across Ireland. </p><p>I am happy to confirm that I have secured additional funding as part of Budget 2022 across the range of services provided by my Department, including for the further support of remote working hubs.  As my Department continues to implement supports for hubs under the 2022 suite of schemes, options for funding the repurposing of existing space held by rural SMEs can be examined as part of the scheme design process.  </p></reply>

Progress with the model simulation was somewhat delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions however the NMCI were able to host a small group of islanders, ferry operators and officials at their facility in Ringaskiddy in July for a demonstration of the initial iteration of the marine simulation.   </p>  <p>  I understand from Department officials who viewed the simulation that it presents vessel operators with an extremely realistic experience of sea conditions and that it is expected to greatly assist in identifying development options for the pier.</p>  <p>  Following feedback from the various parties who attended the demonstration, the NMCI are furthering the development of the simulation and there will be a further, more extensive demonstration held upon completion.    I understand that the local authority have recently received feedback from the NMCI as regards the updated simulation which will be discussed with my Department officials in the coming days.  Following this, further steps will be taken to progress this project.</p></reply>

Property owners are being part funded to improve the facades of buildings, carry out artwork, and install features such as canopies and street furniture. </p><p>The initiative is being delivered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department, with considerable discretion provided to each Local Authority to design the scheme locally to meet their individual needs.</p><p>As the funding is being made available from savings elsewhere in my Department, Local Authorities had been advised that the projects must be completed and funding drawn down from my Department by mid-November. In practice, this has meant that many property owners are being asked to complete works before the end of this month in order for Local Authorities to meet this deadline. </p><p>Given the challenge this is presenting for some property owners, I am pleased to note that the deadline for the completion of works has been extended until 31st December 2021. In addition, more flexibility is being provided to each Local Authority to manage the completion of works locally and to subsequently report on the delivery of the scheme to my Department. </p><p>There has been a very positive response to this new initiative and I have no doubt that this funding will make a big impact on the appearance of our towns and villages. Any decision in respect of a further round of funding for streetscapes will be considered alongside other town and village investment priorities next year. </p></reply>

The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of new digital hubs.  In April, I announced funding of &euro;81m for 25 landmark projects under the RRDF. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs. Support for new remote working hubs is also one of the areas being prioritised under my Department's &euro;15m 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme. The focus is on establishing new remote working facilities in town and village centres where properties are currently vacant or where existing community/ publicly owned buildings can be repurposed. This call closed to applications on 16 July 2021 and the assessment process is currently underway, with successful projects set to be announced by the end of the year.  </p><p>In May I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. This platform will offer a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. The National Hub Network Working Group initially identified and mapped over 400 remote working hubs. To date, approximately 146 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs Network and been on boarded onto the platform, with this number rising on an ongoing basis. </p><p>A significant number of initiatives will be developed through the Network including: supporting collective engagement between Connected Hubs and large scale employers; supporting collective engagement between Connected Hubs and Government agencies; and helping to identify the benefits Connected Hubs deliver for their local communities and the wider economy. </p><p>In July this year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded &euro;8.8 million in funding to over 100 successful applicants.  This funding supports the addition of capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and broadband connection points throughout the country.</p><p>I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery.</p></reply>

The application processes are reviewed before each call for applications to ensure they are user friendly and fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the criteria for the CL&Aacute;R Programme, my Department initiated a process whereby local authorities further assist communities by verifying information for applicants and ensuring that all required permissions, match-funding, etc., are in place so applications fulfil all scheme requirements. </p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme is also the result of a review of the Communities Facilities Scheme and RAPID programme and provides a more flexible, and targeted approach to providing small scale infrastructure funding to enhance facilities in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  My Department offers information sessions and workshops for communities and groups on its funding programmes and schemes. This helps applicants understand the schemes, criteria which apply and with completing the application process. </p>  <p>  The LEADER programme, under the remit of my Department, is delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 sub-regional areas. I am committed to making the application process for LEADER as efficient as possible for all applicants. </p>  <p>  My Department engages regularly with the Local Action Groups (LAGs) delivering LEADER to identify potential areas for programme improvement. Following a forum with the LAGs, I have implemented a series of 31 improvements to streamline the LEADER programme. I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of LEADER to ensure the process is as streamlined as possible while being mindful of the governing EU Regulations. </p>  <p>  I believe these efforts will see administrative barriers reduced in order that our funding has the broadest possible reach and that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is committed to keeping under review the administration of all our funding programmes and schemes to ensure they remain fit for purpose, targeted, can be accessed by those who need the supports most and are delivering benefits for communities across the country. I welcome feedback on our programmes and schemes from communities so we can continue to do this. </p></reply>

They are publicly accessible sites that serve areas without reliable high-speed broadband, including isolated communities in rural areas and on many of our offshore islands. Sites are provided with a high-speed broadband connection which they make available for onsite community use, including remote work and study.</p><p>The Nationwide BCP Network will include approximately 300 sites. To date, 214 BCPs have been completed and are open and serving their local communities. Of these, 16 are in Cork County, with a further 8 planned. Cork City has donated its allowance of 12 BCPs to the County and, as such, there are no BCPs planned for the North Central area of the city at this time. Cork County has the highest number of BCPs of any local authority area.</p><p>It is estimated that the current build phase of the BCP network will be achieved in the next 3 months. However, it should be noted that global component shortages may impact the delivery of some sites.  </p><p>Once this phase of the BCP project has completed, my department will begin to scale up the numerous development activities that it has recently begun trialling. These pilot projects include supports for remote workers and students, a suite of digital skills training courses, arts and culture activities including musical instruction and access to national cultural resources, and a range of eHealth and telemedicine programmes.</p><p>I have made available funding of &euro;10,000 per participating local authority to support BCP development activities. This is in addition to significant awards made to BCPs for capital works and equipment purchases under the recent &euro;8.8M Connected Hubs Call. </p><p>The locations of planned and completed BCPs may be found at <i>myconnectedcommunity.ie/</i>.</p></reply>

A key part of achieving this mission is ensuring that those most in need are able to access services and supports and that we deliver outcomes that positively impact the quality of life of those living and working in our communities. This has been of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, where ongoing communication has assisted us in identifying supports or funding needs and the most appropriate remedial or proactive measures that can be taken in response.</p><p>One example of proactive interaction with communities was the delivery in 2019, in conjunction with Pobal, of a series of 'Helping Hands' events nationwide, to engage with communities and create awareness and understanding of our funding programmes. Feedback from these interactions was very positive, and it is hoped that similar events can be scheduled again the future based on the public health advice going forward.  </p><p>My Department has also commissioned Pobal to commence work on a scoping exercise for a centralised grantee database which could be a useful mechanism to increase visibility of funding being provided across Government.</p><p>In respect of wider entitlements or supports available to individuals in rural communities across other Government Departments, the Citizens Information Service plays an important role in providing free advisory and information services to citizens, while information on individual schemes is also available on the <i>www.gov.ie</i>portal.</p></reply>

In delivering on that Mission my Department has a range of policies and programme interventions delivered throughout the country. In relation specifically to public greenspace, public parks and playgrounds, the following supports are relevant:</p><p>The <b>Community Enhancement Programme</b>in my Department provides small grants to community groups to enhance facilities, including playgrounds, in disadvantaged areas. Funding is allocated by my Department to each Local Authority area, and the Local Community Development Committee, with support from their Local Authority, administers the funding in that area. There is total funding of &euro;4.5m in 2021, with &euro;156,299 allocated to the Cork County Council area.</p><p>The <b>CL&Aacute;R </b>programme provides funding for small scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population over a defined period.  Measure 2 of the 2021 CL&Aacute;R Programme which supports Outdoor Community Recreation Facilities provides support for the enhancement of existing and/or the development of new accessible outdoor community recreation facilities including playgrounds, skateboard parks and Multi Use Games Areas (MUGAs). The closing date for receipt of applications has now passed. The assessment of the applications received is ongoing and I expect to make an announcement on the approved projects in the coming weeks.</p><p>Funding for the type of project referred to by the Deputy may be available through the <b>LEADER</b>Transitional Programme. </p><p>In line with the Government&rsquo;s ambitious policy for the development of rural Ireland, <i>Our Rural Future</i>, which was launched earlier this year, I announced an increased allocation of &euro;70 million for the Transitional LEADER programme, which is now EU co-financed. This funding will support locally-led projects which focus on many of the key themes of <i>Our Rural Future</i>such as building capacity and empowering local communities, embracing opportunities in the green economy, supporting remote working and the digital transformation, developing our outdoor amenities and creating jobs in rural areas</p><p>This programme, which will cover the period 2021-2022, came into effect on the 1<sup></sup>April 2021 for new project applications.  The programme will be delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country. </p><p>Funding is provided under a broad range of themes, including enterprise development and social inclusion.  </p><p>The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the LAG which administers the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partner to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all LAGs, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on my Department's website at the following link:<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups.</i></p></reply>

Over the course of the 2016-2019 work programme, the Taskforce delivered more than 70 targeted actions. Among these were the addition of more than 1,000km of ducting along our national roads, the introduction of ComReg&rsquo;s outdoor mobile coverage map and a range of consumer protection and advice measures.</p>  <p>  The last formal meeting of the Taskforce was the 2019 Annual Stakeholder Forum, 11 October 2019. In the interim, I and my officials have continued to engage closely with all Taskforce members and interested stakeholders to ensure that the good work of the Taskforce continues and is built upon, for example via the continued operation of the Joint Utilities Local Authority User Forum which is the primary means of addressing issues between local authorities, utilities and industry. The lines of communication between former Taskforce members remain open and productive and good progress has been made on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is my preference that the Taskforce would reconvene at the earliest possible opportunity. Given the scope of opportunity presented by several recent developments, including the publication of Our Rural Future, it is now the right time to formally re-establish the Taskforce and progress those issues that will have most impact.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications are thus currently finalising proposals to guide the future direction and work programme of the Taskforce and engagement with industry has also commenced in this regard.</p></reply>

However, since it was relaunched in 2016, the programme provides funding, in its own right, for small scale projects. </p><p>The Measures funded through this year's programme are:  </p><p>- Measure 1 which supports School and Community Safety projects </p><p>- Measure 2 which supports Outdoor Community Recreation Facilities; and, </p><p>- Measure 3 which funds Community Wellbeing Supports. This includes funding for Community Gardens and Allotments and funding for Mobility and Cancer Care Transport vehicles. </p><p>In addition, this year Minister Humphreys introduced a new CL&Aacute;R Innovation Measure. This funding is targeted at piloting new ideas which address specific challenges faced by communities in CL&Aacute;R areas, including rural isolation, population change, social disadvantage and marginalisation.</p><p>The Measures to be funded next year will be reviewed in advance of the launch of the 2022 Programme. There are currently no plans to reintroduce a top-up grant for other programmes such as the Sports Capital Programme. </p><p>The RAPID programme, which was launched in 2001, closed to new applications in 2011. A recast RAPID Programme was rolled out in 2017 using the Local Community Development Committees which are well placed to identify and address local disadvantage.  This new approach also took into account the findings of a Value for Money Policy Review of RAPID in 2011 which recommended that any follow-on programmes should not be rolled out in the same way as the original programme. </p><p>In 2018, the Department reviewed the recast RAPID and the Communities Facilities Scheme.  Following that review it was decided to launch a new Community Enhancement Programme which builds on and replaces the Communities Facilities Scheme and the RAPID programme. The Community Enhancement Programme is available in all areas, not only the areas previously identified as RAPID areas.  </p></reply>

Their core objective is to achieve a social, societal, or environmental impact, and like other businesses, they pursue their objectives by trading in goods and services on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Surpluses generated by social enterprises are re-invested into achieving their core social objectives, and they contribute to a fair and inclusive sustainable recovery.</p>  <p>  For Social Enterprise to fully realise its potential in Ireland, it is necessary to build more coherence and raise awareness with the public, amongst social enterprises and other businesses, and across the civil and public service.  Accordingly, developing and promoting a wide understanding of social enterprise is a key priority of the National Social Enterprise Policy, and the success of the Policy in a large part depends on the success in communicating the message about what Social Enterprises are. </p>  <p>  To this end, I recently opened the 2021 Awareness Raising Initiative for Social Enterprise, or ARISE scheme.  The scheme has two strands, one for social enterprises and a second for social enterprise support or network organisations, and will provide funding for awareness raising initiatives to increase awareness of social enterprises and their potential.</p>  <p>  To date, five applications have been received.  It is important to note that the scheme is open for applications until 20th October, and that the ongoing engagement between my officials and relevant stakeholders indicates a good level of interest in the scheme.</p></reply>

Further Progress Reports will follow every six months for the duration of the Policy.</p>  <p>  While work on compiling the first Progress Report is ongoing, I am delighted with the level of activity across Departments in recent months to deliver on the Policy&rsquo;s ambition.  This has seen investment provided for rural communities in local transport and active travel, remote working facilities and digital connectivity, and huge levels of support for important projects under the my Department&rsquo;s Rural Development Investment Programme.</p>  <p>  We have also seen, for example, the launch of the agri-food strategy Food Vision 2030 and the Pathways to Work 2021-2025 Strategy, the publication of the Maritime Area Planning Bill and launch of the National Marine Planning Framework, and the formal establishment of Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest at the start of this month. The revised National Development Plan, published last week, also significantly reinforces the objectives of Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  I look forward to providing full detail on progress in relation to the 2021 Work Programme when the first Our Rural Future Progress Report is published later this year.</p></reply>

This reflects the important contribution which the scheme makes to connectivity in rural Ireland. The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities and represents a vital piece of infrastructure for rural communities.</p><p>The scheme has been funded by my Department since 2017 and is administered by Local Authorities. Prior to 2017, the scheme was not funded for a number of years.</p><p>I launched the 2021 Scheme on 14th May with a budget of &euro;10.5 million. I was very pleased to source additional funding for the Scheme during the year and to allocate a further round of funding on 29th July to bring the total level of funding to &euro;21 million this year. </p><p>I was pleased to be in a position to again announce an increase in the funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million as part of Budget 2022. In addition, I have continued to actively engage with my colleague, Minister Ryan, to explore the potential for further financial support for LIS from his Department,  While I accept that his Department's priority at the moment remains the upkeep and maintenance of national and local public roads, I believe a cross- Government approach might reap dividends in tackling the backlog of applications on hand in local authorities.</p><p>I have set out in the table below the allocations to individual authorities under the 2021 Scheme. Payment by my Department under the Scheme normally occurs in Quarter 4 of each year when the works are fully completed by the Local Authorities, and I would expect the 2021 payments by my Department to the Local Authorities to commence in the coming weeks. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">County                                                                                                              LIS  2021 Allocation</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>&euro;463,931</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>&euro;1,119,389</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>&euro;828,528</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>&euro;1,412,738</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>&euro;1,188,403</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>&euro;1,580,871</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>&euro;1,187,099</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>&euro;495,586</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>&euro;778,682</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>&euro;554,259</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>&euro;503,830</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>&euro;1,504,659</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>&euro;393,041</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>&euro;417,821</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>&euro;1,361,625</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>&euro;803,937</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>&euro;1,326,223</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>&euro;545,240</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>&euro;445,495</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>&euro;470,542</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>&euro;721,531</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>&euro;872,759</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>&euro;628,389</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>&euro;653,786</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>&euro;741,635</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  On 29 September, I announced the 'approval in principle' of 31 new trails to join the Walks Scheme. This fulfils the commitment in the Programme for Government and Our Rural Future to double the number of trails on the Scheme to 80 trails. These trails will be formally brought into the scheme by Local Development Companies who deliver the Walks Scheme locally and who will develop work plans for each of the individual landholders involved. </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this expansion, and in keeping with recommendations from the recently published review of the Walks Scheme, I have committed to funding 8 new Rural Recreation Officer (RROs) posts in Local Development Companies. This is in addition to the 13 posts already in place. I have also committed to providing additional administration funding for the Local Development Companies to support them in delivering the scheme locally.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that there will be new RROs facilitating the delivery of trails in Kerry, Louth, Waterford, Limerick, Cavan and surrounding areas, and the Islands. Funding for an additional RRO post is also being provided to the local Development Company in West Cork given the large number of existing participants on the scheme there and for a new RRO post for the remainder of County Cork. </p>  <p>  The above locations have been selected on the basis that they are areas which have, or will have under the recent announcement, walking trails on the Scheme. Depending on the number of trails in a given area, some Local Development Companies will be encouraged to work collaboratively so that one RRO can cover a whole county or a number of counties, depending on the particular situation locally. The funding for these positions will ultimately be determined by the development of an acceptable business case by the companies concerned. My Department has been engaging with the relevant Local Development Companies in this regard. </p>  <p>  I am also committed to examining further increases in the number of RROs nationwide based on the outcome of our new National Outdoor Recreation Strategy, which is currently being developed in conjunction with Comhairle na Tuaithe.</p></reply>

It  has met on  four occasions  since its inaugural meeting in November last year.   </p>  <p>  In parallel with the IDG, a Town Centre First Advisory Group was also established to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to support the work of the IDG. It  is chaired by my colleague, Mr. Peter Burke T.D., Minister of State for Planning and Local Government. It is comprised of individual representatives from a broad range of sectors to ensure effective and diverse representation with the capacity and experience to contribute in a meaningful way to the preparation and implementation of a practical TCF approach.</p>  <p>  There is general agreement within the groups that there is no one solution or issue that can or should be addressed in isolation but rather that that TCF should take a holistic approach and be capable of being tailored to address towns of varying size and characteristics. </p>  <p>  I understand that a report on the implementation of a Town Centre First approach, together with recommendations on how to proceed, is nearing completion.

It is too early to review its application, though I am open to doing so at a later stage. </p>  <p>  Employers, employees, and their representative bodies find Codes of Practice particularly useful as reference points and they often serve as the basis for internal policies and procedures within firms and across sectors. While failure to follow a Code prepared under section 20(1)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 is not an offence in itself, section 20(9) provides that in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court or the WRC, a Code of Practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the Code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be considered in determining that question. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect my Department and the agencies under its remit are driving the implementation of actions under the National Remote Work Strategy. Each action in the Strategy has been attributed to lead actors across government for delivery and each action is scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year.</p></reply>

The issue of the classification or reclassification of electricity generation facilities arises in various contexts, and, as such, there are a number of possibilities that could be the focus of the deputy&rsquo;s question. </p>  <p>  The classification referred to by the Deputy may refer to the regulatory licensing regime. Under section 14(1) of the Electricity Regulation Act, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has the sole statutory function to issue licences to, inter alia, any person to generate electricity or to carry out other electricity market functions, such as discharging the functions of grid operation.  The CRU is the independent regulator in Ireland, and is accountable to the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. </p>  <p>  The subject matter of the Deputy's question may draw from separate provisions in the 2019 Electricity Directive which requires that neither transmission nor distribution system operators own energy storage facilities. The CRU, as the independent regulator, carried out a review of these requirements in 2020. Through this regulatory exercise, it was confirmed that both ESBN and EirGrid meet these requirements, specifically that they do not own such storage facilities, and that there is therefore no further work needed with regards to these provisions. </p>  <p>  I have no role in respect of the licencing matters referenced above.  I am not aware of any engagement by my Department with the European Commission on reclassifying facilities such as pumped hydropower storage systems as grid infrastructure for the purposes of the grid operator, as set out by the Deputy.   </p></reply>

This extension was granted to mitigate the anticipated backlog due to the temporary closure of test centres under Covid restrictions at the time.</p>  <p>  Whether or not a vehicle will be given a two-year test certificate or a one-year test certificate has not been affected by the application of the extension.

It applies where both a specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 is satisfied, namely, that the expenses are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment by the employee concerned.  A further requirement is that such expenses are not reimbursed by an employee&rsquo;s employer. </p>  <p>  The FRE regime was established to apply a uniformity of approach to tax deductibility for expenses of large groups of employees and to facilitate ease of administration for both Revenue and employees. The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. </p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it received a submission from the body that represents Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in 2018. I am further advised that Revenue requested further information pertaining to the submission however, to date, this information has not been received.  Should Revenue receive a submission in respect of SNAs, it will be given due consideration.  </p>  <p>  Revenue advises me that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which such expenses are not reimbursed by the employer. </p></reply>

In relation to the issue of persons that availed of pandemic unemployment payments and as a result were placed in a position that they were required to restructure credit arrangements, the Central Bank has advised that it is working to ensure lenders are acting in a way that protects the best interests of borrowers, and in line with relevant codes and regulations.  Through ongoing engagement with lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers who continue to be affected by the economic issues surrounding Covid-19 are supported through this period of unprecedented stress.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has stated that its clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers &ndash; in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and regulations for lenders lending to SMEs &ndash; to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions that are tailored to the needs of the individual borrower and which facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to repaying their debt.   </p>  <p>  Lenders also have an obligation to report credit information to the Central Credit Register (CCR). In relation to the impact of Covid-19 payment breaks on the CCR, the Central Bank made it clear to all lenders that either a full or partial payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 was not, in itself, an event that was reportable to the CCR. Furthermore, it also indicated that a Covid-19 payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 should not have be reported to the CCR as either a &ldquo;missed payment&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;restructure event&rdquo;.  While the general Covid-19 payment break scheme operated by the members of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland in 2020 has ceased, support and assistance, which can include payment breaks, can still be agreed between borrowers and lenders on a case by case basis where necessary and appropriate.  Also, it should be noted that the CCR does not produce credit ratings; rather the information on a credit report provided by the CCR is factual in nature.  Credit reports contain no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers.   Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites.  Borrowers may access their credit report free of charge (subject to fair usage) from the CCR.</p></reply>

Mayo County Council appointed consultants for the scheme in February 2020. The scheme has a preliminary total project budget of &euro;8.2 million. Options are currently being developed for the scheme. On selection of a preferred option, Mayo County Council will submit the scheme to An Bord Pleanala for Planning Consent. Provisionally, it is expected to go for Planning in Autumn 2022. </p><p>The consultants, with support from the Steering Group Members, are making good progress through stage 1. As part of this work, surveys, feeding into the Hydrological and Hydraulic assessments, have been ongoing throughout the year. The Hydrology Report is now complete. The Hydraulics Report will be finalised in the coming weeks, once inputs from the data gathered in the CCTV Survey are complete. The Topographical Survey has been completed. Ground Investigations are currently on site. Environmental Surveys, providing baseline environmental data for the project, are ongoing. These surveys include Habitat, Mammal, Bird, Bat and Invasive Alien Species surveys.</p><p>The Opening Collaborative Workshop was held (virtually) on Wednesday 9<sup>th</sup>June 2021. Representatives from various relevant stakeholders were invited to the workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to identify and discuss any particular issues, constraints and opportunities that could inform the development of the Scheme. The proposed scheme, as developed through the Western CFRAM study and outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plan for the Moy &amp;amp; Killala Bay River Basin (May 2018), was presented alongside other factors, such as: Potential for Natural Water Retention Measures, Objectives of Ballina Local Area Plan, Public Realm/Landscape Enhancements at Cathedral Road and Emmet Street, Ireland&rsquo;s Greenest Town Initiative, and Outcomes of the environmental constraints study including Environmental and Cultural Heritage.</p><p>There will be further public consultation once a preferred scheme has been identified.</p><p>Further information will be provided on the project website, which is available at:</p><p><i>www.floodinfo.ie/frs/en/ballina/home/</i>.</p></reply>

A Scheme Viability Review involves looking again at the options for the community and trying to identify any new information or discrepancies with the CFRAM Study, which may facilitate a more cost-effective scheme, and potentially result in an additional scheme being considered for the area. Regarding the proposed Foxford Flood Relief Scheme, the Office of Public Works is currently undertaking this Scheme Viability Review to determine whether a feasible scheme is possible for Foxford.</p><p>The review is nearing its conclusion and a report is expected with the findings at the end of this year (2021). </p></reply>

A formal response to the submission from Clare County County will issue shortly from my Department.

Arbitrary detention of political dissidents is a key element of the repression, and reports from NGOs now suggest that there are over 800 political prisoners in Belarus.</p>  <p>  This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and Ireland has been highly vocal on the international stage in calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all those unjustly detained.</p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland co-sponsored an &ldquo;Arria formula&rdquo; meeting at the United Nations Security Council, initiated by Estonia, on the situation in Belarus. Ireland, along with other members of the international community, have also used forums such as the Human Rights Council to hold the regime to account.</p>  <p>  At a European level, Ireland has consistently supported economic sanctions on individuals and entities upholding the Lukashenko regime. We are currently engaged in discussions on a fifth package of sanctions.</p>  <p>  The Lukashenko regime continues to display a sense of impunity, and has failed thus far to respond to international pressure. However, Ireland will continue to push for an inclusive dialogue of the entirety of Belarusian society, in order to pave the way towards free and fair elections and a democratic Belarus.</p></reply>

The current roster of approximately 199 volunteers is in place since 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  Participation in election observation missions has been challenging due to COVID-19, with the risk profile of missions enhanced due to transit through international airport hubs, extensive in-country travel and interactions with observers from a significant number of other countries.

As such, since March 2020, Ireland has not nominated election observers for EU or OSCE Election Observation Missions.</p>  <p>  However, given the re-opening of non-essential international travel and the progress of Ireland&rsquo;s vaccination programme, my officials have been working to clarify the safe conditions for volunteer election observers before, during and after their participation in election observation missions.

Budget 2022 allocated the highest ever amount to ODA, over &euro;1 billion, an increase of &euro;140 million on the 2021 figure.  </p>  <p>  However, in years of high GNI growth, large increases in cash allocations achieve only modest increases as a proportion of GNI.  My Department is building systems that enable our development programme to grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable and responsible way. </p>  <p>  In 2020, a total of &euro;867 million was allocated to ODA.  Of that, &euro;545 million was managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs: this include &euro;50 million through the European Development Fund and contributions to EU trust funds.  An additional &euro;178 million was channelled directly through the EU ODA-eligible budget as part of Ireland&rsquo;s annual EU assessed contribution.  The remainder is accounted for by other ODA-spending Departments, including Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Justice. The full breakdown of 2020&rsquo;s ODA is currently being finalised and will be published next month in the Irish Aid Annual Report 2020.</p>  <p>  The allocation to ODA in budget 2021 was &euro;868 million, of which &euro;571 million was to my Department.  The budget day forecast for the EU ODA-eligible was &euro;159 million, a significant portion of the &euro;297 million in ODA managed outside of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This represented an increase, with 2021 the first year of the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework, which created a new single development instrument incorporating the European Development Fund. </p>  <p>  It is likely when final figures are compiled that the 2021 out turn for ODA will be above &euro;900 million, in part due to additional support to the global pandemic response.

The circulars set out the sequence of recruitment for substitute appointments, which include contacting a person on the substitute list established by the employer, or by using a national substitute service such as SubSeeker, or advertising. </p>  <p>  Due to the successful roll out of the vaccination programme and changes to the rules around close contacts and the requirements to restrict movements, teacher absences due to Covid-19 should be reduced this year.  In this context using non-mainstream class teachers should no longer be necessary and schools should revert to using the normal sequence of filling substitute positions. It will therefore no longer be necessary to &lsquo;bank hours&rsquo;.  This will ensure that children with special education needs get access to their specialised teaching on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students are also in place.  However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>Should post-primary services resume operating at 100% capacity and  where additional vehicles that were provided for social distancing purposes are removed, any spare capacity available will be offered on those services to concessionary pupils or late applicants where such capacity exists.  </p></reply>

My Department currently funds Marino Institute of Education via capitation grants and grants in lieu of tuition fees in respect of approved student numbers on its primary ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The funding and governance remit for Marino Institute of Education is due to be moved to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, as part of the process of transferring functions following on from the establishment of that Department. This work requires administrative and legislative solutions to address residual issues, and is in train as of now.</p>  <p>  In addition, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science officials are currently working on the reform of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971. The General Scheme of a Bill was published in May this year and the Pre-Legislative Scrutiny process on the General Scheme was recently completed. It is anticipated that this Bill will be published shortly and initiated through the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 is being reformed to ensure that the higher education sector is enabled to meet the vision for an excellent higher education and research system which is innovative, adaptive and inclusive, which has strong engagement with the wider education system and wider society and which creates knowledge and contributes to social, economic and cultural development. This updated legislation is intended to provide the HEA with the necessary authority in relation to revised functions including planning, funding and oversight of the higher education sector and other related matters which more fully reflect its current central role and responsibilities in relation to higher education.</p>  <p>  The legislation will provide that the HEA will have oversight of the full higher education sector including teaching training colleges. The legislation includes a designation system which provides that all higher education institutions will become designated as institutions of higher education by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science following a process overseen by the HEA. Once the relevant institutions are designated they will be entitled to use the title &ldquo;designated institution of higher education&rdquo;.  It is expected that Marino Institute of Education will meet the criteria for designation and will become a designated institution of higher education under this designation process. </p>  <p>  The HEA legislation will apply to all designated institutions of higher education. The model informing the proposed legislation is a co-regulation model which recognises the importance of autonomy and agility on the part of higher education institutions (HEIs) with appropriate accountability. This co-regulation model recognises and supports HEIs in their own governance responsibilities. The legislation will also provide the HEA with clarity as to its overall role in planning and managing at the system level but, where required, intervening proportionately to address issues if not appropriately dealt with by institutions.</p>  <p>  The legislation will also include a funding framework which will provide that the HEA may provide funding to a wide range of higher education institutions including Marino Institute of Education. This will replace the current system where many HEIs are funded directly through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science or the Department of Education. There will be consultation with the relevant HEIs, including Marino Institute of Education prior to the implementation of these changes. </p></reply>

My Department is aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties in March 2018, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established.  The Steering Group is leading on the identification of issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and overseeing its implementation. It is supported by an Implementation Group and a number of working groups which are considering specific areas of policy.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Supply Action Plan, published in November 2018, includes a range of actions under four policy headings: data/research to support teacher supply planning; higher education; policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply; and communications / promotion of the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to increase the supply of teachers at post-primary level, particularly in subjects where difficulties in recruitment have been reported.</p>  <p>  For the 2019/20 school year, my department introduced the &lsquo;Scheme to Share Teachers between Recognised Post-Primary Schools&rsquo; to facilitate an arrangement whereby two schools can share a teacher to teach subjects in both schools. The objectives of the Scheme are to assist schools in filling vacancies in high priority subjects and to enhance teaching hours for teachers in employment on less than full hours.  Circular 0015/2019 refers.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by education partners which are aimed at matching teachers  with teaching vacancies. </p>  <p>  Turasabhaile, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, matches registered teachers, resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools here at home. </p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network (IPPN) launched Sub Seeker, a central portal for short term substitute vacancies, jointly developed by IPPN/NAPD, in December 2019.  This service matches available teachers with short term substitute vacancies in primary and post primary schools. IPPN is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has also put additional measures in place for the current school year. As in 2020/21, flexible school placement arrangements are being implemented to enhance the availability of post-primary Professional Master of Education (PME) student teachers to fill short term substitute vacancies.</p>  <p>  The Council has also contacted all registered teachers requesting those not currently working, or those who otherwise have capacity to be available for substitute posts, to make themselves available through Sub Seeker. I am advised that the Council intends to repeat this awareness campaign with teachers on the register.</p>  <p>  A number of measures are also in place to support the supply of substitute teachers. These include suspending the restriction on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed and allowing teachers who are job sharing to work additional hours if available.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

CE also provides training supports for participants.</p><p>  I am aware of the challenges caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions and the resulting impact on many CE schemes including the recruitment of new participants.  Where it was safe and in accordance with public health restrictions,  some recruitment did continue during the pandemic, albeit on a more limited level than the norm.</p><p>  I have taken a number of measures to support CE schemes during the course of the pandemic.  These ensured participants were able to avail fully of the work experience and training opportunities available while enabling schemes maintain local community services.  In particular, participants whose contracts were due to come to an end since last October have had their contacts extended on a number of occasions.  The latest extension recently announced will continue up until February 2022.  This will allow further time to increase the number and rate of referrals to fill vacancies. </p><p>  Once normal CE operations return, it is important that these places are freed up and become available to the newer cohort of long term unemployed, including those whose jobs are permanently lost due to the pandemic.  Time spent on PUP will count towards eligibility for CE.  </p><p>  My Department has moved to restore activation services to pre-pandemic levels and is prioritising the referral and recruitment of eligible jobseekers to CE.  At the same time, my Department is considering initiatives to strengthen and further support the referral process from the Intreo Offices to individual CE schemes. </p><p>  Under Pathways to Work, my Department appointed almost 100 additional dedicated Job Coaches nationwide, to assist jobseekers in their efforts to return to full time employment.  Four  of these Job Coaches have been appointed to the Newbridge Intreo Centre.  The role of the Job Coaches includes the referral of eligible jobseekers to CE sponsoring authorities; if participation on this employment support would be of benefit.</p><p>  In line with Government&rsquo;s plans for the full re-opening of the economy, under 'Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting&rsquo;, my priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE schemes back providing normal services and supports to their long-term unemployed participants while delivering valuable services to local communities.  </p><p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as the Interim Total Contributions Approach) of pension calculation.  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.</p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.

The report has been published on the Government website.  It is extremely detailed, running to several hundred pages, and covers a range of complex matters in relation to the Pensions system which will require very careful consideration.  That will be done over the next 6 months with a view to bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by end of March 2022. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement.</p>  <p>  Section 83, which is in Part 8 of the Act and refers to the purpose of that Part, refers to the provisions relating to Advance Healthcare Directives(AHDs). Part 8 is principally the responsibility of the Minister for Health, though a single approach is being taken to unified commencements.</p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commence the 2015 Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform that it represents.  We are working towards a date of June 2022 for commencement of the 2015 Act and establishment of the Decision Support Service immediately thereafter.  An inter-departmental steering group is meeting regularly to prepare for commencement of the Act.</p>  <p>  Amendments are required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which will address a number of issues required to streamline processes and improve safeguards for those who will rely on the provisions of the Act.  I expect to be in a position to publish a Bill by year-end, and to see it enacted next year.</p></reply>

FET is also provided through community and voluntary groups, commercial training providers and in workplaces. </p>  <p>  There are currently 3 apprenticeships in the hospitality sector; Commis Chef (level 6), Chef de Partie (level 7) and Sous Chef (level 8).

The Department of Education currently funds Marino via capitation grants and grants in lieu of tuition fees in respect of approved student numbers on its primary ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The funding and governance remit for Marino Institute of Education is due to be moved to the Department of Higher Education; Research; Innovation and Science, as part of the process of transferring functions following on from the establishment of that Department. This work requires administrative and legislative solutions to address residual issues, and is in train as of now.</p>  <p>   I and my Department of officials are currently working on the reform of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971. The General Scheme of a Bill was published in May this year and I am considering the recommendations from the Pre-Legislative Scrutiny process on the General Scheme which was recently completed. It is anticipated that this Bill will be published shortly and initiated through the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 is being reformed to ensure that the higher education sector is enabled to meet the vision for an excellent higher education and research system which is innovative, adaptive and inclusive, which has strong engagement with the wider education system and wider society and which creates knowledge and contributes to social, economic and cultural development. This updated legislation is intended to provide the HEA with the necessary authority in relation to revised functions including planning, funding and oversight of the higher education sector and other related matters which more fully reflect its current central role and responsibilities in relation to higher education.</p>  <p>  The legislation will provide that the HEA will have oversight of the full higher education sector including teaching training colleges. The legislation includes a designation system which provides that all higher education institutions will become designated as institutions of higher education by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science following a process overseen by the HEA. Once the relevant institutions are designated they will be entitled to use the title &ldquo;designated institution of higher education&rdquo;.   It is expected that Marino Institute of Education will meet the criteria for designation and will become a designated institution of higher education under this designation process. </p>  <p>  The HEA legislation will apply to all designated institutions of higher education. The model informing the proposed legislation is a co-regulation model which recognises the importance of autonomy and agility on the part of higher education institutions (HEIs) with appropriate accountability. This co-regulation model recognises and supports HEIs in their own governance responsibilities. The legislation will also provide the HEA with clarity as to its overall role in planning and managing at the system level but, where required, intervening proportionately to address issues if not appropriately dealt with by institutions.</p>  <p>  The legislation will also include a funding framework which will provide that the HEA may provide funding to a wide range of higher education institutions including Marino Institute of Education. This will replace the current system where many HEIs are funded directly through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science or the Department of Education. There will be consultation with the relevant HEIs, including Marino Institute of Education prior to the implementation of these changes. </p></reply>

From these enquiries I understand that because the Donnycarney group was a pre-existing group, but new to the CDETB service, the first step was for the tutors to meet with the students and carry out an initial assessment. This happened during the week beginning the 27th September.  While students were invited to attend as a group for the following two weeks on shorter timetables than usual, I understand that the programme plan and timetable will be circulated to the group shortly.  I will confirm the details to the Deputy when available. </p></reply>

These schemes provide avenues for Afghan nationals to seek protection and for eligible family members living in Ireland to seek to have their close family members granted permission to reside in Ireland, where the relevant criteria are met. More than 670 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved an additional initiative: the special Afghan Admission Programme.  The Programme will allow places for up to 500 Afghan family members and each applicant will have an opportunity to nominate up to four family members who are currently residing in Afghanistan or who have fled to neighbouring territories and whom they consider would be especially at risk in terms of their freedom and safety.  </p>  <p>  The Programme is guided by the previous Syrian Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHAP) which also provided for the nomination of a limited number of close family members and by the IRPP Humanitarian Assistance Programme (IHAP), which included Afghan nationals.</p>  <p>  The Programme, including the detailed eligibility criteria and the application process, will be developed over the coming months, with a view to issuing a call for applications in December. The timescale provided is to ensure that the options considered are as inclusive as possible and that the programme is available to those that most require our help. The intervening time is required to develop the details of the programme, including a guidance document for applicants, application form, decision making criteria and the appeals process. The clearer the application process is made at the outset, the quicker we will be able to process applications in the interests of those concerned.  </p>  <p>  I believe that these initiatives meet the call from interested NGOs and civil society organisations on the Government to lead in its response to this crisis. The Afghan Admission Programme is unique across the EU and was hailed by UNHCR as a very welcome commitment by the Government that will bring much solace to Afghans who are worried about their relatives abroad. </p></reply>

Staffing levels determined by the SSF are directed and implemented based on evidence from patient / resident outcomes as the key indicator of the staffing adjustment needed. This flexibility has proven successful in the previous two phases of the SSF.  </p><p>The National Taskforce for Phase 3 of the SSF commenced in February 2021 and has undertaken a review of the available international evidence and selected a model for further testing. Following an open call, nine pilot sites have been chosen from across the country to test the model identified. Baseline data collection will commence in Q3 2021, with staffing adjustments expected to be made in the pilot sites in Q1 2022. Based on the evidence Phase 3 (a) will, in line with other phases, be developed into a national policy for broader implementation. This flexible , evidence based approach to nurse staffing and skill mix will enable informed staffing levels based on patient / resident need across the variety of nursing home / residential care settings in Ireland.</p></reply>

The combination of supports in the location, outreach supports, and remote supports provides an overall quantum of support to service users of over 60% at the end of January. The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff. This funding provided an increase in day services by an average of one day a week for 14,940 people against September 2020 service levels. </p>  <p>  I was very pleased to announce last month that adult day services for people with disabilities will return to full capacity by October 22nd, in line with our COVID 19 response  &lsquo;Reframing the Challenge&rsquo; roadmap for the lifting of restrictions.   </p>  <p>  Day service providers have been requested to develop their individual day service location roadmaps to increase the level of day service provision to 100% restoration for each day service user by October 22nd.  </p>  <p>  Infection prevention and control measures that have been introduced to support the safe delivery of adult disability day services since the onset of COVID 19 will remain in place after October 22nd. These arrangements include risk assessments, enhanced environmental hygiene, and pod like arrangements in day service locations. Mask wearing will remain in place in day services, except for those who are exempt from wearing a face covering. </p>  <p>  I also note that on 2nd September, also in line with the government statement on &lsquo;Reframing the Challenge&rsquo;, the HSE issued guidance to all providers that day service transport can now return to 100% capacity, with all relevant infection prevention and control measures still to be observed, including the wearing of face coverings where possible and appropriate for service users.  </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. I note that there are several services located at the same site that the Deputy has referred to in the question, and the response provided above relates solely to HSE-funded disability services. </p></reply>

There are 17 health and social care professions designated for regulation under the Act and currently there are registers open for 11 professions. The profession of osteopathy is not, however, designated for regulation.  </p><p>Section 4 of the 2005 Act provides that, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister for Health can make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already designated under the Act.The Department has received requests from approximately 25 health and social care professions to be statutorily regulated, including osteopaths.  Consideration of which health and social care professions require statutory regulation to protect the public, and the identification of the proportionate degree of regulatory force required to achieve this aim, are highly complex.  It was decided last year that the  Health Research Board would be requested to carry out research on behalf of the Department on methods adopted in other jurisdictions on the regulation of health and social care professions to assist and inform the question of risk assessment within the context of professional regulation. This research has been received and is being examined by Department officials. The report is publicly available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ea62b-national-approaches-to-regulating-health-and-social-care-professions/</i>.</p><p>In the meantime, CORU continues the complex work of preparing for regulation under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 the professions already designated for regulation.</p><p>I hope this information is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government intends to place the administrative NI PHS on a statutory basis and an extensive examination of options to inform the drafting of a General Scheme is currently underway.

Imports must be accompanied by an Official Statement to attest to the origin of the roundwood and are subject to inspection. </p>  <p>  The volume of imports from the PFA have increased in 2020 and 2021 as sawmills and processors have become more reliant on this as a source of raw material due to an increase in global demand for timber and delays in licencing timber for felling domestically.</p>  <p>  However, in recent months significant improvements have been made in the issuing of licences for felling and forest roads with the timber volume licensed to date in 2021 almost 1 million cubic metres ahead of the total for 2020, and an equivalent year on year increase in forest road approvals. It is anticipated that this will have an impact on the volume of timber available domestically thus reducing the reliance on imported roundwood.</p></reply>

The Department compiles a list of Registered Foresters once they meet the criteria for registration, which is to hold at a minimum, an ordinary bachelor&rsquo;s degree in forestry, (National Framework of Qualifications Level 7). It is envisaged that the same condition would apply to schemes under the successor to the current Forestry Programme (extended to end 2022) which will be delivered entirely separately from the CAP Strategic Plan.</p>  <p>  Under the Forestry Act 2014, a forest is defined as an area of at least 0.1 hectare in size and a tree crown cover of more than 20% of the total area, or the potential to achieve this cover at maturity.</p>  <p>  In terms of Eco-Schemes, these are being proposed for the first time as part of the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and will be funded from within Pillar 1 of the CAP budget.  Eco-schemes are mandatory for Member States but voluntary for farmers. From January 2023 onwards, for the duration of the next CAP, the Eco-Scheme will be implemented annually in Ireland, with active farmers having the opportunity to opt in or out on an annual basis. The purpose of this scheme is to provide additional direct income support to farmers for undertaking agricultural practices beneficial to the climate, environment and biodiversity. Farmers will be able to apply for the Eco-Scheme at the same time as their BISS application and it will not be mandatory for a farmer to engage an appropriately trained agricultural advisor to either apply for or comply with the Eco scheme.</p>  <p>  Farmers can, of course, avail of the services of appropriately trained agricultural advisors or foresters in applying for or complying with the requirements of the Eco-scheme if they so wish.</p>  <p>  With regard to the new multi-annual Agri-Environment Scheme which will also be included under Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, it is proposed that under this scheme farmers will have the option to plant trees and/or hedges.  It is proposed that it will be mandatory for applicants to avail of the services of appropriately trained agricultural advisors in applying for and complying with the requirements of this scheme. It will also be open to scheme applicants to avail of additional professional services if they wish to do so.     </p></reply>

This is seen as a critical policy in order to ensure that quotas are not concentrated into the hands of large fishing companies whose owners have the financial resources to buy up such rights. In Ireland, any movement towards privatisation and concentration of rights into the hands of large companies would seriously risk fishing vessels losing an economic link with Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities and undermining the socio-economic importance of the fishing industry in the coastal communities dependent on fishing. The result of this long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities. </p>  <p>  Whitefish (Demersal) Quotas are generally managed on a monthly basis with catch limits being set for each month. Consultation is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. The purpose of these meetings is to make recommendations to me on monthly/bi-monthly/quarterly regimes for particular stocks and, as far as possible, I follow their recommendations for regimes for particular stocks, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries. Additional meetings are organised as required to discuss specific issues in particular fisheries that may arise. </p>  <p>  The QMAC operate by examining in detail the operation of each fishery, uptake patterns and available quota for the different metiers of fishing vessels, including inshore fishing vessels. There are detailed discussions on allocations, often taking account of the divergent situation of the fleet and of the market. The QMAC may also take account of the weather/sea conditions in the preceding quota period and the impact this may have had on the industry during that period, particularly in respect of the smaller vessels. It also has the possibility of recommending additional catch limits to incentivise the introduction of environmentally friendly fishing gear in particular fisheries or for particular types of vessels. </p>  <p>  The fish quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread both between fishing vessel operators and in terms of take up of quota during the year. The arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas. Any amendments or changes to the overarching policy on management arrangements can be determined by me following detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry. </p>  <p>  A key objective of whitefish quota management is the avoidance of very early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. This is particularly important because our whitefish fisheries are mixed and an early closure would impact on other fisheries where there would be a potential by-catch of such stocks and would undermine the effective implementation of the landing obligation which prohibits discarding of fish at sea.</p>  <p>  There are 9 principal managed pelagic stocks (Mackerel, Irish Sea Herring, Celtic Sea Herring, North West Herring, Atlanto-Scandian Herring, Horse Mackerel, Blue Whiting, Boarfish and Albacore Tuna) and the particular management of each is further subdivided between various sectors of the fleet. The fishing of pelagic species is generally confined to the spring and the autumn. Since 1 January 2015 pelagic stocks have also been subject to the landing obligation.  Pelagic issues, effort issues and deep sea issues, where relevant, are also discussed at the QMAC and recommendations brought to my attention to inform my decision. </p></reply>

This year, in line with <i>Our Rural Future</i>, a key focus is to renovate derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres to bring them back into use as multipurpose spaces, remote working hubs or as residential accommodation.</p><p>In the last 12 months, funding of &euro;15.4 million has been approved under the main Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 147 projects countrywide, including 4 projects in County Kildare approved for funding of some &euro;440,000. </p><p>The Scheme is responsive to the evolving challenges faced by our towns and villages. Last year, a separate measure was introduced to respond to the challenges presented by the pandemic. This Accelerated Measure addressed short-term challenges of increasing footfall and assisting local businesses and communities to adapt to public health requirements. 15 such projects were funded across Kildare, including projects in Athy , KIldare Town, Newbridge and Cellbridge</p><p>More recently, the &euro;7 million Streetscape Enhancement Measure was introduced to help improve the visual appearance of approximately 120 towns and villages the length and breadth of the country. This includes Ballitore, Castledermot, Kilcock, Monasterevin, Rathangan and Sallins which were nominated for inclusion in the Measure in County Kildare. </p><p>I am confident that the scheme will continue to develop and expand in the coming years in response to evolving needs.</p></reply>

The PPNs are the main link between these groups and their local authorities, and they enable the groups to make their voices heard within formal local decision-making structures. My Department supports and advances PPNs at a national level and they are accountable to my Department for their use of public monies and the activities they undertake on behalf of their communities.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that PPNs are wholly independent entities and decide for themselves what networking and capacity-building supports they wish to provide to their member groups within the overarching objectives for the PPNs.</p>  <p>  Over the past 2 years, my Department has provided direct funding of &euro;151,400 to each of the 31 PPNs around the country (&euro;75,700 in each year) as well as providing structural supports, and this will continue into the future.  This funding supports the ongoing development of the PPNs. The Department also chairs and provides administrative support to the National PPN Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently funding and advancing a number of important national initiatives and key recommendations made by PPN stakeholders in the PPNs' Annual Reports to promote their development (e.g. training, awareness-raising, IT support, visions for community wellbeing).</p>  <p>  Two important initiatives supported by my Department in this regard are: the national training course for PPN stakeholders, which is currently ongoing, and a communications and awareness campaign due to be rolled out in 2022. The Department published a PPN Handbook in 2020 to assist and guide the PPNs and stakeholders in their day-to-day work. My Department is also working to set up an advisory service to give PPNs easy access to expert advice on best practice for operational questions related to HR and governance, which will be available to all PPNs starting in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department commissioned an independent review of PPN structures, which is considering the internal structures of PPNs themselves as well as the supports available to them. The review report is due in November and is expected to make recommendations on how to further improve PPN structures. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to continuing to support PPNs both financially and structurally so that local communities can continue to have an influence on matters that affect them.</p></reply>

The Scheme is administered at a local level by the relevant Local Authorities.</p><p>I launched the 2021 Scheme on 14th May with funding of &euro;10.5 million.
