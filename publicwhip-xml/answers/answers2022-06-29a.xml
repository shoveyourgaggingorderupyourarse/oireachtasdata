    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-29a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062900074#WRA00500"><p>2021 was a record year for FDI in Ireland. IDA Ireland won 249 investments, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s market share of investment into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. The number of people directly employed in multinational companies in Ireland grew to over 275,000. FDI investment decisions were taken not only within the context of the OECD International Tax negotiations, but also during an uncertain environment due to Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. These results demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as an FDI destination.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s signing of the OECD International Tax agreement in July 2021 provided stability to prospective and current multinational companies investing in Ireland. While the high-level agreement was reached in 2021, the specifics of how the new rules will operate in practice remain to be seen. IDA and its client companies are monitoring these international developments closely, and recent FDI investments would indicate that Ireland is still attractive to FDI investors. The corporation tax rate is only one aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition to MNCs. Companies investing in Ireland also reap the benefits of a young and highly educated workforce, a business-friendly environment, a stable economic and political environment, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to European Union membership and access to the single market. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland report that globally, efforts to secure FDI are currently affected by issues such as disrupted global supply chains, increased energy costs and potential supply issues, increased construction and infrastructure costs  - all issues which have been impacted by the pandemic and geopolitical events. </p>  <p>  In order to provide an appropriate response to current economic and geopolitical challenges, in March Government agreed to the development of a White Paper on Enterprise Policy by the end of the year, led by my Department. The White Paper will set out an ambitious medium-to long-term direction for enterprise policy. In so doing, the White Paper will articulate what needs to be done differently to realise this vision and to set out clearly the risks to be faced, and the policy choices that will arise in order to maintain high-quality jobs, and to protect the elements, including FDI, which make Ireland&rsquo;s economy globally attractive for investment.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. Mortgage service provision enterprises would fall outside the scope of eligible businesses for grant aid under the Local Enterprise Office network.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices provide soft supports through a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is a new start up or growing an existing business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option or for those who are currently operating a business. The Local Enterprise Offices offer free training and development programmes and mentoring and networking events.</p></reply>

The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland and Europe is high international gas prices where we are a price taker. Gas prices are now unprecedentedly high, which feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p><p>Government has already taken action and 99% of domestic electricity accounts have now been credited with the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT). The total cost of this scheme is c&euro;380 million. This is in addition to the range of measures introduced on 10 February to address increasing costs of living, including the lump sum payment for people on the Fuel Allowance of &euro;125, paid to recipients in March. Furthermore, a &euro;320 million measure has been introduced to temporarily reduce excise duties on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil, which cut excise by 20c per litre of petrol and 15c per litre of diesel.</p><p>Government published the National Energy Security Framework detailing consumer supports and protections already in place and that are being enhanced including:</p><p>  - an additional &euro;100 Fuel Allowance payment,</p><p>  - a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons</p><p>  - a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p><p>On June 14th Government announced a package of measures to secure electricity supplies including an indicative annual saving of &euro;75 on household bills through a further reduction in the PSO levy.</p></reply>

The scheme is operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) and electricity suppliers with oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p><p>This is an exceptional measure which uses the single eligibility criterion of an electricity meter point registration number (MPRN), to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible this year, without any additional means testing. The payment is being applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2), as set out in section 1 of the Act.</p><p>As of 27 May 2022, 2,129,832 domestic electricity customers had been credited, with 1,845,142 of these customers having been notified via a line item on their bill or prepayment vend receipt. This means that 99% of all eligible customers had the credit applied to their account.</p><p>In cases where households are in rental accommodation and do not have an individual MPRN, where tenants have disputes relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.</p></reply>

It was established under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The CCAC works to provide contributions in critiquing, informing and shaping Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change.As part of this work, the CCAC provides regular reports regarding Ireland&rsquo;s progress in achieving its national policy goals and greenhouse gas emissions targets agreed by the European Union. </p><p>The 2021 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act strengthened the role of the CCAC, tasking it with preparing and submitting proposed carbon budgets to the Minister of Environment, Climate and Communications for their consideration. To support this role CCAC has been expanded from eleven to fourteen members, and there are provisions that future appointments will provide for improved gender balance and a greater range of relevant expertise </p><p>As part of its work, the Council is responsible for proposing the carbon budget programme to assist the State in achieving its national climate objectives and greenhouse gas emissions targets agreed by the European Union. </p><p>The CCAC&rsquo;s proposed carbon budget programme was published and submitted to my Department in October 2021.In December 2021, CCAC&rsquo;s proposed budgets were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and were referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action. </p><p>In February this year, Government approved the carbon budgets as proposed by the CCAC. </p><p>Funding is provided to the CCAC via the Environmental Protection Agency and since its establishment the following amounts have been paid to the CCAC. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Non-pay</td>       <td>&euro;99,145 </td>       <td>&euro;269,000</td>       <td>&euro;227,393</td>       <td>&euro;270,068</td>       <td>&euro;590,534</td>       <td>&euro;512,083</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Salary Costs</td>       <td>&euro;343,877 </td>       <td>&euro;402,114</td>       <td>&euro;358,164</td>       <td>&euro;391,472</td>       <td>&euro;386,812</td>       <td>&euro;373,920</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>&euro;443,022</td>       <td>&euro;671,114</td>       <td>&euro;585,557</td>       <td>&euro;661,540</td>       <td>&euro;977,346</td>       <td>&euro;886,003</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

However, with the Programme for Government commitment to substantially increase our climate ambition, including our 2050 objective, submission of Ireland&rsquo;s draft LTS to the European Commission was paused to ensure it fully aligned with our enhanced climate ambition. </p><p>  In July 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted giving legal effect to a 2050 climate neutrality target. The Act also provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, and puts in place a rigorous governance structure, including a requirement for Government to prepare a National Long-term Climate Action Strategy at least once every five-years. </p><p>  As we finalise Ireland&rsquo;s LTS, we are ensuring that the ambition aligns with our recently legislated for national climate targets, as well as making a strong contribution to the overall EU ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and achieving an interim reduction in overall EU greenhouse gas emissions of 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Similarly, the LTS will support our commitment to the international objective of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels, as established under the Paris Climate Agreement, and recently reaffirmed in the Glasgow Climate Pact. </p><p>  Ireland, as one of five Member States still to submit its Long-term Climate Strategy, has continued to engage with the European Commission on this issue, and has fully appraised the Commission of the approach as set out above.</p></reply>

The ESRI recently published analysis which indicates that, following the recent sharp increases in energy prices, the share of households that could be at risk of energy poverty has risen to 29.4%. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases. The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households that are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits.</p>  <p>  Recognising the unprecedented rise in energy prices facing people the Government put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March;</p>  <p>  - the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to domestic electricity accounts;</p>  <p>  - specific measures in the new National Retrofit Schemes to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:</p>  <p>  - a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons;</p>  <p>  - a package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors;</p>  <p>  - a review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term;</p>  <p>  - the continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022;</p>  <p>  - a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October;</p>  <p>  - an additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance;</p>  <p>  - the reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, electricity and gas suppliers, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions.</p><p>Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased and very generous grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%).</p><p>  The Scheme introduces a new way to undertake home energy upgrades with One-Stop-Shops providing an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors to deliver the work; and quality assuring the work.</p><p>  Homes, built and occupied pre-2011, and owned by private homeowners, non-corporate landlords and Approved Housing Bodies are eligible for the scheme. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for people all over Ireland to upgrade to a warmer, healthier and more comfortable home, with lower energy bills.</p><p>  In addition, Government have been clear that it is important that households that want to undertake a deep retrofit but do not have the financial means to carry out the upgrade in a single project, should be supported at the enhanced grant levels. For that reason, many of the new higher grant rates are also now available under the Better Energy Homes Scheme allowing homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage the project. The One Stop Shops can support homeowners under either scheme.</p><p>  Window and door replacements are available under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, as well as under the Community Energy Grant scheme, as part of a whole house upgrade solution, as required, to achieve an energy efficient home to B2. </p><p>  Window and door replacement are also available in some circumstances under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme which delivers free upgrades to eligible homeowners in low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. </p><p>  Window and door replacements are not supported under the Better Energy Homes Scheme, where homeowners can choose to carry out works on a step by step, and/or, self-managed basis.</p><p>  There are no plans at present to change this policy.</p></reply>

The District Heating Steering Group, which has met six times so far this year, is working towards recommendations around issues such as: robust governance; the optimum regulatory framework; organisational and structural designs and, legislative, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive. The considerations in this regard encompass pre-existing district heating and local heating schemes that are already in operation in Ireland. The recommendations of the Steering Group will be included in its Report to Government, scheduled for Q3 of this year.</p>  <p>  Gas and electricity retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. I am acutely aware of the impact that current, internationally influenced, energy price increases are having on people and families. For that reason, Government has put in place a series of measures to help alleviate the impact, particularly on lower income households.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Renewable Energy Directive includes, inter alia, provisions concerning use of unavoidable waste heat when planning district heating and provisions requiring Member States to facilitate the development of heating and cooling derived from renewable sources. District heating, within a structured framework, is a technology that: offers the potential to diversify fuel supply used to heat the building sector; can offer flexibility in fuel choice; and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscape. </p></reply>

It coordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a &lsquo;Whole-of Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability.  </p>  <p>  Although Ireland is not as dependent on Russian gas as other Member States, it is important that we continue to be vigilant and cooperate closely with our European counterparts.  In recent weeks Russia has disrupted supplies to an increasing number of EU Member States.  Regularly tested emergency plans are in place which could be activated, if necessary, by Gas Networks Ireland - Ireland&rsquo;s gas transmission system operator (TSO) and designated National Gas Emergency Manager.  In addition, there are protocols in place between the UK and Ireland TSOs to deal manage gas supply emergencies</p>  <p>  The short to medium term oil supply outlook is positive, with petroleum product availability having improved somewhat in the last few weeks and no major supply difficulties expected by industry in the immediate term.

In this context, a number of measures have been taken to ensure services remain affordable.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, my department secured approximately &euro;538m of funding for Public Service Obligation (PSO) and Local Link services. &euro;25m was also provided for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC).  This new measure will enable any person aged between 19 and 23 years old to avail of an average fare discount of 50% across all public transport services, including city, intercity and rural services.</p>  <p>  As part of a suite of new measures introduced by Government to help combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country, a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services has also been introduced. These discounted fares, which will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day, will cost &euro;54m and will be in place until the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. </p>  <p>  In relation to the road haulage sector, on 15 March the Government approved an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme (LHESS) - to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. The Scheme provided support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. Over &euro;15 million has been paid out under the Scheme to nearly 3,000 operators. </p>  <p>  In addition to the LHESS and in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, on 10 March the Government introduced an excise duty reduction of 15 cent per litre of diesel, initially introduced until end August but later extended out to Budget Day. </p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. There were around 1,000 claimants for DRS in 2021 and this has likely increased in 2022. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, tax debt &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; during the COVID crisis remains at an interest rate of 0% for the remainder of this year.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the impacts of increasing biofuel rates on fuel prices, an offsetting policy measure of a 1c per litre reduction in the NORA Levy and a 1c per litre reduction in excise has been introduced in agreement with the Minister for Finance. The excise relief takes effect from 1 April 2022 and will be in place until Budget Day in October 2022.</p></reply>

One of the issues examined was eligibility. Disability groups in particular were unhappy that some permits were issued for medical conditions, rather than mobility impairment. The scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment, rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness. This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria  to include people with non-mobility related physical disabilities or conditions, or those with certain forms of intellectual or cognitive impairment, has been raised on a number of occasions and the Department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association, on this matter. In light of this consultation, there are currently no plans to change the criteria.</p>  <p>  I and my department appreciate that everyday life with a condition such as Crohn's Disease can be challenging. I must emphasise to the Deputy, however, that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and, crucially, compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces for those who need them the most.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-29a.64.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062900075#WRB02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment. The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. For this reason, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling.</p>  <p>  A move to include other properties previously used as a residential home/second-hand properties within the scope of the scheme itself would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. Extending the HTB scheme in this way would provide no incentive effect to encourage the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. For these reasons, I currently have no plans to extend the HTB scheme to include such properties.</p>  <p>  In respect of the maximum purchase value for a qualifying property to be eligible for HTB, the most recently available data from the Central Statistics Office, relating to April 2022, indicate that the average sale price in the case of first time buyer owner occupiers nationally is &euro;372,900 and for Dublin the equivalent figure is &euro;472,100.  Also, when we look at the breakdown of HTB claims by house price set out in Revenue's annual statistical report on the scheme for 2021, it sets out that some 76% of successful HTB claims in 2021 were for properties below &euro;375,000 in value.  While not necessarily conclusive in terms of providing a guide as to the maximum purchase price that should apply under the scheme, these figures offer a perspective on the current maximum of &euro;500,000. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies may be aware, work by external consultants on the review of HTB is currently underway and, in fact, is nearing completion. The outcome of this review will help to inform decisions on the future of the scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022. However, this is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of the Budget 2023 process and it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment at this time.</p></reply>

These include the fact that demand for oil and other energy products such as natural gas has increased sharply following the re-opening of many economies in the second half of last year, as well as the impact of the war in Ukraine which continues to negatively affect international energy prices. </p><p>It is important to note at the outset that there are constraints on what the Government can do on both excise and VAT rates applying to fuel products such as diesel as a result of EU Directives. </p><p>On the excise front, Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is based on European Union law as set out in the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply.  In the case of diesel, which is used as a propellant, the minimum rate is &euro;330.00 per 1000 Litres exclusive of VAT.  This equates to 33 cents per litre.  The March 9th (pre reduction) rate of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) on diesel was 53.55 cent per litre exclusive of VAT.  This point therefore represented the starting point for Government action in relation to excise reductions on diesel.</p><p>As you are aware, the Government excise reductions for diesel implemented in March and April 2022 have brought the overall MOT rate to 40.54 cents per litre (VAT exclusive). This represents just over 7.5 cent per litre over the EU minimum rate of 33 cents per litre. However, any scope for further reduction is removed by the fact that the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), which has been in operation since 2013 and is currently at its maximum payment level of 7.5 cent per litre, brings the effective rate of excise paid to 33.04 cents (VAT exclusive) for those availing of the relief.  It is not possible to increase the DRS repayment amount by any further material amount as it would bring the effective rate below the ETD.  </p><p>The table below provides a comparison of  MOT Rates, Effective Rates and ETD Minimum from  October 21 to April 22. <table>    <tr>       <th>Auto-diesel rates/1,000L from </th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon</th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>Effective MOT incl.

In addition, a Member State can have two reduced rates. Ireland&rsquo;s standard rate is 23%, and its two reduced rates are 13.5% and 9% respectively.</p><p>Annex III of the VAT Directive determines what products and services can fall into the reduced rate categories. In this regard, it should be noted that petrol and diesel are standard rated products. Therefore, the rate of VAT is 23%. There is no potential for them being classified as reduced rates.  </p><p>As there can only be one standard rate of VAT, any reduction in this rate must be applied to all other products and services that fall into this standard rate category. What this means therefore is that there is a very significant exchequer cost for any reduction in the standard rate.  For instance reducing it by 1% would cost approximately &euro;542m per annum. A reduction in VAT on diesel to 15% the minimum rate at which the standard rate can be set would cost the Exchequer &euro;4.34 billion in revenue.</p><p>In relation to the issue of VAT being charged on other taxes, the Deputy should note that Revenue advise that this is standard practice. Further details can be found at the following link: www.revenue.ie/en/vat/charging-vat/on-what-amount-do-you-charge-vat/index.aspx  <b></b></p><p>In summary, you will note that the Government has brought excise rates on diesel to the minimum level under EU rules through a combination of an excise reduction, and the application of the DRS. </p></reply>

The incapacitated individual can be the claimant themselves, or the claimant&rsquo;s spouse or relative. The tax relief is given by way of a deduction and is equal to the lower of the cost incurred and &euro;75,000. </p>  <p>  The incapacitated child tax credit of &euro;3,300, as provided for in section 465 TCA 1997, is available to an individual who proves that he or she has living, at any time during the year of assessment, a child who:</p>  <p>  1. if under the age of 18, is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity to such an extent that there is a reasonable expectation that the child would be incapacitated from maintaining him or herself if they were over the age of 18; or</p>  <p>  2. if over the age of 18, is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining him or herself and had become so incapacitated either before attaining the age of 21 or whilst in full-time instruction at any university, college school or other educational establishment. </p>  <p>  The dependent relative tax credit of &euro;245, as provided for in section 466 TCA 1997, is available to an individual who maintains, at his or her own expense, a relative who is unable to maintain him or herself or a widowed parent. The credit is also available where an individual depends on his or her own child, due to infirmity, and resides with and maintains the child at his or her own expense. Eligibility for the dependent relative credit is subject to the requirement that the relative, child or widowed parent&rsquo;s income for the year does not exceed a specified amount provided for in the legislation. </p>  <p>  Where the individual employs a carer to look after an incapacitated person and also qualifies for either the incapacitated child tax credit or the dependent relative credit in respect of that same incapacitated person, he or she may claim relief under both section 467 and section 465 and/or 466 TCA 1997 as appropriate. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that tax relief under section 467 TCA 1997 cannot be claimed where the individual employed to take care of an incapacitated person is the same individual in respect of whom the claimant receives either the incapacitated child or dependent relative tax credits. </p>  <p>  The Deputy also refers to the home carer tax credit in his Question.  The home carer tax credit of &euro;1,600, as provided for in section 466A TCA 1997, is available to jointly assessed married couples or civil partners where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to take care of a dependent person. The carer may earn up to &euro;7,200 per year without affecting the value of the credit awarded, however once the carer&rsquo;s income exceeds this amount the value of the credit will be impacted. </p>  <p>  Where an individual employs a carer to take care of an incapacitated individual it is unlikely that he or she will also be eligible to claim the home carer tax credit as it is a requirement, under section 466A TCA 1997, for the individual to care for the dependent person himself or herself in order to qualify for the home carer credit. The facts and circumstances of each individual case determine the entitlement to tax relief however, additional tax relief will generally not be due in such a scenario.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of making taxpayers aware of their tax credit entitlements, I am advised that Revenue pro-actively corresponds with different cohorts of taxpayers to publicise the range of credits which they may be entitled to claim.  For example, Revenue is currently in the process of writing to all PAYE taxpayers whose final tax position for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 is not yet balanced.  This communications process may also prompt individual taxpayers to claim as yet unclaimed tax credits.  </p>  <p>  Detailed guidance material on each of these credits and reliefs is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website and can be found at the following links:</p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-20.pdf  </p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-05.pdf  </p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-27.pdf  </p>  <p>  - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-29.pdf</p>  <p>  Any individual who requires assistance in determining the full range of tax credits and reliefs which he or she may be entitled to claim, should contact Revenue through MyAccount - </p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/support/data-and-security/security/revenue.ie-and-myaccount.aspx</p></reply>

This is emphasised in all engagements with KBC, who meet with officials from my Department on a monthly basis.</p><p>On 25 June 2021, the Central Bank, as the relevant competent authority, issued a Dear CEO letter to the main retail banks setting out its consumer protection<i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i>expectationsin a changing retail banking landscape.

(See link - www.kbc.ie/important-update-from-kbc-bank-ireland).

I believe that this agreement represents a fair compromise reflecting the competing interests of the many countries involved in the negotiations, large and small, developed and developing. </p>  <p>  The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly but I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century.  </p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the international tax system needs to adapt to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted in an increasingly globalised and digitalised world. The last decade has been one of unprecedented change for multinational companies, with many anti-BEPS measures being introduced to tackle perceived tax avoidance. While these measures have been necessary, they have undeniably increased complexity for businesses.</p>  <p>  This is a global issue, which requires global action to solve in a coordinated way, in order to avoid the proliferation of unilateral tax measures and trade tensions. The OECD agreement will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework, based on a shared understanding of where value is created in digital business models. This stability is of critical importance for business investment. This agreement will come at a cost, a substantial cost even, to Ireland in terms of reduced tax receipts, but I believe that this is a price worth paying to bring certainty and stability to the global trading environment and move away from the risk of trade wars, the impact of which would be amplified at a time of economic challenge.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in recent years in implementing international tax reforms, and stakeholder engagement has been an essential element of this process. I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap in 2018 to provide a clear line of sight for businesses on future planned reforms and updated it in 2021 to mark the concrete actions we have taken to adapt to agreed new international standards. My Department facilitates extensive engagement with stakeholders in advance of most new legislative measures being introduced, and this collaborative, transparent process provides certainty both to businesses already established here and those considering investing.</p>  <p>  It is therefore my view that a considered, collaborative implementation of the Pillar Two minimum tax agreement, in conjunction with our EU and OECD partners, continues to be in the best interests both of Ireland and of globalised businesses investing here. </p></reply>

Further, the scope for provision of services within the Union will be enhanced by the adoption of digital financial technologies already underway.</p>  <p>  However, I fully appreciate that enhanced sustainable competition in the credit and banking market more generally will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers. Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is underway in my Department will assess various aspects of the banking market and will consider options to encourage greater competition in the credit and banking market, including possible options to develop the mortgage market.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.  </p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency (LDA) has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which is expected to bring essential more long-term stability to the Irish housing market.  It is also tasked with unlocking stalled private, planning-consented developments in the shorter-term through its market engagement initiative - Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  The target under Project Tosaigh is the delivery of 5,000 new homes by 2026 for affordable cost rental or sale to eligible households under affordable purchase arrangements. This is in addition to the 2,800 affordable and social homes to be delivered from the initial state lands that the LDA are currently working on.</p>  <p>  Housing for All identified a further 20 sites for transfer to the LDA with the potential to deliver up to 15,000 homes and in many cases  form part of a major revitalisation of  urban centres, with benefits to the wider  community from the scale of associated  social and community infrastructure  which will be planned and delivered  in tandem with the residential units.  Government departments will work  closely together to identify further  appropriate lands that could be  developed for housing.</p>  <p>  The LDA is also working in partnership with local authorities to support housing delivery on key strategic local authority sites.  A good example of this is the D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council scheme at Shanganagh, Shankill which received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2020 and is projected to deliver 597 new homes: 306 Cost Rental, 200 social housing and 91 to be sold under the affordable purchase scheme.</p>  <p>  The Q1 2022 Housing for All progress report detailing proposals and progress on the LDA's active sites over both the short and long term can be accessed on the following link: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/9f667-housing-for-all-q1-2022-progress-report/</p></reply>

It is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may provide households with social housing support under RAS or HAP until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. </p>  <p>  Support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the local authority at prescribed intervals. The household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. If the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time it was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer.</p></reply>

While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011. </p>  <p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. Building control authorities liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to focus on the extractive industries sector and expand upon the programme commenced in 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, in October of last year I requested a Market Surveillance Audit of all quarries in Donegal which was carried out by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office in partnership with Donegal County Council and Geological Survey Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives above, Market Surveillance Authorities respond to complaints raised, therefore any information on suspected non-compliance should be submitted in writing (detailing as much information as possible) to either the appropriate local Market Surveillance Authority and/or the National Building Control Office and Market Surveillance Office (NBCO&amp;MSO). The Local Market Surveillance Authority may be contacted through the City or County Council. NBC&amp;MSO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie</p>  <p>  Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:</p>  <p>  - when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,</p>  <p>  - when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,</p>  <p>  - check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and</p>  <p>  - ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p>  <p>  My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the Marketing and Use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This guide aims to facilitate clearer communication within the supply chain regarding the declared performance of essential characteristics of concrete blocks having regard to national provisions in Ireland. Guidance is also provided for specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users who when specifying and choosing aggregate concrete blocks, they should ensure that the construction products are fit for intended use and the conditions in which they are to be used. Appropriate specifications and choices will help secure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022, which will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing, is currently going through the legislative process in the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted shortly.  Its main objective is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register is critical for the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p></reply>

However, the vast majority of all first time applications are processed within the current turnaround time of 25 working days. This turnaround time has been reduced by 40% since March. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the additional staff that have recently been assigned to the Passport Service will result in a further reduction in turnaround times for first time and complex applications, including those from Northern Ireland. Turnaround time applies to fully complete and correct applications. Applications which are incomplete and require further supporting documents will take longer.</p></reply>

The Agreement sets out that a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland should be based on the European Convention on Human Rights, enhanced by additional rights to &ldquo;reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem.&rdquo;</p><p>The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent implementation agreements is a central priority for this Government. </p><p>The Government advanced the view during the 2014 Stormont House talks that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based.  While there was not sufficient consensus to take this forward, the final Agreement did provide that the parties commit to: &ldquo;serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.&rdquo;</p><p>  As agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, an Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper on the &ldquo;Key Issues for a Bill of Rights&rdquo; in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May.  </p><p>  At present, the Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has concluded holding formal evidence gathering sessions on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. The next step, as agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, is for the First and deputy First Ministers to jointly appoint a Panel of five experts to assist the Committee in preparing its report. </p><p>However, as an Executive has not yet been formed following the Assembly elections, this step cannot be taken at present. The progression of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is one of the reasons that it is essential that the parties, and those representatives that have been elected by the people, to come together to establish an Executive. The Irish Government will continue to work to support this vital goal.</p><p>As outlined in the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA. </p><p>Last week, the British Government published legislation to introduce a UK Bill of Rights, which if enacted would repeal and replace the Human Rights Act. The Bill requires serious and detailed consideration now. However, it is important, at this early stage, to be clear that the Good Friday Agreement cites the European Convention on Human Rights as a vital safeguard that ensures the operation of the Agreement's institutions and the protection of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s communities.</p><p>It is vital that all the people of Northern Ireland can have full confidence in the protection of their human rights, in order to continue to build deeper reconciliation and lasting peace.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  An eligible child for whom no transport service is available may, following an application for transport within prescribed time limits, receive a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements. This grant is also payable for eligible children who may have to travel 3.2 kms or more to or from a designated pick up/set down point.</p>  <p>  While there are currently no plans to increase the Remote Area Grant rates at this time, the Government announced a reduction in excise on fuel will resulted in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is analysing the views of all relevant stakeholders so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;170million on supports for schools under the DEIS programme in 2022. </p>  <p>  In the region of &euro;16.2 million was provided to primary and post primary schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2021/22 school year. The purpose of this DEIS specific funding is to support the objectives of the DEIS programme, including retention, attendance, literacy and numeracy. The DEIS programme provides a suite of supports to specifically support educational disadvantage. DEIS grant funding and supports are applied equitably across all DEIS post-primary schools, irrespective of the patronage or governance model for a given school.</p>  <p>  DEIS supports are targeted at supporting the educational outcomes of those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage, and are not intended to cover the day to day costs of the school as is the case with capitation funding.</p>  <p>  With regards to the funding arrangements for the day to day running of post primary schools, these arrangements reflect the sectoral division of the second-level system.  Funding provided to schools in the ETB, Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sectors is primarily based on budgets determined by my Department. Voluntary Secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme are funded by way of per capita grants. At the core of these arrangements is reliance upon capitation as a key determinant of funding and enrolments are the main driver in the level of funding provided.  </p>  <p>  There are historical arrangements in place whereby the Capitation Grant funding for Voluntary Secondary Schools is reduced by the School Salary grant. This deduction amounted to &euro;563 per teaching post.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to &euro;21m has been provided in equalisation funding in the period up to 2009. Furthermore, as agreed with the Joint Managerial Body (JMB),  future improvements in equalisation funding is to be directed in the first instance at the elimination of the School Salary grant deduction from the capitation payable to Voluntary Secondary Schools.  Therefore, Budget 2020 provided additional funding to cater for a 20% reduction in the School Salary Grant deduction from 1 September 2020. This brought the deduction down from &euro;563 to &euro;450.40 per whole-time equivalent teaching post.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to have secured further funding in Budget 2022 to complete the elimination of this deduction. This means that all of the Voluntary Secondary Schools in the Free Education Scheme will see capitation funding increase resulting in an estimated additional &euro;1.4 million being made available to these schools in 2022 and &euro;5.7 million in 2023.</p></reply>

Choices regarding educational materials, textbooks and other educational products as well as digital and online services are made by individual schools and their boards of management, not by my Department.</p>  <p>  Access to Relationships and Sexuality Education, or RSE, is an important right for students. This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. Topics covered at post-primary include: sexual harassment; healthy and unhealthy relationships; consent; domestic gender-based and sexual violence; dating violence and rape.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the development of inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and SPHE across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships.</p>  <p>  Following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised recently as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationships, how to interact safely and respectfully the influence of the media on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.   A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow afterwards.</p>  <p>  I have announced a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and procedures on bullying.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment.</p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Justice in formulating and implementing the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV). Proposed actions for my Department include enhancing understanding of gender and relationships, and enabling frontline professionals and support staff, with the assistance of the support services for teachers, to have the necessary analysis, skills, and expertise to identify potential DSGBV dangers and make appropriate preventative interventions. As well as being done through developing and implementing update SPHE and RSE curricula, it will also be achieved by building on continuing professional development (CPD) and anti-bullying procedures.</p>  <p>  The proposed actions are intended to reflect the ambition of my Department to play its part in realising the aim of eradicating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from society and I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice in furtherance of this.</p></reply>

It provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him/her to create and maintain supportive relationships and become an active and responsible citizen in society. Through an SPHE programme that is planned and consistent throughout the school, children can develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions both now and in the future. As children progress through an SPHE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues. These will include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination. The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary.</p>  <p>  The SPHE Curriculum is divided into three strands Myself, Myself and Others, Myself and the Wider World at all levels, where topics are dealt with in an age and stage appropriate manner. From third class, under the area of &lsquo;Myself&rsquo;, through the strand unit &lsquo;Taking Care of My Body&rsquo;, children should be enabled to understand and appreciate what it means </p>  <p>  - to be healthy and to have a balanced lifestyle,</p>  <p>  - to realise that each individual has some responsibility for his/her health and that this responsibility increases as he/she gets older </p>  <p>  - to be aware of the dangers in using tobacco or alcohol and explore the reasons why people may choose to smoke or drink </p>  <p>  -to distinguish between legal and illegal substances, identifying those that are most commonly used, and examine and understand the effects they can have alcohol,</p>  <p>  - explore some of the reasons why people smoke, drink alcohol, misuse any kind of substances or take drugs that have no medical use.</p>  <p>  - The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools. The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.</p>  <p>  - The primary curriculum is currently undergoing a period of review and redevelopment, lead by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). There are calls for the primary curriculum to do more. To include new areas of learning such as: Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics, coding and computational thinking, and modern foreign languages, and more time for existing areas such as wellbeing (including SPHE and PE). In February 2020 the NCCA published the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework for public consultation. The impact of COVID-19 required changes to the consultation timeline, with a revised two-phased approach which was completed by the end of February 2022. It is intended that the finalised document will be sent from NCCA to the Minister for approval in early 2023 with publication by end Q1 2023. This framework will then guide the NCCA&rsquo;s work in developing a specification for each curriculum area. It will be the 2025/26 school year before these are introduced to schools</p>  <p>  -Other programmes, such as the Garda Schools Programme deal with issues relating to substance misuse, including alcohol. This is a joint Department of Education and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiative which commenced in 1991. Specially trained Garda&iacute; in each Garda Division are tasked with the implementation of the Programme. The programme is currently being updated and will be relaunched at the start of the next school year. The current primary and post-primary Garda Schools Programme provides lessons on the following topics:</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - Role, Uniform and Equipment</p>  <p>  - Vandalism</p>  <p>  - Personal Safety &ndash; including substance misuse</p>  <p>  - Road Safety</p>  <p>  - Cycle Safety</p>  <p>  - Respectful online Communication (Primary School)</p>  <p>  - Connect with Respect (post-primary School)</p>  <p>  More information can be found on www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-engagement/community-engagement-offices/garda-schools-programme-office.html.</p></reply>

As students&rsquo; progress through an SPHE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues. These include substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with a range of difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling. </p>  <p>  This is mainly done through the SPHE programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle. It also forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning for the new junior cycle which was introduced in September 2017. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p>  <p>  Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is developed.</p>  <p>  The SPHE curriculum is currently being redeveloped across all levels. A draft revised Junior Cycle specification has recently been approved by NCCA Council, with a public consultation to follow, running from July to October. It is expected that the finalised specification will be presented to Council for approval early 2023, and subject to my approval, will be implemented in schools in September 2023.</p>  <p>  Work in preparing a background paper that will inform the updating of senior cycle SPHE/RSE is underway. This paper will be finalised and presented to Council for approval for consultation in September 2022. It is intended that the curriculum redevelopment work will commence in September 2022 and a draft updated specification for senior cycle SPHE will be ready for public consultation by summer 2023 and finalised in early 2024 for implementation in schools in September 2024.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group which is due to commence development on updated primary specifications in Quarter 4 2022, with a draft estimated to be available for public consultation in Quarter 1 2024.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs. </p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools.</p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process.</p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes:</p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation);</p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ;</p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term.</p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs. </p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools.</p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process.</p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes:</p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation);</p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ;</p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term.</p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and it has set out a recommended approach for Government.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and I am  consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system with meetings scheduled over the coming weeks.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will also be considered as part of these deliberations. </p>  <p>  Once we have considered all of these matters in detail and taken on board the views of my Ministerial colleagues, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government.

It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  The majority of those who qualify for Household Benefits do so as a result of being awarded a primary qualifying payment.  When a primary qualifying payment for HHB is awarded to a customer, the award letter which issues advises of their possible entitlement to HHB.  For those who may qualify for HHB without being in receipt of a qualifying payment, information is widely available online, and in offices, to assist customers to find out about their possible entitlements.  For example, the gov.ie or Citizens Information websites are a great source of information in relation to social welfare entitlements.  Also, for those who do not have access to information online, there is a broad network of Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and Citizens Information Centres around the country where people can enquire about their entitlements.</p>  <p>  In relation to backdating of Household Benefits applications, payments can be backdated for up to 6 months where an entitlement existed, and further where there are extenuating circumstances.  It is open to customers to make an application for backdating of their entitlement and each case will be considered on its own merits.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,034,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p><p>There is no provision in place within the Free Travel scheme that allows a free travel pass for a minor under 18 years of age whose full-time carer is in receipt of a travel pass. A free travel pass is only awarded to those aged under 18 when a child aged 16 or over qualifies for a disability allowance payment or when a child is registered as blind. </p><p>While my Department does not provide a free travel pass to children aged under 18 in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, my Department does provide additional support in the form of the Domiciliary Care Allowance.  The Domiciliary Care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child aged under 16 with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs. </p><p>Support is also available under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA).  A travel supplement may be awarded in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all children under 18 whose full-time carer is in receipt of a travel pass, significant extra funding would be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <b></b></p></reply>

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single additional needs payments. </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Under the SWA scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  An Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time.  Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p><p>My Department is currently running a major awareness campaign which includes national radio adverts to promote and raise awareness of the Additional Needs Payment.  This support is available to anybody on a low income who is experiencing financial hardship regardless of the number of hours they work per week.  Anyone who needs support should contact the Department either through their local Intreo or Branch Office or by phoning 0818 60 70 80.  Further details on the Additional Needs Payment are available online at: www.gov.ie/en/service/4eb45-additional-needs-payment/.</p><p>The Department is also developing more extensive statistics in relation to the number of applications made to the ENP/UNP schemes. The focus of the development has been on current data from January 2022 with details on the number of applications available from this date onward. </p><p>While information on SWA schemes by Intreo Centre is not collated, it can be provided by county. </p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic Supplementary, Other Supplement and ENP/UNP applications received by county to-date for 2022 (to end of May) </p><p>Table 2 shows the number of Rent Supplement Recipients by County at the end of each month to-date for 2022 (end of May).

Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports, including airports.   </p>  <p>  Tusla has a significant role, as part of the State&rsquo;s overall response, to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland.

In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends.

It is most often used to declare an intention to change one&rsquo;s name. There is no legal requirement to instruct a solicitor or attend the High Court to execute a deed poll and a person is not required to lodge (or &lsquo;enrol&rsquo;) the document in the Central Office of the High Court.</p>  <p>  In order to execute a deed poll, the person declares to have given up a former name and adopted a new name for all purposes. The deed must be printed on Deed Paper (which is available from legal stationers), signed in the former name and the new name and in the presence of a witness.</p>  <p>  A copy of the deed poll and the affidavit of attesting witness can then be used with the person's birth certificate as evidence of change of name.</p>  <p>  Other than a minimal fee for swearing the affidavit before the solicitor or commissioner for oaths, there is no further fee involved.</p>  <p>  A deed poll enrolled in the Central Office of the High Court has no greater effect than a deed poll which has not been enrolled. The enrolment of a deed poll in the Central Office is a facility which the Registrar of the Central Office Court provides according to custom and practice so that a person may place their change of name on a publicly accessible record.

The Court stated that if the law in this area is to be changed, it would have to be done by way of legislation, rather than by an evolution in the case-law. </p>  <p>  A personal injury action may be brought by an injured person, or a wrongful death action may be brought under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 by his or her dependents after his or her death, but it is not possible for both of these actions to be brought arising from the same wrongful act.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, these issues, including issues relating to legislation, are under ongoing examination within my Department.

This law for the first time criminalises the sharing of intimate images without consent, regardless of the motivation for doing so. People convicted of this offence can face penalties of an unlimited fine and/or up to 7 years imprisonment. </p>  <p>  To make it easier for victims to report and have this illegal content removed, my Department, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, established a partnership with Hotline.ie to create an online reporting facility for intimate images shared without consent. This enables victims of intimate image abuse (IIA) to report it to Hotline.ie and request the assistance of Hotline.ie who will engage with the relevant service provider to seek the removal of the illegal content reported. At the same time, if a victim requests, Hotline.ie will pass all relevant information to the Garda&iacute; so that a thorough criminal investigation can be conducted with a view to prosecuting offenders. It is of course open to a victim to report directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they choose.</p>  <p>  While there is presently no specific legislation in this jurisdiction compelling service providers to report illicit content, I am informed by the Garda authorities that many do so voluntarily, particularly service providers with headquarters in the United States of America who report via the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) based in Washington. However, there are also certain service providers who do not engage with and do not respond to law enforcement requests.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s new proposal, published last month, on tackling child sexual abuse online.  This draft Regulation sets out comprehensive new requirements on online companies to assess and mitigate the extent to which their platforms are being misused for the purposes of child sexual abuse, both in terms of hosting material and the exploitation by abusers of their services for the purposes of grooming children.  The Regulation will introduce provisions requiring companies to detect and report such material.  It will also create a new EU Centre to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies across the Union in tackling online child sexual abuse.  I expressed my strong support for this new proposal to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, at the recent WeProtect Global Alliance summit on child sexual abuse in Brussels.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works in close cooperation with other international police services and agencies in the prevention and detection of illegal content online, where those activities identify suspects based in Ireland. Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working with Internet Service Providers to examine and put in place operational URL blocking initiatives.  Once operational, it is envisioned that these initiatives will deter potential offenders from accessing child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy maybe aware, Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the "Lanzarote Convention") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021. Part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is important to acknowledge the work of my colleague, Minister Catherine Martin, T.D., who has recently published and initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The Bill will establish a Media Commission to replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and provide for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner who will oversee the establishment of a regulatory framework for online safety.</p>  <p>  Under the framework, the Online Safety Commissioner will devise online safety codes requiring certain designated online services to operate appropriate systems and processes to minimise the availability of some of the most serious forms of harmful online content. Such content will include certain criminal material, including a number of relevant offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. It has also been agreed between my Department and Minister Martin's Department that the Media Commission will have a role in respect of certain regulatory functions arising from the EU Terrorist Content Online Regulation.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p>  <p>  Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 24 June, 45,882 eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes applications payments made in Section 38 organisations, many of whom have also completed payment. </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);#</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-29a.504.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062900083#WRK01000"><p>The HSE provides a wide range of medical and surgical aids and appliances, including prosthetics, free of charge to eligible persons (such as medical card holders and people on the Long-Term Illness scheme) following assessment by a relevant health professional. These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community.</p>  <p>  Amputees, whose amputation arose from either a traumatic or elective event, usually have their primary prosthesis fitted at the hospital where the surgery was undertaken. Subsequent prostheses are provided to eligible patients through the Community Funded Schemes. Rehabilitation services are provided by the National Rehabilitation Hospital primarily at their site in Dun Laoghaire and augmented by a number of satellite clinics that they operate throughout the country. There are also a number of smaller services operated at regional level that provide assessment and fitting clinics along with prostheses at a local level.</p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. . All persons 'ordinarily resident&rsquo; in the Republic of Ireland who are diagnosed with at least one of the listed illnesses are entitled to apply. There is no means test for the LTI scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's second query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p></reply>

There is no longer a public health rationale or need for extensive testing, case finding and tracing of infection to reduce COVID-19 transmission. The focus now is on mitigation of the severe impacts of COVID-19 for those most vulnerable to the disease and those with risk factors who may benefit from specific interventions. Full details of the current public health advice are available on the website of the HSE at www.hse.ie. The public health advice relating to testing and tracing is kept under continuing review having regard to the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the disease on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidance and other international evidence and guidance.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to implement this advice which is invariably leading to consolidation of resources around the country as the HSE moves through the transition phases of the programme. The arrangements with regard to the number of positions available, and the nature of the work that will be carried out is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in this regard, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value adding in the project. </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit, while also building more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. The scheme is aimed at supporting industry led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material and at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets. The scheme will be proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  The scheme received State Aid clearance on the basis that it provides supports to SMEs only.  This is consistent with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines which require consistency with the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation, which in turn restricts grant aid to the processing sector to SMEs only. </p></reply>

The EU budget agreement in 2020 provided a total CAP funding for Ireland of &euro;7.53 billion over the five-year period from 2023 to 2027. This funding is split between Pillar I (Direct Payments and Sectoral Interventions - &euro;5.97 billion) and Pillar II (Rural Development - &euro;1.56 billion).</p>  <p>  Article 91(4) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council states that the minimum EAFRD contribution rate shall be 20% of the total Pillar II expenditure. </p>  <p>  The allocation from the national exchequer to co-fund the Rural Development element of the CSP was agreed between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, at &euro;2.30 billion. This funding includes carbon tax funding of &euro;723 million.  This will bring the total budget for the rural development aspects to &euro;3.86 billion, with an effective national co-financing rate of 60%.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant increase in Pillar II funding from a number of perspectives. For example, on a five-year comparison, it is &euro;600 million higher than the &euro;3.26 billion initially allocated for the final five years, 2016-2020, of the previous Rural Development Programme, and more than &euro;900 million higher than the actual spend over that period.

This process involves a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant scientific data and a rigorous peer review process led by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).</p>  <p>  When this process is completed, the European Commission will draft a proposal for voting on at the EU Standing Committee dealing with pesticides legislation. It is now anticipated that this vote may take place towards the end of 2023. The Commission is expected to seek an extension of the current EU approval period, which is due to expire on 15th December 2022, since EFSA recently announced that it would be at least July 2023 before they are able to finalise their scientific conclusions for glyphosate.</p>  <p>  Uses against invasive species are being considered as part of the EU decision-making process for glyphosate. I am, of course, very conscious of the need to control invasive plants, such as Japanese knotweed, and I am aware that glyphosate products can play an important role in controlling such plants. These product must be used safely, without unacceptable impacts on human health and the environment. This must always be the foremost concern. The Department will finalise its position on glyphosate based on EFSA&rsquo;s and ECHA&rsquo;s scientific opinions and conclusions, as it does for all pesticide substance while remaining cognisant of the importance of this product to the farming sector. </p></reply>

In 2017, my Department expressed interest in providing financial support to WOAH activities and initiatives on animal welfare under the framework of the WOAH Platform in the following areas: (a) slaughter of animals in the regions of Eastern Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa, and (b) long-distance transport, including &ldquo;whole journey scenario&rdquo; by land and/or sea in inter-regional journeys.</p>  <p>  The original agreement was for a four-year period, commencing in 2017. However, the programme was disrupted by Covid-19 and the WOAH requested that unspent funds allocated to the project be spent on completing the originally planned work programme. My Department agreed to this reasonable proposal. </p>  <p>  Three instalments of &euro;75,000 each were paid in the final quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019. It is expected that the fourth and final instalment of &euro;75,000 will be paid in 2023. The funding for this project is in addition to the annual membership fee of &euro;133,845 which my Department pays to WOAH.</p>  <p>  This funding illustrates my Department's commitment to animal health and welfare, supporting the work of the WOAH on these issues internationally.</p></reply>

The Government has designed a package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased energy prices on all households, both rural and urban.</p><p>The package of measures includes:</p><p>- an energy credit of &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households;</p><p>- a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance paid  to 390,000 recipients;</p><p>- an additional lump sum payment of &euro;100 paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance;</p><p>- a temporary reduction in public transport fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead, Luas, DART and Local Link services;</p><p>- a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80 benefitting just over 70,000 families;</p><p>- the working family payment budget increase was brought forward from 1 June to 1 April; and</p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children.</p><p>From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective, I launched Our Rural Future, a national Rural Development Policy for 2021-2025 last year with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, and Minister Eamon Ryan. </p><p>The policy provides a blueprint for the sustainable development and investment in rural Ireland over the five years from 2021 to 2025. It outlines a vision for a thriving rural Ireland that is integral to our national economic, social, environmental and cultural wellbeing, which is built on the interdependence of urban and rural areas, and which recognises the centrality of people, the importance of vibrant and lived-in rural places, and the potential to create quality jobs and sustain our shared environment.</p><p>My Department continues to support communities in rural Ireland and in 2021 over &euro;344 million was invested. Included in this support is the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which has provided &euro;278 million to projects in rural Ireland since its inception.</p><p>Under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, almost &euro;113 million has been approved for more than 1,400 projects across the country since 2016. A New Building Acquisition Measure under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme providing &euro;400,000 per Local Authority has also been introduced this year. The LEADER Programme provided support to 867 projects to the value of over &euro;43 million in 2021. The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme also provided almost &euro;19 million to support 273 projects last year.</p><p>A new &euro;15 million Community Centre Investment Fund has been announced this year and I have increased Local Improvement Scheme funding to &euro;11 million. This brings investment in rural Ireland under the scheme to &euro;90 million since 2017.</p><p>My Department will continue to support communities in rural Ireland throughout 2022 and beyond through a range of schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Cl&aacute;r Programme, the Local Improvement Scheme, the Community Centre Capital Fund, the LEADER Transitional Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and the Community Services Programme.</p></reply>

Successful projects under these schemes are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p>  <p>  On 21 February , I announced the 2022 Connected Hubs Call. The aim of this fund is to add additional capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in Ireland by upgrading established hubs and Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). </p>  <p>  Eligible works included the expansion of hubs, installation of privacy booths, access control and security systems, the conversion of existing open plan space to modular offices, and the provision of enhanced audio visual, networking and conferencing facilities. </p>  <p>  By the deadline of 4 April, my Department had received 189 applications requesting over &euro;11m in funding. This represents a very high level of interest, and on 8 June, I announced &euro;5.1 million in funding to 81 successful applicants. </p>  <p>  All applications were subject to a uniform assessment and selection process. This process was centred on a competitive scoring system in line with a number of criteria which were publicised in advance of applications being developed and received. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific hub referenced by the Deputy, the application met the qualifying standard and was assessed and scored competitively along with all other applications. As the Call was significantly over subscribed this year, it was not possible to offer funding to all qualifying applications. Unfortunately, this application was not one of the 81 projects to succeed this year based on the competitive scoring process.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that all unsuccessful applicants can request feedback from my department by contacting the Connected Hubs team. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I would like to clarify that an unsuccessful application this year will not negatively impact on any future applications to the Connected Hubs Fund.</p></reply>
