I attended the G7 meeting in London in the context of my role as President of the Eurogroup, and I do not speak on EU taxation matters in my role as President of the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup is an informal body where the ministers of the euro area member states discuss matters relating to their shared responsibilities related to the euro.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance for Ireland, I represent Ireland&rsquo;s views at EU meetings where taxation is discussed. These meetings take place in a format where all EU Member States participate, known as ECOFIN, where the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union chairs the meetings. The Presidency is currently held by Portugal; from 1 July 2021 Slovenia will take over.</p>  <p>  As part of Council discussions late last year, all member states agreed to await the results of an OECD discussion on a global solution are available, but also maintained the commitment that the EU should act alone, in case no agreement is reached in the OECD.</p>  <p>  The G7 communique is an important signpost towards an agreement but it is also important to remember that there are 139 countries in the OECD's Inclusive Framework on BEPS who are the decision making body. An agreement will be a compromise reached through consensus, and will need to meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to achieve an ambitious agreement at the OECD discussions on the international tax architecture to provide the necessary certainty and stability.</p>  <p>  The minimum rate is a sensitive one for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  I believe that any agreement must be able to accommodate healthy and fair tax competition. At the same time I strongly believe in the need for robust boundaries to guard against aggressive tax planning.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that a threshold will apply to the minimum effective tax rate.  The threshold proposed for Pillar 2 is &euro;750m annual global turnover.  Thus, the vast majority of businesses in Ireland will not be subject to these new rules.  It is also relevant that subsidiaries of US multinationals are already subject to a similar regime in the US known as GILTI which is expected to coexist with Pillar 2.</p>  <p>  There will be further talks in late June and early July on an inclusive international agreement, and there is a lot to play out. I have said for some time that change is coming and we will adapt to this change as we have done before. Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment with an attractive tax rate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500060#WRB01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 338 together.</p>  <p>  Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>  The objective of scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.4 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;565 million have been granted to 49,800 employers in respect of 579,400 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.</p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. There are no changes in respect of the qualification criteria for EWSS eligibility for the childcare sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter.  Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.  As such, no decisions have yet been taken on any changes to the scheme for Q4 2021.</p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. This possible change is being signalled now to provide sufficient notice to businesses in respect of same.  Such a move, if it were to be introduced, could have the effect of testing the viability of businesses to the extent that they would be required to make a contribution against the background of a reduced overall subsidy from the State under the EWSS.  As with all firms that will benefit from the scheme in the months ahead, businesses in the childcare sector would be subject to the impact of this potential change.</p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is not yet possible to confirm Ireland&rsquo;s net contribution to the EU Budget in 2021 or for the remainder of the 2021-2027 MFF. However, my Department estimates that our receipts from the 2021-2027 MFF will be in the region of approximately &euro;2 billion each year. </p>  <p>  Looking at EU Budget contributions in net terms fails to capture the wider benefits to Ireland of our membership of the European Union. For example, the European Commission has previously estimated the benefits to Ireland of the Single Market at over &euro;30 billion and close to 10% of GNI. Although Ireland is a net contributor to the EU budget, many sectors of Irish society continue to benefit directly and indirectly from the breadth of EU programmes funded by the budget, including the Common Agricultural Policy, Regional Development, Horizon 2020, Erasmus and the PEACE Plus programme. The current MFF will also help support the member states and sectors most affected by Brexit through the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, from which Ireland is set to be a significant beneficiary.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500060#WRB01900"><p>The 2012 inter-Departmental Group which considered the structures and modalities of a property tax recommended that liability to the Local Property Tax (LPT) should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions. Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  </p>  <p>  At present, Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and where certain conditions under different categories including, 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and also to 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person' are met. In most cases the property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person. The current income thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple. Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.</p>  <p>  The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum and the duration of the relief normally coincides with the valuation period (1 May 2013 to 31 October 2021).</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021 which the Government recently approved provides that, from the next valuation date, the deferral thresholds will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple. As well as being recommended by the 2019 inter-Departmental Review of LPT this approach was endorsed by the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee in its September 2019 Scrutiny Report on the 2019 Review. In addition, the rate of interest charged on deferred LPT liabilities will be reduced from 4% to 3% annually. </p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, they can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options Throughout the pandemic, Revenue has engaged extensively with individual taxpayers experiencing financial difficulties due to the pandemic to agree flexible arrangements that best suit their circumstances, including in respect of LPT liabilities and will continue to fully engage with taxpayers facing financial difficulties.</p></reply>

In this regard, I welcome the adoption of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines, which came into force on 24 April.  This is a key achievement in the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda that was realised several months ahead of schedule.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  Of note is that a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the judiciary. Therefore, the Guidelines should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.  I have previously set out my view that these costs rather than the profit component tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such it is important that they are lowered.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the benefits accruing from reduced award levels, my expectation is that insurers will live up to commitments made, and will now commence reflecting savings to consumers, businesses and other groups.  In this regard, I recently met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectations in this regard and hear how they will respond to these recent developments.  These engagements were positive and I will meet with them again later this year to review progress.  </p>  <p>  While I continue to believe that this engagement is key to holding insurers to account, I have also asked officials in the Department to engage with the Central Bank to consider what enhancements could be made to improve transparency further through the National Claims Information Database so that the impact of the Guidelines can be seen in future motor, employer and public liability reports.  Technical work is commencing on this and I hope to return to the House later this year with proposals.</p></reply>

As with investment funds generally, tax occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the fund.  Additionally, in the case of both Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) and Real Estate Investment Trust companies (REITs), withholding taxes apply on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.  </p>  <p>  The operation of such investment structures is kept under review and in recent Finance Acts, I have made significant changes where concerns have been identified, to ensure that appropriate tax is collected.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, officials in my Department produced a report on REITs and IREFs as respects their investment in the Irish property market.  The report provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019. </p>  <p>  In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units.</p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property.</p>  <p>  Institutional investment in commercial and residential property is critically important to generating additional supply of property in Ireland through forward-funding of development projects, particularly in the area of high-density urban developments such as apartment buildings. Rebuilding Ireland identified the encouragement of the build-to-rent sector as a key factor in improving the rental sector and acknowledged that institutional investors have the potential to provide significant investment in such projects. </p>  <p>  However, I do not support the bulk purchase of residential houses by institutional investors.  This is why, in light of recent concerns raised, I have introduced a new 10% rate of Stamp Duty on such purchases, increased from the rates paid by other purchasers of 1% on values up to &euro;1 million and 2% on values above &euro;1 million.</p></reply>

The scheme gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis. One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties. By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. In accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Government, HTB was enhanced in July 2020. </p>  <p>  The future of the scheme, beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2021, is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2022 and the subsequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.50.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500061#WRC02500"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is referring to life insurance, including mortgage protection insurance. It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  While the above applies in general, I am aware of reports that some customers, including those with Type 1 diabetes, have experienced increased difficulties in obtaining life insurance or mortgage protection cover in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and my officials have raised in meetings with Insurance Ireland, and more recently with the CEOs of the main insurers in the Irish market.   Insurance Ireland stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19.  It will continue to keep in close contact with its members on this issue, which I welcome. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19, we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  </p>  <p>Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie   or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

In Budget 2021, a record total of &euro;3.3 billion was allocated towards housing, including an Exchequer allocation of &euro;3.1 billion. The capital spending on housing for 2021 is 26 per cent higher than the previous year, and almost two-and a half times what it was in 2017, demonstrating the massive commitments Government has already made in the area of housing.</p>  <p>  There are also significant non-fiscal constraints to achieving the desired level of output &ndash; a pandemic, labour shortages and material shortages. There are also skills shortages, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades as announced last week in the Economic Recovery Plan. </p>  <p>  The funding landscape for residential development remains challenging particularly outside the main urban areas and commuter belt where demand is less proven. Even within the main urban centres the availability of finance very much depends on the entity, their track record and their previous relationship with banks or alternative lenders. While there has been an increase in the funding options in the market over the last number of years, the onset of the global pandemic interrupted this trend. More recently, the announcement of some lenders exiting the Irish market has created further funding gaps. </p>  <p>  To address these ongoing gaps, Home Building Finance Ireland has expanded its product offering to cater for schemes from 5 to 300 units across Ireland. It has also adopted a regional focus with a view to targeting those developers and regions where the availability of funding is even more limited. </p>  <p>  Irish banks remain well capitalised and all funding metrics are substantially above minimum requirements which means they remain in a strong position to lend. Financial performance in Q1 2021 was positive across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding with stable loan volumes, no deterioration in asset quality and strong liquidity positions. Mortgage drawdowns for house purchase grew by 5% yoy in Q1 despite the public health restrictions that were in place. Despite the significant losses booked in 2020, the funding and capital positions of the banks remain significantly above regulatory minima leaving them well positioned to manage through the crisis and to support the recovering economy.</p></reply>

In the last few months, we have seen several major announcements including the withdrawal of Ulster Bank, the potential withdrawal of KBC Bank Ireland, and the forthcoming closure of a large number of bank branches by Bank of Ireland and a smaller number by AIB. </font></p><p><font color="#001A26">I appreciate the concerns of bank staff arising from these announcements and for the future direction of the sector they work in.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">While many ascribe these announcements wholly or partially to Covid and all the challenges that the pandemic has brought, the reality is that retail financial services is undergoing real change as the sector copes with long running challenges such as negative interest rates, technological change that is reducing the barriers to entry to a whole range of new entrants, and changing customer preferences as they use more and more digital services, while still wanting the traditional branch network to be available. </font></p><p><font color="#001A26">Accordingly, I am considering how next to structure a review process that will examine the issues in depth. This process is likely to involve engagement with a wide range of stakeholders in developing a fuller analysis of future banking challenges and recommendations that flow from that analysis.  I want to ensure that the process is a holistic one as it is important that the future of banking is not determined by the incumbents.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">I hope to be in a position to set out details on this in the coming months and all stakeholders will be afforded the appropriate opportunities to contribute their views and suggestions.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.72.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500061#WRC04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 89, 93, 103, 108, 116, 128, 366 to 369, inclusive, 395 and 398 together.</p>  <p>  The Government has noted the communique of 5 June from the G7 Finance Ministers which includes the desire for a global minimum effective tax rate of at least 15%. The G7 agreement is an important signpost towards an agreement but it is relevant also that there are 139 countries participating in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS which is the formal decision body for any agreement. Any agreement will be a compromise and will need to be a consensus, and it must meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing.</p>  <p>  Firstly, it is important to stress that the Government believes that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to achieve a sustainable, ambitious and equitable agreement on modernising the framework for international tax to reflect increasing globalisation and digitalisation. Secondly, it is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has been an ongoing process since 2013.</p>  <p>  In this respect, Ireland has very much played its part in reframing these rules for the benefit of business and citizens, and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with the new international norms. A lot has been achieved through the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS process and we now have far more robust international tax rules and safeguards to prevent abuse, arbitrage, base erosion and profit shifting than existed a decade ago.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, Ireland has constructively engaged in the more recent discussions to find a solution at the OECD to address the broader tax challenges of digitalisation and globalisation.  This is the subject of the current negotiations which are expected to conclude this year. The OECD is proposing a two pillar solution. Pillar 1 concerns the allocation of a proportion of taxing rights to the market jurisdiction, while Pillar 2 concerns a series of rules, the Income Inclusion Rule, the Under-Taxed Payment Rule and the Subject to Tax Rule which are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate for large multi-national enterprises.  It is important to note that the Pillar 2 proposals are broadly based on an existing US regime, GILTI, which applies to US multinationals in Ireland may already subject them to a top up tax in the US.   </p>  <p>  The minimum rate creates challenges for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  I believe that any agreement must be able to accommodate healthy and fair tax competition. Small countries, and Ireland is one of them, need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for advantages of scale, location, resources, industrial heritage and the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries.  At the same time, I fully accept that there needs to be clear boundaries to ensure any competition is fair and sustainable.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to continue to make a case for the agreement to accommodate Ireland&rsquo;s low but substantial 12.5% rate.</p>  <p>  There will be a meeting of 139 members of the Inclusive framework on 30 June and 1 July in order to try reaching a consensus agreement. Further technical work will continue over the summer and in the autumn with a view to achieving a comprehensive agreement in October in lines with the principles agreed.</p>  <p>  The Government has said for some time that change is coming and we will adapt to this change as we have done before. Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment. </p>  <p>  My Department previously estimated the annual cost to the Irish Exchequer of agreement of BEPS related measures could be between &euro;800 million and &euro;2 billion, depending on the design of the final agreement.  The starting point for the Department&rsquo;s estimate was a provisional jurisdiction-specific revenue modelling-tool circulated to each country bilaterally by the OECD. </p>  <p>  While this change could have a significant cost in reduced tax receipts, this is a price worth paying for the stability and tax certainty that will provide a robust international tax framework into the future.   We have seen the seen the escalating trade tensions brought about by the introduction of unilateral digital taxes.  It will benefit us all to avoid the risk of tit-for-tat sanctions negatively impacting the global trading environment.  As a small open economy the imposition of sanctions could result in a disproportionate negative impact to our trading environment. </p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome at the OECD, Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment.    Tax is not the only driver for multinational enterprises deciding to locate in Ireland, all of the building blocks that make Ireland an attractive place to invest will remain in place.   We will maintain a competitive tax rate, with a stable business trading environment, and a young, well educated, English speaking workforce.</p></reply>

An IREF is an investment fund, or a sub-fund, which derives 25% or more of its market value from Irish real estate.  </p><p>As an investment undertaking, the profits or gains of the IREF are not taxed within the fund, but instead are subject to tax in the hands of the investors, its unit holders. This avoids a double layer of taxation and facilitates collective investment.  IREFs operate a 20% IREF withholding tax (as opposed to Dividend Withholding Tax (&ldquo;DWT&rdquo;)) on distributions to non-resident investors, who may be entitled to a refund of some or all of any tax withheld under a double tax treaty.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of exceptions from the operation of IREF withholding tax such as for pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax, provided the appropriate declarations are in place. </p><p>Unit holders in an IREF are generally subject to 20% IREF withholding tax on the occurrence of an IREF taxable event. An IREF taxable event can broadly be defined as any way in which the value of the profits of the IREF are passed to the unit holder, e.g. by way of a relevant payment (which is akin to receiving a dividend), and the IREF taxable amount in broad terms is the profit element of that payment.  Information on the amount of the taxable amounts and associated IREF withholding tax deducted for various years (2017, 2018 &amp;amp; 2019) is published by Revenue in section 4.3 of &ldquo;Corporation Tax &ndash; 2020 Payments and 2019 Returns&rdquo;.[1]  </p><p>IREFs are obliged to electronically file financial statements with Revenue for each accounting period (under the Investment Undertaking Electronic Account Filing Requirements Regulations 2018 SI No. 368 of 2018). </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for information on tax withheld by an IREFs as a proportion of their pre-tax profits and operating profits, I am advised by Revenue that financial statements are presented in accordance with relevant accounting standards and any difference between pre-tax profits and operating profits would depend on an individual IREF&rsquo;s income, expenses, profits and gains and the applicable financial reporting standards. However, Revenue has advised that generally the difference between operating profits and pre-tax profits is finance costs. Finance Act 2019 amended the IREF regime to provide that IREFs with excessive deductions for financing costs are now regarded as having income subject to income tax.  For the three-month period to 31 December 2019, income tax of &euro;6.2m associated with excessive deductions for financing costs, was paid by the IREFs. </p><p>The Deputy has asked for a hypothetical effective tax rate calculated as the IREF tax as a proportion of profits.  However, such an effective tax rate would not reflect the effects of timing or the manner in which IREF tax is applied. As such, it could not be regarded as an accurate measure of an effective tax rate applicable to IREFs.  There are two key timing differences which such a measure would ignore.</p><p>The first is that IREF withholding tax applies to IREF taxable events &ndash; which generally speaking is the point at which the profits are passed from the IREF to the unit-holder.  The profits retained within the IREF, and not yet distributed to unit holders, will in the future be IREF taxable events and will be within the charge to IREF withholding tax at that point.</p><p>In addition, as IREFs hold real property, their operating profits and pre-tax profits will include revaluations of the property they hold.  Capital gains tax on gains on an investment property would only arise where the property is actually disposed of and any revaluation gains previously booked through the profit and loss account realised.</p><p>As such, it would not be appropriate to compare the rate of IREF withholding tax as a proportion of IREF profits (either operating profits or pre-tax profits) with either the rate of corporation tax or capital gains tax.  However, in Table 1 below, I have set out the profits of the IREFs, the IREF taxable amount for each year (being akin to the distributions made by the funds in those years) and the tax paid by the fund in those years.</p><p>Of note, Revenue has advised that the provision of the profit amounts disclosed in Table 1 come with a number of caveats: </p><p>Some of the figures contained in accounts are net figures &ndash; in this regard the income &amp;amp; losses, unrealised and realised losses and gains have been netted and therefore the figures should only be used for indicative purposes.</p><p>There can be inconsistency in the length of financial periods, with some in excess of 12 months. This was evident in 2017 filings and again last year where a number of the IREFs sought derogations from the Central Bank to prepare 18 months set of accounts for the 2019/2020 period due to impact of Covid-19. Therefore, instead of preparing financial statements to 31 December 2019, some IREFs have now prepared and filed 18-month accounts to 30 June 2020, which will form part of the 2020 filing figures. </p><p>Table 1: Profits, IREF taxable events and tax liabilities of IREFs</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Operating Profit per Financial Statements</td>       <td>912</td>       <td>868</td>       <td>1,159</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit Before Tax per Financial Statements</td>       <td>691</td>       <td>498</td>       <td>725</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF taxable amount</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>213</td>       <td>369</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF WHT</td>       <td>8.3</td>       <td>28.2</td>       <td>65.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Income tax</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>6.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total tax </td>       <td>8.3</td>       <td>28.2</td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tax as percentage of IREF taxable amount</td>       <td>18.44%</td>       <td>13.24%</td>       <td>19.51%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Proposed increased rate of IREF WHT and removal of exemptions from corporation tax and capital gains tax</p><p>The IREF withholding tax rate (20%) was not increased in Finance Act 2019 in line with the DWT rate (now 25%). I increased the rate of DWT to 25% to more accurately reflect the tax liability of Irish individuals who receive dividends from Irish companies.  IREF withholding tax, on the other hand, is targeted at non-residents, who may be entitled to a full or partial refund of any tax withheld under a double tax treaty.  The commonest rate to which IREF withholding tax can be reduced under such double tax treaties is 15%.</p><p>As the IREF withholding tax is levied on non-residents who may be entitled to a refund under a double tax treaty, it was not appropriate to increase the IREF withholding tax rate. </p><p>The reason that the IREF regime applies an exit tax, rather than an entity level tax, is because IREFs are collective investment vehicles.  Ireland&rsquo;s policy on collective investment vehicles, since 2000, has been to ensure that there is not two layers of taxation: one at the entity level and one at the unit holder level.  This is achieved by exempting certain regulated collective investment vehicles from taxation.  The IREF withholding tax is the alternative to an entity level taxation for a collective investment vehicle. </p><p>A number of anti-avoidance rules were brought forward in Finance Act 2019 to ensure that the IREF withholding tax was not being avoided, including both a debt cap and an income to interest ratio. </p><p>With regard to capital gains tax, when introduced in 2016, the IREF regime included a capital gains tax exemption in respect of property assets held for more than 5 years. However this exemption was removed in Finance Act 2017.  As a result, where IREF property assets are sold and the gains distributed to investors, IREF withholding tax at 20% applies on those gains. </p><p>The success of the 2019 targeted anti avoidance measures , in addition to Finance Act 2017&rsquo;s removal of the capital gains tax exemption, can be evidenced by the increased tax paid by IREFs as set out in Table 1.</p><p>Officials in my Department and Revenue continue to monitor the taxation of IREFs.</p></reply>

I also welcome Bank of Ireland's announcement of a partnership with An Post to ensure that counter services will still be available for its customers locally.</p>  <p>With regards to Ulster Bank and KBC, whilst the management of staff matters is entirely a matter for the Banks and any counterparty who acquires any of their business, I would expect all stakeholders to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff. This includes full compliance with any statutory requirements, and honouring all agreements in place between the bank and staff representative bodies.  In addition, I would expect these entities to engage with staff representative bodies as appropriate.  </p>  <p>By way of update, on Friday 11 June 2021 Ulster Bank announced that a new Colleague Agreement has been reached with the Financial Services Union (FSU) subject to a ballot of its members. The Deputy will be aware that I have met with representatives from both Ulster Bank and its parent company, NatWest in recent months. During these engagements, I have always strongly emphasised the importance of timely communication with staff, customers and other stakeholders in relation to strategic decisions regarding Ulster Bank. I also met with the Financial Services Union shortly after NatWest&rsquo;s announcement and I have committed to further engagement with them in relation to this issue. </p>  <p>  I note separately that PTSB and AIB have both mentioned in their recent Q1 trading statements that negotiations are continuing with NatWest in relation to the potential acquisition of parts of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>  <p>  In relation to KBC, officials from my Department met with representatives from KBC last month as part of the normal engagements with the banking sector.  In light of its recent announcement, KBC confirmed that work on negotiations are underway, as provided for in the Memorandum of Understanding with Bank of Ireland.   KBC emphasised that it is engaging with staff in relation to the announcement. </p>  <p>  I welcome the engagements which are taking place both between Nat West and AIB and PTSB and between KBC and Bank of Ireland, as well as the progress last week between Ulster Bank and the FSU. While these are commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for AIB, PTSB, and Bank of Ireland, as well as for the staff and customers of Ulster Bank and KBC and for the Irish economy generally.</p></reply>

This year so far we have seen several major announcements including the withdrawal of Ulster Bank by Nat West and the potential withdrawal of KBC Bank Ireland, the forthcoming closure of a large number of bank branches by Bank of Ireland and a smaller number by AIB. While these decisions are regrettable, I welcome the engagements which are taking place between Nat West and AIB and PTSB and between KBC Bank Ireland and Bank of Ireland with regard to the transfer of business.</p>  <p>  I note the news on  Friday 11 June 2021 that Ulster Bank has reached a new Colleague Agreement with the Financial Services Union (FSU) and that this agreement is subject to a ballot of FSU members. While these are commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for the banking sector, as well as for the staff and customers of Ulster Bank and KBC and for the Irish economy generally.</p>  <p>  The sector is facing a number of long running challenges such as negative interest rates, technological change that is reducing the barriers to entry to a whole range of new entrants, and changing customer preferences as they use more and more digital services, while still wanting the traditional branch network to be available.  Competing with online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector. Overall, this puts pressure on banks' profits, and, in turn, the attractiveness of the market. </p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated with retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending and new lending to SMEs. However, price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. Notwithstanding the recent announcements in the banking sector, Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions.  An Post also offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches and Bank of Ireland has recently announced that it is following suit. A number of non-banks have also expanded their offerings in the mortgage and SME sectors recently.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to ensure that the banking and financial system is one which will effectively contribute and support economic growth and employment. Sustainable and responsible competition in the retail financial sector is vital to ensuring that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit. </p>  <p>  As such, my Department is considering a review process that will look at the many issues in depth, provide sensible analysis and implementable recommendations and I hope to be in a position to set out greater details on this soon.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.91.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500062#WRD00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 125 together.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland, as part of its independent mandate to preserve and protect financial stability in Ireland, has statutory responsibility for the regulation of mortgage lending by banks and other regulated entities. </p>  <p>  In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macroprudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit driven house price spirals from developing. </p>  <p>  The mortgage measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. For example, the LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For first-time buyers (FTBs), the LTV limit is 90% of the value of the residential property and for second and subsequent buyers (SSBs) the LTV limit is 80%.  However, lenders also have a certain flexibility at their own discretion to provide a certain amount of mortgage lending in excess of these thresholds. </p>  <p>  While regulated lenders must comply with the various rules within the macroprudential and consumer protection frameworks, the extension of credit by lenders to potential customers (including a joint mortgage application) is ultimately a commercial decision for the lender themselves and each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies.</p>  <p>  Before providing a mortgage, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation.  In this context, lenders can and do take into account rental payments when making their affordability assessment as part of regular credit worthiness assessment and underwriting process. </p>  <p>  However it is also worth noting that a mortgage is the largest liability that most households will take on in their lifetime and that it comes with less flexibility than a rental contract, leaving borrowers more exposed to shocks to incomes, house prices and interest rates in the future. Therefore, the ability to make regular repayments &ndash; evidenced through rental payments &ndash; does not substitute for the protection for borrowers in having a down payment for the purchase of a residential property.  A mortgage deposit acts as a cushion of housing equity, and can help households to absorb house price falls without the borrower falling into negative equity. </p>  <p>  By way of additional information the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses including rent and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate and lenders must be satisfied that mortgages are affordable for borrowers for the duration of the life of a loan. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The clause&rsquo;s activation temporarily suspends the regular application of the EU fiscal rules, to allow Member States to take all necessary expenditure and taxation measures to combat the spread of the virus.</p>  <p>  While the activation of the GEC means the regular fiscal requirements have been temporarily suspended, it must be noted that the Pact itself has not been suspended or revoked but remains in place, providing an important anchor for fiscal policy over the medium-term. As part of the recent announcement by the European Commission of its 2021 Spring Package, the Commission confirmed that the General Escape Clause of the Pact will remain in force in 2022, and is expected to be de-activated in 2023.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Stability Programme Update (SPU), published by my Department in April, Ireland recorded a General Government deficit of 5 per cent of GDP in 2020. This figure reflects the extraordinary nature of the fiscal measures put in place to support Ireland&rsquo;s fight against the pandemic. Substantial additional expenditure has been allocated by Government to provide the necessary resources to our health service, and to support workers and businesses through the crisis with policies including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>  <p>  A multi-annual path for the public finances will be set out in the forthcoming Summer Economic Statement, including a medium-term fiscal target. This reflects the priority which the Government places on ensuring that the public finances return to broad balance over the medium-term as economic activity recovers, tax revenues increase and the exceptional policy measures taken to combat the pandemic are unwound.</p></reply>

There was simply too much epidemiological, economic and fiscal uncertainty in March to make policy decisions with significant budgetary implications.  Accordingly, the medium-term forecasts in the SPU were undertaken on a purely technical basis and do not incorporate any new policies.</p>  <p>  I note that the Council endorsed the SPU medium-term macroeconomic forecasts, and indeed view some potential upside to my Department&rsquo;s projections. More broadly, I welcome the Council&rsquo;s endorsement of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance. The Council agrees that the unprecedented level of budgetary support that Government has provided has been the appropriate response to the pandemic. The Council is of the view that, as the situation evolves, supports should be more precisely targeted and reduced in a gradual and responsible manner. This is precisely what the Government announced in the Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am in complete agreement with the Council that a credible medium term fiscal anchor is essential. Now that more certainty exists, the Government will set this out in the forthcoming Summer Economic Statement. </p></reply>

In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which are currently exempt from the LPT, into the taxation system. </p><p>Accordingly, the Government recently gave its approval for the General Scheme of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021 which has been published. The measures proposed for this Bill will fulfil the Programme for Government commitments in this area and will secure the future of the Local Property Tax.  Properties that were previously exempt or fell outside the tax will now be brought into scope.  </p><p>The Government has agreed that a modified version of scenario 5 of the 2019 Inter-Departmental Review of LPT should form the basis for the calculation of future LPT liabilities. As outlined in the 2019 Review, there are significant gains to progressivity from the adoption of a scenario 5 approach to a new method for liability calculation. The Review included a Distributional Impact Analysis using the ESRI SWITCH Model (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) tax and benefit micro-simulation model, which allow an assessment of how regressive or progressive the impact of the different policy scenarios would be for households.</p><p>It estimated that scenario 5 would result in average increases of 0.40 per cent to households&rsquo; equivalised disposable income as a result of the measures. There would be a broadly progressive trend, with households in the first two deciles gaining the most in relative terms at 0.46 per cent and 0.43 per cent respectively, while households in the top three income deciles experience below average gains of 0.37 per cent. The proposed approach provides for a  new valuation band 1 from &euro;0 to &euro;200,000, with an LPT charge fixed at the current  rates for bands 1 and 2,  of &euro;90 and &euro;225 respectively. This results in the vast majority of current band 1 properties remaining in the new band 1 and continuing to pay the same amount as presently.  The approach also provides for higher rates above &euro;1.05million and above &euro;1.75 million. Both of these measures are designed to further improve the progressivity of the tax. </p><p>The Government has decided to both cut the rate of the tax and widen the bands to make the changes affordable.  This means that the majority of homeowners are likely to see either a decrease or no change.  Where increases arise, the majority will be a single band (&euro;90), notwithstanding the significant increases we have seen in property values since 2013.  The overall structure of the tax, which is broadly understood and accepted, is being maintained.  </p><p>I look forward to publication in due course of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p></reply>

Ireland is expected to receive approximately &euro;915m in grants under the RRF for the period 2021-2022. A further set of grants is to be allocated in 2023.</p>  <p>  This builds on previous commitments to introduce a range of reform measures to continue efforts to tackle Aggressive Tax Planning, especially in relation to outbound payments. </p>  <p>  As signalled in the Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, which was published in January, we have committed to introduce a range of reform measures to continue efforts to tackle Aggressive Tax Planning.  </p>  <p>  In the draft recovery and resilience plan, from a tax perspective, commitments have been made to;</p>  <p>  Apply enhanced Controlled Foreign Company rules apply to the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Publish external independent economic research on the impact of recent legislative changes, both domestically and internationally, on outbound payments from Ireland.</p>  <p>  Carry out a Public Consultation on the introduction of measures to ensure that Outbound Payments do not avail of double non-taxation.</p>  <p>  Introduce legislation to safeguard against the possibility of double non-taxation in Finance Act 2023 at the latest. </p>  <p>  Further detail and context can be accessed in the Update to Ireland's Corporation Tax Roadmap.  The research and public consultation will be published on the Department of Finance website in due course.</p>  <p>  At this point it is not anticipated that there will be a significant impact on Exchequer receipts as the above measures are behavioural are not expected to result in a reduction or increase in tax receipts.  </p>  <p>  It should first be noted that the Department cannot comment on the specific tax affairs or any identified individual or company due to the obligation to protect taxpayer confidentiality as provided for by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. It is an offence for a Revenue official to directly or indirectly disclose taxpayer information to third parties, including the Minister for Finance, unless this is specifically provided for in legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department has pointed to the concentration risks associated with international tax proposals on many occasions. The Department&rsquo;s SPU estimates assume a &euro;2 billion revenue loss relative to baseline by 2025. </p>  <p>  The IFAC report considers a scenario whereby five stylised large, foreign-owned multinational enterprises exit Ireland, which amounts to a revenue exposure of &euro;3.25 billion. The corporation tax liability of these firms is based loosely on the average tax liability of the top multinationals in Ireland. This approach is obviously highly simplified and based on a number of very large assumptions but it appears that it is intended to be largely illustrative, rather than representing a projected outcome, which may reflect the fact that there is still a large degree of uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of reform efforts.</p></reply>

The scheme ended on 30 April.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 66,058 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 9 June 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;10,862,004, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,172,401, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   </p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.</p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme.  However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:</p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It was originally to apply until 31 December 2021. However, as I announced recently, the reduced rate will be extended to 1 September 2022. The extension until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) (extended to 31 December 2021) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond.</p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.</p>  <p>  The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme.</p></reply>

The G7 is committed to working together to ensure a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive recovery. The meeting also discussed key global challenges, including climate and nature; health finance; and support for lower income countries. A communiqu&eacute; outlining the outcomes of the G7 Finance Ministers&rsquo; deliberations over the previous few months was agreed at the meeting and published on 5th June.</p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with other participants including US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen; Japanese Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Taro Aso; Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland; as well as the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. I also met with the new Secretary General of the OECD, Mathias Cormann, who took up his new role on 1 June, and with the Managing Director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva.</p>  <p>  In relation to deliberations and agreements arising from the G7 Summit which are likely to impact on Ireland, deputies will be aware that the ongoing discussions on international tax framework were discussed. I have noted the Communique from the G7 Finance Ministers includes a reference to a minimum effective tax rate of 15%.</p>  <p>  The G7 communiqu&eacute; is an important signpost towards an agreement but it is relevant also that there are 139 countries in the OECD's Inclusive Framework on BEPS, and any agreement needs to meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing.</p></reply>

In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which are currently exempt from the LPT, into the taxation system. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Government has given its approval for the General Scheme of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021 which has been published. The Bill is being drafted to give effect to a package of measures addressing the Programme commitments and related matters. </p>  <p>  The measures proposed for this Bill will fulfil the Programme for Government commitments in this area and will secure the future of the Local Property Tax.  Properties that were previously exempt or falling outside the tax will now be brought into scope.  The Government has decided to both cut the rate of the tax and widen the bands to make the changes affordable.  This means that the majority of homeowners are likely to see either a decrease or no change.  Where increases arise, the majority will be a single band (&euro;90), notwithstanding the significant increases we have seen in property values since 2013.  The overall structure of the tax, which is broadly understood and accepted, is being maintained.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to publication in due course of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p></reply>

Following the Government meeting on 1 June, I announced a number of measures to provide certainty to businesses as public health restrictions are lifted and allow them to plan for the future as they re-open and resume normal trading. </p>  <p>  These measures include</p>  <p>  the extension of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to the end of 2021, </p>  <p>  the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme to the end of 2021 and its enhancement to provide additional support to businesses upon re-opening, </p>  <p>  a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021, </p>  <p>  the extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme, and </p>  <p>  the extension of the reduced rate of VAT of 9% applying on a temporary basis to Hospitality and Tourism related goods and services until 1 September 2022. </p>  <p>  An enhanced CRSS restart payment is being introduced for businesses availing of CRSS who can re-open from 2 June, they will be eligible to claim an enhanced restart payment of three weeks at double rate of payment paid in one &lsquo;restart week payment&rsquo; as they exit the scheme. The statutory maximum payment will be increased from &euro;5,000 per week to &euro;10,000 per week for this restart payment. This means that businesses opening from 2 June will receive a maximum of &euro;30,000 restart payment calculated with reference to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019. </p>  <p>  As the economy re-opens, a new general scheme the BRSS will be introduced, aimed at businesses which have had reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions.  Similar to CRSS it will apply to businesses registered with Revenue, whose profits are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, and their turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period ( 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021) compared with 2019.   Qualifying businesses will be able to apply to Revenue for a once-off cash payment, representing an advance credit for trading expenses that are deductible for income and/or corporation tax purposes.  The scheme will be implemented in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The extensions of the EWSS and CRSS, the tax debt warehousing enhancements and the new BRSS will apply across the economy and are not specific to any sector. However, the Government recognises the continuing challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, and have agreed that the reduced VAT rate of 9% applying to the sectors on a temporary basis will be extended to September 2022. The extension of the reduced rate until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess matters as we move forward with the reopening of the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic as far as possible.</p></reply>

As such, timely implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform is high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. This sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. </p>  <p>  I would like to note that significant progress has been made to date in this regard. This includes:</p>  <p>  The establishment of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance; </p>  <p>  The adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council; </p>  <p>  The creation of a public process on enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).</p>  <p>  Work is continuing to progress other key actions, such as reforming of the duty of care, strengthening the laws on perjury, enhancing the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), expanding the National Claims Information Database (NCID) with a view to  publish its first report on employer and public liability insurance, continuing to reform PIAB, and considering issues related to the Central Bank&rsquo;s upcoming report on differential pricing so that we can respond accordingly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on 24 April. These materially reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. As a result, a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. In addition to the lower awards and legal fees, the Guidelines will be used by both the judiciary and PIAB. Accordingly, they should help bring more certainty to claimants and insurers and reinforce the benefits of using PIAB, thereby further reducing the costs of claims. </p>  <p>Another key achievement of the reform agenda is the creation of the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market  . Since its establishment, the Office has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and other state regulators on the issues surrounding competition. Minister of State Fleming chairs meetings of the Office which has met on a number of occasions since its establishment and reports on a regular basis to the Cabinet Sub-Group on its progress.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan which will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

As such the Government cannot interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance, or direct as to what cover is provided on. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in this, as reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  Current Government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. Almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures is being invested over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, with an expectation that insurers will provide cover where this has occurred. A key pillar of Government policy is the  Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to the 18 completed flood defence schemes which should, in turn, provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. While there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, it is acknowledged that some households are still experiencing difficulties in areas with demountable flood defences. My officials are engaging with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.</p>  <p>Legislating for compulsory flood insurance was an option considered by my Department in its review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the &lsquo;Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report&rsquo;. It was found that such an approach would have limited impact on the availability of flood cover. More recently, in 2019 my Department published a discussion paper on flood insurance entitled &lsquo;Public Consultation on Climate Change and Insurance in the context of the &lsquo;Climate Action Plan 2019 to Tackle Climate Breakdown  &rsquo;. My Department is continuing to review the challenges of property insurance and flooding as part of the action points for my Department under the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will also continue to engage on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood insurance issues, and that every effort is being made to encourage a responsive approach from the insurance industry. </p></reply>

It is expected that there will be a limited number of such businesses and it is important that support is provided to these businesses.  This Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS) will be implemented in September 2021. </p><p>Businesses whose turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period (1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021) compared with 2019 will be eligible. The scheme will not be restricted by location, rate paying or physical premises. Businesses who previously availed of other schemes such as SBASC and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme for example as well as CRSS will be eligible to apply provided they meet the qualifying criteria. </p><p>The BRSS will be administered by Revenue and will operate in a similar way to CRSS. </p><p>It will apply to businesses registered with Revenue, whose profits are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, and their turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period.</p><p>The reference period will be 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 compared with turnover in 2019. This reference period should better target those businesses whose trade is still impacted even when restrictions are easing. </p><p>Qualifying businesses will be able to apply to Revenue for a once-off cash payment, representing an advance credit for trading expenses that is deductible for income and/or corporation tax purposes, similar to CRSS.</p><p>Payments will be calculated on the basis of 3 weeks at 10% of the first &euro;1m in turnover and 5% thereafter, based on average turnover for 2019, and will be subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000.</p><p>This means that the maximum payment under the scheme will be &euro;15,000. </p><p>Similar conditionality to CRSS and EWSS will apply including tax clearance, and payment will be conditional on the business trading or where the business cannot trade the business has the intention to trade.  I hope to bring legislative proposals into the D&aacute;il before the summer recess to give effect to this scheme.</p></reply>

It is important to acknowledge the role played by innovative sectors of the economy. The growing digitalisation of business in recent years has allowed many parts of the economy to continue to function while others were forced to close. This has enabled home working and allowed trade in essential goods and services to continue.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the fact that sectors of the economy have continued to function has allowed Governments to extend supports to other sectors of the economy who have fared less well particularly in areas such as hospitality and retail.  Most importantly, we should acknowledge the remarkable work of the pharmaceutical sector in rapidly developing vaccines which I believe will be key to allow us to return to our normal lives as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>Countries will need to repair public finances once we have emerged from the pandemic. This will require us to be open to ideas and Ireland will give careful consideration to any proposals which may be helpful. However, I am of the opinion that innovation needs to be encouraged, and I remain to be convinced on taxes which target specific innovative sectors.</p></reply>

The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence.</p>  <p>  Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year.

This new stamp duty rate replaces the pre-existing stamp duty rates for residential property, which are 1% for the first &euro;1 million in consideration and 2% on amounts above &euro;1 million (on a per-property basis).</p><p>In brief the new measure has the following effect.</p><p>The charge applies to bulk purchasers, being a purchaser who acquires 10 or more residential dwellings (other than apartments) within a 12 month period.</p><p>When the threshold of 10 is passed, the higher 10% rate applies in respect of all purchases within the 12-month period.  For example, a purchase of 4 houses in August 2021 would be liable at normal residential rates.  If the same purchaser acquires a further 6 units in November 2021, the 10% rate applies on all 10 houses, with credit allowed for stamp duty already paid on the earlier purchases.</p><p>The measure applies in respect of bulk purchases of residential dwellings, other than of apartments in apartment blocks. Apartments are defined as a multi-storey building of 5 or more units, having common or shared access.  <b></b></p><p>Alongside the recent stamp duty measure, my Department has also introduced a number of measures in recent years designed to regularise the tax affairs of property focussed investment funds and to ensure they are taxed at an appropriate level . </p><p>Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland, based on an established international standard. The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. </p><p>Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime to address the use of certain fund vehicles facilitating the investment in Irish property by non-resident investors, thereby avoiding a charge to tax on profits arising from Irish real estate. The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. </p><p>Finance Act 2019 made amendments to the taxation of REITs and IREFs to ensure the regimes operate as intended. In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct Dividend Withholding Tax to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.</p><p>Given the timescales involved in property investment, it is not yet possible to assess the impact of the various more recent measures, including (where appropriate) their impact on the affordability of housing. I can however assure the Deputy that my Department keeps tax issues under ongoing review and I will consider any further measures in respect of the taxation of property funds if and when I think it necessary.</p></reply>

In particular, the ESRI refer to potential for increased revenue by bringing properties built since 2013 into the charge for tax. This supports the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to take this course of action  which is projected to deliver a yield of &euro;560 million. </p>  <p>  Aside from the role of the Local Property Tax as a functional wealth tax, it is also important to note the ESRI&rsquo;s findings of the difficulties associated with introducing a wider wealth tax. Namely, that it would be difficult to raise substantial revenues from a wealth tax without applying it at a low level, with few exemptions. However, without such exemptions, tax liabilities would fall heavily on low income households. Furthermore, the authors refer to a number of economic distortions which could result from the introduction of a wealth tax, such as potential disincentives for earnings, to a further increase in the price of owner-occupied housing. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, as well as the Local Property Tax, Ireland already taxes wealth in a variety of other ways, such as through our Capital Gains Tax and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT),  which are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of CAT.  </p>  <p>  I would also highlight that analysis previously undertaken by the ESRI, using OECD data, shows that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system does more than any other country in the EU to reduce the gap between market and disposable incomes, which is an important consideration in wider discussions around the redistributive role of our tax system. </p>  <p>  My Department keeps tax options under ongoing review, but there is no plan at this time for it to conduct a specific analysis of the type the Deputy suggests. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Action Plan for Insurance Reform also commits to examine the forthcoming final report and recommendations of the Central Bank <i>Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets</i>and take any appropriate actions as deemed necessary, in light of the final publication.  </p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Interim Report, published in December, marks an important milestone in its review of the issue and summarises the initial observations from its ongoing market analysis and consumer research.  I look forward to the final report being published shortly.  I note that the Central Bank has stated that differential pricing can be associated with both benefits and costs for consumers. Accordingly, completion of the analysis will be essential in order to ensure a full market perspective, evidence-based conclusions and in turn appropriately calibrated regulatory interventions as are needed to apply to the specificities of the Irish market.  In addition, the associated consumer research will also provide insights which will be essential to the Central Banks&rsquo;s overall analysis.</p><p>Both Minister of State Fleming and I have repeatedly called on the industry to treat its customers fairly and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  Minister of State Fleming has raised his concerns with the main insurers that dual pricing in particular may be unfair for some customers and that it be proactive in responding to the Central Bank&rsquo;s interim findings.  However, the Government also believes that prior to bringing forward any solutions, it is important that the Central Bank&rsquo;s review is completed, so as to ensure remedies are evidence-based and do not impact consumers negatively, including impacting the ability of consumers to shop around for better deals.  This position is consistent with the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</p><p>In advance of the publication of that report, my Department is proactively considering issues raised in the general debate on this, including the Private Member&rsquo;s Bill proposed by Deputy Doherty in February.  As part of this work, it is examining recent developments in the UK, where the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced of a ban on the practice of &lsquo;price walking&rsquo; for motor and home insurers, to come into effect next year.  This is the practice where providers initially offer a lower premium to new customers, which is then increased in subsequent years on renewal.  While my Department is not directly consulting the FCA on its policy statement at this time, my officials are engaging, both through our Embassy in London and directly, with the UK Treasury on this and other financial services issues of relevance.  I would expect that during the course of this work, in particular following the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report, that relevant stakeholders will be consulted, as necessary, so as to ensure that any policy solution proposed is fully considered and evidence-based.</p></reply>

This framework has evolved significantly over the past two decades, particularly following the economic and fiscal crisis, which saw the rules strengthened through the adoption of the so-called Six- and Two-pack legislative packages.</p>  <p>  Early last year, the Commission opened a formal review of the Six- and Two-pack, including the launch of a public consultation on the operation of the fiscal rules. Discussions around this review were paused because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the public consultation suspended.  I welcome the recent confirmation by the European Commission that they intend to relaunch the public debate on the fiscal framework when the post-pandemic recovery takes hold.  </p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that investment in the productive capacity of our economy is key to our future prospects. In particular, robust public capital investment will be needed to achieve our ambitions in the context of the green and digital transitions. Formally, the EU fiscal rules do not place any limits on public investment, as additional expenditure is always possible provided it is financed by revenue-raising measures or matched by offsetting reductions in current expenditure. However, we must recognise that, prior to the pandemic, there was already evidence of an investment gap across Europe. The role of the EU fiscal rules in creating or tackling this investment gap is a complex question but one which I believe we must consider at both a national and European level, particularly in the context of the EU&rsquo;s long-term strategy to move to an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  My officials and I will actively engage in these discussions. However, it must be recognised that there are difficult trade-offs involved. This means that finding agreement will be challenging.</p></reply>

This suspension has recently been extended to 30th September 2021.</p>  <p>  As the public health situation is not yet resolved and restrictions are being eased on a gradual basis, many businesses will continue to be impacted by restrictions for some period of time as the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  Reinstating the entitlement for employees to claim redundancy before the end of September 2021 would have a serious impact on the potential for a business to recover and push many into insolvency situations, exacerbate employment losses and delay economic recovery.</p>  <p>  This further extension to 30th September 2021 will afford businesses some time to recover and provide them with some breathing space to consider their financial position and assess their future staffing requirements as the economy gradually reopens.</p>  <p>  The extension is also important for employees to ensure that they have a continued link to their job and a pathway to return. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme have also been extended from the end of June to support affected employees.</p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force. If an employer is going to make an employee redundant, protections such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employee still apply and the existing suite of employment rights legislation remains in place.</p></reply>

Research in this area is highly valuable for informing policy development. I take positives from this report such as employment rates growing for many of these groups over the period 2014 to 2019 as an indicator of a pre-pandemic baseline. I also note that there is still progress to be made in relation to challenges which young workers, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, lone parents and those with lower educational attainment face when trying to access decent work, when compared to the general population.</p>  <p>  One of the key lessons highlighted in the report is in relation to the need for robust and widespread disaggregated data in order to better understand equality in Ireland. There has been other recent work in this space with the publication of the report &lsquo;Ireland's UN SDGs &ndash; Goal 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 2021&rsquo; which is the 8th in a series of publications from the Central Statistics Office monitoring how Ireland is progressing towards meeting its targets under the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations. This report was done in collaboration with my Department and provides indicators in relation to decent work, employment rights and policies, economic growth and infrastructure. Together with the work from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and ESRI report it will allow for better ongoing monitoring of Ireland&rsquo;s current position on decent work. </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to work to promote decent work by strengthening employment rights. Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance.  Ireland&rsquo;s employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of service, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees. Employment rights legislation was strengthened by the addition of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 which prohibited zero-hour contracts except in the following circumstances: </p>  <p>  - Where the work is of a casual nature;</p>  <p>  - Where the work is done in emergency circumstances; or</p>  <p>  - Short-term relief work to cover routine absences for the employer</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work on multiple aspects of decent work such as those outlined in the ESRI report: access to work; adequate earnings; employee voice; security and stability of work; equality of opportunity and treatment in employment; and health and safety. The Deputy will also be aware of Government commitments to progress a living wage and a statutory sick pay scheme.</p></reply>

The legislation has been on the statute book for a number of years and given the changes in retail and trading environments, it was considered an opportune time to review the legislation. The consultation sought the views of interested parties, including local authorities, on matters relating to the Act.</p>  <p>   My Department engaged a legal researcher to examine the submissions received to the public consultation exercise and to prepare an options paper which would provide the basis for a policy review of the legislation. While this was completed last year, unfortunately it has not been possible to progress the review of the Act any further due to the necessity of pursuing other priorities and responding to demands arising in the context of Brexit and COVID-19. It is envisaged that the review of the Act will continue when time and resources allow.</p>  <p>   In the meantime, local authorities continue to operate the provisions of the Casual Trading Act 1995 as before.</p></reply>

Some 180 fishing vessels come within the scope of that Scheme.</p><p>Arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and in line with the Health Services Executive (HSE) and Government advice regarding non-essential services at the time, on-site employment-rights related inspection activity by WRC inspectors was suspended for a period with effect from 13 March, 2020. From early-June 2020, in addition to their statutory functions, all WRC Inspectors have been deployed in support of the Health and Safety Authority in ensuring that Covid-19 Return to Work Safety Protocols are being observed in specified sectors. To the period June 2020 to end May this year WRC inspectors completed almost 6,800 such Covid-19 visits which were carried out alongside the WRC broader remit.  All such visits and inspections must be carried out in a manner that does not place the WRC staff or the management and/or employees at hazard in the context of Covid-19. </p><p>Where on-site inspection activity was not advisable in current circumstances, the WRC undertook remote inspections of employment law compliance across all sectors in 2020 and to date this year by means of  interviews with employers and employees by way voice or video call and examination of records and documentation made available to the WRC through a secure share file facility. In terms of fisher activity, some 36 inspections which included one on-board inspection were completed in the fisheries sector in the 12-month period 1<sup>st</sup>June 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup>May 2021, covering some 40 vessels coming within the scope of the Atypical Scheme. Some 454 fisheries inspections have now been undertaken by WRC Inspectors since the introduction of the Atypical Scheme. </p><p>43 contraventions of employment rights or employment permits legislation were detected in the fisheries sector in the 12-month period to 31<sup>st</sup>May, 2021.  This brings to 323 the number of contraventions detected by WRC Inspectors since the introduction of the Atypical Scheme. These 43 contraventions can be categorised as follows: </p><p>-  Failure to grant Annual Leave and Public Holiday entitlements (11)</p><p>-  Unauthorised deductions from wages (3)</p><p>-  Failure to cooperate and/or comply with a lawful direction (9)</p><p>-  Failure to pay the National Minimum Hourly rate of pay (3)</p><p>-  Employment of fishers without permission (5)</p><p>-  Contraventions of Atypical Worker Scheme (3)</p><p>-  Contraventions of Working Time Regulations (referred to Department of Transport) (8)</p><p>-  Contravention of safety training regulations (referred to Department of Transport) (1) </p><p>Fishing vessel owners who do not effect compliance on a voluntary basis, following the issue of a Contravention Notice, will, depending on the legislation involved,  be issued with a Compliance Notice or Fixed Payment Notice or face prosecution. Current policy provides for the initiation of prosecution proceedings in relation to the offence of employing a non-EEA national without a valid permission to work. </p><p>54 fisheries investigations/cases were closed during the 12-month period to end May 2021. Currently, there are open investigations in a further 51 cases, in 7 of which legal proceedings have been issued while Contravention Notices have issued in 11 cases. Investigations are on-going in the remaining 36 cases.</p></reply>

Ventilation is best achieved by direct access to outdoor air, but artificial circulation of outdoor air through a ventilation system fitted with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are also affective.</p>  <p>  The reason for improving ventilation is to minimise transmission, so that the level of &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; outside air should be maximised therefore reducing the level of recirculated air in the workspace, unless high-efficiency particulate filters (HEPA) are installed in the ventilation system. The Protocol is of the opinion that reoccupying workplaces should not, in most cases, require new ventilation systems but improvements to ventilation will help increase the quantity of clean air and reduce the risk of exposure to airborne concentrations of the virus.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007, employers are required to make sure enclosed workplaces have an adequate supply of fresh air (ventilation) in enclosed areas of the workplace.  The requirement remains in place irrespective of the Protocol.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority provide the following advice to employers to meet this responsibility:</p>  <p>  -  natural ventilation which relies on passive air flow through windows, doors and air vents that can be fully or partially opened. This is the simplest way to ensure adequate air quality in poorly ventilated areas.</p>  <p>  -  mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts including window fans to bring in fresh air from outside, or</p>  <p>  -  a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation, for example where mechanical ventilation relies on natural ventilation to maximise fresh air.</p>  <p>  Employers should also consider regulatory requirements under building, food and/or health and safety regulations when planning any changes to ventilation at a workplace.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). CRU was assigned this responsibility following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. It has a wide range of customer protection functions under the above framework which are implemented via the various Codes of Practice set out in CRU&rsquo;s Supplier Handbook. As part of its statutory role, the CRU monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop. It also oversees non-price aspects of competition, and continues to take steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets. Measures introduced by the CRU include a stipulation that electricity suppliers provide customers with an Estimated Annual Bill, highlighting the yearly average electricity bill for a particular electricity supplier rather than just the discounted offers. Additionally, suppliers must issue a written notification on an annual basis to prompt consumers who have been on the same tariff or on a non-discounted tariff for more than 3 years to consider switching.</p><p>  The ERA states that the CRU shall account for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and not to me as Minister. Given this CRU statutory accountability to an Oireachtas Committee, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to CRU, including on its customer protection functions, at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.   Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has investigated the matter and have established that high speed broadband is available from a service provider operating in Coachford and that the premises referred to in the Question should be able to access speeds of up to 80Mbps through existing network infrastructure.</p></reply>

Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) is the designated National Gas Emergency Manager (NGEM) appointed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  GNI prepare a &ldquo;Natural Gas Emergency Plan&rdquo; which is subject to approval by the CRU in pursuance of its statutory functions in respect of security of gas supply.</p>  <p>  GNI&rsquo;s Natural Gas Emergency Plan, which is publicly available, sets out in detail the procedure for managing a Network Gas Emergency and provides details on the role of GNI as the National Gas Emergency Manager NGEM. In addition, the Gas and Electricity Emergency Planning Group (GEEP) is chaired by CRU and comprises representation from my Department, EirGrid (electricity Transmission System Operator), ESB Networks and GNI (Gas Transmission System Operator). The GEEP assesses the robustness of existing emergency procedures, including interdependencies between gas flows and electricity generation, on an ongoing basis.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the loss of gas supply to Ireland is considered by CRU by way of Risk Assessment and the preparation of Preventive Action Plans and Emergency Plans to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of gas.  The risk assessment and plans are required by EU Regulation 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and CRU is Ireland&rsquo;s designated Competent Authority for this EU regulation. The Risk Assessment takes into account various scenarios, both short and long term gas supply disruptions and assesses the likely consequences.  The Preventive Action Plan and the Emergency Plans contain measures to remove or mitigate identified risks to gas supply disruption.</p>  <p>  The European Union Network and Information Services Directive requires that an operator of essential services in the energy and other sectors shall</p>  <p>  (a) take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the network and information systems which it uses in its operations, and</p>  <p>  (b) take appropriate measures to prevent and minimise the impact of incidents affecting the security of the network and information systems used by it for the provision of the essential services in respect of which it is designated as an operator of essential services with a view to ensuring the continuity of the provision by it of those services.</p>  <p>  The measures to be taken by an operator of essential services shall ensure, having regard to the state of the art, a level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risks posed.</p>  <p>  While, like any other company, GNI could be susceptible to a cyber attack, GNI is committed to the highest level of compliance possible within the EU framework of Directives, standards and requirements. I am informed that the company takes a proactive approach to ensure that sufficient controls are in place and tested, and has invested extensively in its security infrastructure and internal controls in recent years.    </p>  <p>  A dedicated team in the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides guidance to its constituents, including Government Departments and agencies, together with operators of essential services, on appropriate measures they can take to reduce the risk of ransomware incidents on their networks. Immediately following the recent attack on the HSE, staff at the NCSC were in direct contact with the operators of essential services and this was followed up with a number of detailed confidential briefings for key sectors. The NCSC has also issued a number of confidential advisories to these constituent organisations. </p></reply>

The Statement also noted that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system.    In 2020, data centres represented approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland. EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029. EirGrid has recently launched a public consultation, 'Shaping our Electricity Future', which considers potential geographic restrictions and incentives for large demand users such as data centres to locate in areas of the network closer to where electricity is generated.  In addition, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities issued a consultation last week on a proposed direction to the system operators regarding data centre grid connections.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. The review will consider the impact of increased demand, including from the data centre sector, and will identify and appraise policy options that could be implemented to ensure security of electricity supply.</p>  <p>  There is significant opportunity through innovation, renewable generation, demand flexibility and storage to drive a clean digital economy to underpin our economic success into the future, and data centres must play their part in supporting our net zero climate ambitions. </p>  <p>  My Department is evaluating policies to encourage the development of renewable energy projects by the data centre sector to meet their own demand and to contribute to the target set out in the Climate Action Plan of meeting 15% of electricity demand through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) by 2030. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland launched a public consultation on policy options for meeting the target, which closed on 14 April 2021. Based on the consultation feedback and other considerations, a recommendations paper on a roadmap for CPPAs will be developed later in 2021. </p></reply>

Ireland supported the hydrogen strategy, including the need to deploy green hydrogen in line with the Programme for Government. Ireland also supported the publication of the Council Conclusions on a hydrogen market for Europe in October 2020. In the development of these conclusions, Ireland strongly supported the need to focus on green hydrogen.</p><p>My Department is working with relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders to inform Ireland's future policies in relation to hydrogen.

The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is the main government support to help deliver on this target.  </p>  <p>  The first RESS auction included a dedicated community projects category in which seven projects have been selected for support, five of which are collaborations with commercial developers. My aim is to ensure the delivery of some 100 community electricity generation projects by 2030. In future onshore RESS auctions, there will be additional capacity allocated to the community category and I have decided that only fully community-owned projects will be eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure an adequate pipeline of community renewable electricity projects I have allocated &euro;3.2 million in funding this year for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to stimulate locally-owned community energy projects, &euro;3 million of which is capital expenditure and &euro;200,000 of which is current expenditure. </p>  <p>  The funding allocated will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including information dissemination, trusted intermediary and advisor services, and financial supports. I will announce further details of this enabling framework shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department outlined proposals for a new Micro-generation Support Scheme in a public consultation that closed on 18 February. It is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers, including smaller scale community renewable energy projects, in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to a household under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the Warmer Homes work programme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months nationally. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p><p>The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather. </p><p>The below table provides the approximate share of homes on the work programme for each qualifying payment.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Qualifying Payment</th>       <th>% Breakdown</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carers Allowance</td>       <td>12%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td>       <td>10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fuel Allowance</td>       <td>71%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Job Seekers Allowance, and child under 7</td>       <td>1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>One-Parent Family Payment</td>       <td>1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Working Family Payment</td>       <td>5%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Generating additional demand for energy upgrades will be necessary in order to achieve these targets.  SEAI has conducted qualitative and quantitative research among homeowners in order to clearly identify the most important benefits and most significant challenges associated with retrofit. This research shows that we need to convince homeowners of the comfort, cost and environmental benefits of home energy upgrades. We need to inform them of the availability of grants to support their efforts as well as free services for eligible energy poor homes. Finally we need to mitigate misgivings homeowners may have about cost of works and disruption. </p>  <p>  SEAI Home Retrofit Demand Generation activity is constantly developing with successful programme promotion and awareness building ongoing.  One recent example was actively targeting Heat Pump installations following the lifting of Covid lockdown restrictions in April. SEAI are also currently preparing a comprehensive national demand generation campaign which will commence in quarter three 2021. The campaign is currently being developed and is being informed by the insights above as well as the expertise of the Authority&rsquo;s behavioural economics team. SEAI will also undertake a number of community based social marketing events in various locations around the country. These are targeted marketing campaigns underpinned by theories of behaviour change.</p>  <p>  In 2021 the budget allocation for demand generation is &euro;1.05 million (current expenditure) with approximately 10% of budget expended to date.</p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. The development of the national retrofit framework to achieve these targets is well underway.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme.  This project has been selected for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan.  The specific features of the scheme and the financial model of the guarantee are still under development.</p>  <p>  The part-Exchequer and part-EU funded loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint.  </p>  <p>  The loan guarantee is expected to help to increase the volume of retrofit activity within the State and improve the recovery and resilience of the supply chain within the retrofit sector. The scheme will also signal to the banking sector new viable business opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments.While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable electricity users, including farmers, to meet their own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewable generators in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II).</p>  <p>  Article 21(2)(d) of RED II provides that the rate of remuneration for exported renewable electricity shall be one which reflects the market value of that electricity and which may take into account its long-term value to the grid, the environment and society.

Surveys are completed or ongoing in the areas of Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, Bunnyconnellan, Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla and Ringarraun, Newport, Carrowbeg, Inishgort, Inishcottle, Myna, Fahy, Ashbridge, Glenisland, Srahmore, Glenhest, Comploon, Slogger and Tawnameeltoge.</p>  <p>  Build works are currently underway in the  Deployment Area that covers Castlebar and the surrounding townlands including Turlough, Ballyhean, Clooneen, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen and Burren. I am advised by NBI that the it expects premises in these areas to be passed and available for connection before the end of 2021. The number of premises anticipated to be passed by NBI in Mayo by the end of 2021 is some 2,100 premises.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project.</p>  <p>  ​Further details are available on specific areas within Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 June, 322 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband include Keel Community Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Belderrig Community &amp;amp; Research Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Bofeenaun Community Centre and Islandeady Community Centre.</p>  <p>  Cloghans National School, Scoil N&eacute;finn, Midfield National School, Meelick More National School, Kinaffe National School, Facefield National School, Errew National School, Shraigh National School, Rathbane National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dookinella National School, Tavraun Central National School and Saint Coleman&rsquo;s National School are also installed as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households with the balance of &euro;112.5 million to be spent on expanding existing SEAI grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. One such initiative is the National Home Retrofit Scheme (One Stop Shop Development Call). This new support scheme is designed to encourage the development of retrofit One-Stop-Shops, to support home retrofit on a larger scale, and support the growth of the retrofitting industry.  The scheme facilitates home upgrades for private households, registered Housing Associations and Local Authorities who wish to participate in delivering home energy efficiency upgrades.  More details of this scheme, which has been well received by the market, are available on the SEAI website at www.seai.ie/grants/national-home-retrofit/National-Home-Retrofit-Scheme-Guidelines.pdf  </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently working with SEAI to develop other initiatives including a further scheme that will facilitate the retrofitting of homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2, at scale and managed by one stop shops.  It is intended to launch the scheme later this year.</p></reply>

This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives. A further &euro;65 million has been allocated to retrofit social housing administered by the Department of Housing. </p><p>The number of homes retrofitted in 2020 and to date in 2021 with SEAI support, and the spend to date on each scheme in each year is set out in the table below. In 2020, SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes supported the upgrading of over 17,600 homes. The number of retrofits last year were unfortunately, negatively impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions. Enhanced COVID restrictions between January and April also had a significant impact on activity this year.

OGCIO have confirmed the following with regard to the accessibility of gov.ie:- Gov.ie partially complies with the double-A Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 standards and the 4 principles of accessibility in that it is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. This is similar to most other government sites across the European Union.- One way that accessibility is being improved is by improving the level of plain English used for services on the site. This allows users of all levels to be able to find and understand information as quickly as possible.- The gov.ie team have performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website has gone live. The gov.ie team has engaged with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. This is an ongoing process.- Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were fixed and OGCIO have since released updates to the core code of the site to improve accessibility.</p><p>My Department's digital content manager ensures all content uploaded by the team meets all accessibility requirements set out by OGCIO in relation to this directive including plain language, text formatting, image descriptions/alt text.Our agencies have been made aware of their obligations under this directive and compliance is a matter for each individual organisation.</p></reply>

Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, Minister Ryan launched a new national waste policy for the period 2020-2025, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. This plan contains a range of measures to empower households through enhanced consumer protection requirements. It also envisages an enhanced monitoring of the market to ensure continued relative price stability.</p></reply>

Pre-build works are ongoing in Midleton. </p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Cavan and in Carrigaline, County Cork. I am advised by NBI that, as of 10 June nearly 4,400 homes are passed and available for connection in both Counties Cork and Cavan. In County Cork, 871 premises have now been passed by the NBI high speed broadband network in Carriagline. NBI anticipates that the remaining premises in the Carrigaline Deployment Area will be able to access connection to the network in July of this year. A further 15,000 premises can also pre-order via retail service providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway and Limerick and get a connection in the coming months.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 10 June, 325 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband include Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Clogagh Community Hall, T.O. Park Labbamollaga, Ballindangan Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Sherkin Island Community Hall, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Glash Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre and Castletownkenneigh Community Centre.</p><p>Clogagh and Ballycroneen National Schools are installed as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at <i>www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>. </p></reply>

In order to improve traceability of waste received and to counter the trade in stolen metal, an amendment to the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations was introduced in 2014 to require the following at all permitted facilities receiving/purchasing waste: the production of proof of identity and current address for the person supplying the material; records to be kept of the registration number and waste collection permit number of the delivery vehicle; records to be kept describing the materials, time and date of sale, weight and amount paid; and the provision of a signed statement by the person supplying the material indicating that they are the lawful owner.The Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have issued guidance to all waste facility permit holders, including Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATFs) for end-of-life vehicles, advising them of their responsibilities in this regard and local authorities continue to undertake inspections to ensure compliance with the regulations. Indeed, these inspections have been included in the National Waste Enforcement Priorities for 2021 and the WERLAs are working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating incidences of catalytic convertor theft. </p><p>My Department also participates in the National Metal Theft Forum, which was established in 2012 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to bring together stakeholders, including local authorities, the Department of Justice, and industry representatives, in order to improve information sharing and to develop a metal theft prevention and crime reduction plan.</p></reply>

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November 2019 with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.There are 615,682 premises in County Dublin of which 602,253 (98%) are in the commercial area and 13,429 (2%) premises are within the NBP Intervention Area. I am advised that the areas referred to in the Question contain premises in both Blue and Amber areas. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p><p>The AMBER areas within the areas referred to are located in the Enniskerry deployment area and NBI has advised that surveying has be completed in the area and the premises will be provided with access to highspeed broadband under the  NBP ensuring that none of the premises will be left behind.</p><p>Despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network. NBI has advised that as of the 10 June over 225,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties of which 2,437 premises have been surveyed in County Dublin.</p><p>This survey work has enabled detailed designs to be developed for each deployment area including Enniskerry. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre.

This legislation, introduced in 1997, is critical to supporting farm plastics recycling as it places a legal responsibility on producers of farm film products to specifically support recycling. </p>  <p>  The options open to producers placing farm film products on the Irish market is to either become directly involved in the recycling of farm plastics waste with their customers or to participate in the Government approved farm plastics recycling scheme operated by Irish Farm Film Plastics Group (IFFPG) and approved by my Department.</p>  <p>  IFFPG is a not for profit body and was reapproved for a five year term at the start of this year. While my Department sets the policy and legislative framework for the farm plastics waste stream, it has no role in the operational and day to day matters of the approved compliance scheme. Under the terms of the approval, IFFPG are required to publish an annual operational report and audited accounts and these are publicly available on their website www.farmplastics.ie/publications/. These documents contain details on the levy and the contractor tendering process, which is held every 5 years and is administered by independent auditors. I understand that the most recent contractor tender process took place during the end of 2019 / early 2020.</p></reply>

The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload.However, it has come to my Department&rsquo;s attention that a number of BLUE premises are having difficulty connecting to a commercial high speed network and may continue to do so in the future.Officials in my Department are examining a number of premises, including the ones referred to in the Question, and will ensure that access to high speed broadband is made available either through commercial means or through the National Broadband Plan intervention. Where appropriate and if compliant with State aid rules, premises may be reclassified as AMBER on the high speed broadband map. Before reclassification can be confirmed, a formal review process must be undertaken to ensure that the State is compliant with State Aid rules and the State aid approval which enabled the contract to be awarded under the National Broadband Plan. My Department is currently formally engaging with commercial operators in relation to a number of premises, including the premises referred to in the Question and the outcome of these deliberations is expected shortly. This will enable a formal reclassification of premises where appropriate.</p><p>The NBP High Speed Broadband Map is dynamic. This means that the intervention area can be updated to reflect new commercial plans, or previous plans that have failed to materialise. This flexibility allows for an increase or decrease in the number of premises included in the State Intervention area, if appropriate to do so. </p></reply>

EU Directive 2003/59/EC, which introduced driver CPC, was updated in 2018 by EU Directive 645 of 2018 and, while the amended Directive allows for the use of ICT tools such as e-learning and blended learning as part of CPC training, a substantial amount of the training is required to be completed in an approved driver CPC training centre.</p>  <p>  The RSA believes that delivering some part of the training online is the way forward and it intends to consult with the industry, including all driver CPC training organisations, to establish how training can be enhanced and improved within the scope of the opportunities provided for in the EU legislation. It is hoped that this review will start later in 2021.</p></reply>

In line with the gradual reopening of services, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have recommenced in a limited fashion.</p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to help the service meet the growing demand for tests within the current public health situation.  An additional 40 driver testers have been authorised by the Minister along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020.  Further recruitment is being examined.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols.</p>  <p>  From the start, it has been clear that the first priority is public safety. We want to provide services, and we know people are looking for services, but we will provide them only to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p></reply>

This discretion does not extend, however, to allowing all cyclists to use footpaths. As the Deputy may recall, in 2015 one of my predecessors as Minister for Transport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, introduced fixed charge notices for a number of cycling offences, including cycling without reasonable consideration.

The Forum comprises the ADI Chief Examiner and ADIs who are elected by their peers to represent the views of their colleagues and are supported by an RSA administrative team.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Forum reflects the importance of active engagement and consultation with the driving instruction industry by the Road Safety Authority, while respecting the fact that the industry is made up of very many and varied enterprises, many if not most of whom are sole traders or other forms of microenterprise.  It therefore takes into account the provisions of competition law which preclude any form of anti-competitive collusion or collective action by such enterprises. </p>  <p>  The Forum elects an independent Chairperson who reports directly to the Registrar on matters requiring his or her attention. Forum members in turn report directly back to their ADI&rsquo;s and the Stakeholders they represent, seeking views on relevant issues and reporting those views back to the forum for discussion.</p>  <p>  Forum members represent a geographical area linked to ADIs working in each of the nine Driver Testing regions, with two additional representatives, one for North Leinster and one for South Leinster. The total number of ADI representatives on the forum can be up to 11 persons.</p>  <p>  Elections are normally held every 3 years, but the election due in Autumn 2020 was deferred to early 2021 due to reasons relating to the Covid-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Forum members are requested to attend at least 3 meetings per year. In order to be most effective maximum attendance whenever possible is required. If a Forum member fails to attend two consecutive meetings without informing the Chairman, the Forum may consider inviting nominations for a replacement member from within the relevant Driver Testing region.</p>  <p>  Any ADI wishing to be considered for a position on the Forum must themselves be a fully registered ADI and have their nomination form counter signed by a minimum of five ADIs in their immediate regional Driver Testing area. Where there is an oversubscription of nominations for the Forum, geographical and demographical considerations apply.</p></reply>

For this reason, our aviation policy places a priority on international connectivity. The sector is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years for it to return to 2019 levels of activity.</p>  <p>  Several public health measures have been introduced in relation to international travel, which have developed and evolved as the pandemic has progressed, with the objective of both limiting the spread of COVID-19 and limiting the presence of its variants of concern in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The main requirement of all aviation stakeholders has been clarity from Government on a plan to permit the resumption of non-essential international air travel, and the Government outlined such a plan on 28 May, which is scheduled to begin on 19 July. This plan brings together the EU Digital COVID Certificates, pre-departure PCR testing, mandatory quarantine, and our public health measures so that international travel can operate safely. An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern.</p>  <p>  The use of  antigen testing in relation to international travel is a matter for the Minister for Health in the first instance, and Government decisions relating to COVID-19 testing are based on public health advice.</p>  <p>  While it may take some time for our aviation sector to regain the strong economic position it had at the start of the pandemic, Government has committed to ensuring that there will be no &ldquo;cliff-edge&rdquo; to the COVID-19 related business supports that are currently available. On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most. Importantly, this plan also recognised that additional support may be required for the recovery of the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  With our vaccination programme progressing, a plan for the resumption of non-essential international travel ready and significant levels of business supports available, aviation is now positioned to begin to recover.</p></reply>

The MSO selects fishing vessels for inspections based on a number of criteria including follow-up on any incidents as well as referrals from a number of sources including other Member States, members of the public, fishers, Workplace Relations Commission or An Garda Siochana amongst others. The MSO carries out such inspections in relation to several relevant instruments, the Atypical Worker Scheme for non-EEA fishers is not of itself such a relevant instrument.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of unannounced inspections carried out on Irish flagged fishing vessels in 2020, 19 such inspections were carried out. 11 such inspections have been carried out by the MSO so far during 2021. The MSO does not identify non-compliances, it may identify deficiencies in relation to the relevant instruments which are applicable to the vessel concerned. The action to be taken in such cases is in accordance with the professional judgement of the attending MSO surveyor. The Master and/or owner, as appropriate, are issued with a report of inspection which details deficiencies and the action to be taken.  If deficiencies cannot be rectified during the inspection then the MSO surveyors may require &ldquo;rectification before departure&rdquo;, &ldquo;rectification within 14 days&rdquo; or &ldquo;other, as specified by the surveyor&rdquo;.  The MSO may also require the submission of records for further examination and may also carry out follow up inspections as appropriate to check on progress or closing out of deficiencies. The MSO may detain vessels in cases of serious or continuous non-compliance and prosecution of offences through the courts may also follow in such cases.</p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach are continuing the work to ensure Ireland is in a position to comply with the EUDCC as required.</p><p>From 19 July, subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will operate the EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) for travel originating within the EU/EEA.</p><p>A DCC will show if a passenger is vaccinated against COVID-19; has recovered from COVID-19; or has a negative test result.</p><p>Passengers arriving into Ireland with a DCC will not have to undergo quarantine. However, passengers with a DCC based on a non-PCR test (for example, an antigen test), or those arriving without a DCC, will require proof of a negative RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.</p><p>Children aged between 7 and 18 who have not been vaccinated must also have a negative RT-PCR test.</p><p>A passenger who has been in a non-EU/EEA country in the 14 days prior to arrival into Ireland will be subject to the rules applying to that country.</p><p>All passengers will be advised to observe public health restrictions and to present for post-arrival testing if they develop symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>It is important to note that the EU DCC is not a travel document. The possession of an EU DCC will not be a precondition to travel.  Individual Member States will determine how the DCC will be used as part of national public health measures.</p><p>Furthermore, from 19 July, Ireland will also broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries (outside EU/EEA). </p><p>To protect its citizens against the importation of variants, an &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be coordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest.</p></reply>

Customers who cannot be accommodated in June because of volume restrictions will have to be rescheduled. The RSA have advised that there is no need for candidates to contact the Theory Test service - affected customers will be contacted directly. They are being resceduled into next available slot in their chosen location. </p>  <p>  The test centres have extensive COVID-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. It is hoped that capacity will gradually increase to 50,000 tests per month over time, if public health guidance permits. </p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online theory test service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  </p>  <p>  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. From mid-June, the RSA plans to increase this by a further 2,000.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.636.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500071#WRN05600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question, however, no account of the support given to the taxi and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector would be complete without referring to the broad framework of horizontal support measures this Government has made available due to this pandemic. </p>  <p>  The SPSV industry has been badly affected by COVID-19. Passenger demand for services has dropped and many SPSV operators simply haven&rsquo;t worked since the start of the pandemic. I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. It is impossible to say just how much the nation&rsquo;s 25,000 taxi drivers have received from the PUP as it is calculated with reference to an individual&rsquo;s pre-pandemic earnings. However, it would undoubtedly be a very significant amount &ndash; an individual on the lowest rate of PUP, &euro;203 per week, would have received over &euro;10,500 after 12 months on the payment. The Deputy will be aware that the PUP has been extended to February 2022.</p>  <p>  Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8 week period, net of expenses. As society begins to reopen and passenger demand for taxis increases, this will become an important support for drivers as they return to work. Drivers who earn over &euro;960 may be eligible for the COVID-19 Part Time Job Incentive for the Self-Employed Scheme. The COVID-19 Enterprise Support Scheme, worth up to &euro;1,000, is also open to SPSV operators to meet the costs associated with returning to work. All of these schemes are administered by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  That is the context in which my Department has funded additional measures specifically targeted at the costs incurred by SPSV industry. As the Deputy will be aware, many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. In last year&rsquo;s Budget, I allocated approximately &euro;2.6 million towards the waiver of standard vehicle licence fees, in recognition of the fact that this was a cost borne by SPSV operators which could not be deferred. </p>  <p>  The replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator and I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. That is why I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million. I also doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. This scheme can be used in conjunction with COVID-19 investment and liquidity measures, such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over 500 applications received to date.</p>  <p>  In April I met with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs and discussed my hope that passenger demand would begin to return this summer as public health restrictions are lifted and the tourism and hospitality industries begins to reopen. I understand the difficulties facing operators across the country and considered possible additional measures to target the statutory, non-deferable costs faced by SPSV operators. </p>  <p>  Last week, following consultation with the Advisory Committee, I announced further measures worth &euro;6.5 million split between 2021 and 2022 to address these costs. The measures will waive standard licence renewal fees again in 2022, and will refund the cost of NCTs and SPSV Motor Tax for a given 12 month period. The NTA will administer these refund schemes, the commencement date for which has yet to be decided, but likely to be during Q3 of 2021. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that many other measures been taken to support the industry. At the start of the pandemic, the industry&rsquo;s regulator, the National Transport Authority waived late licence renewal fees and engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. The Authority has also extended age limits for taxis and hackneys three times since the start of the pandemic. The most recent extension, made last month, ensures no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits in 2021 and I trust that the Authority will keep this issue under review as society and the economy reopens and passenger demand returns. I understand that the Authority will also shortly advance a public consultation on extending the period of time that SPSV licences may be placed in &lsquo;inactive status.&rsquo;</p></reply>

This is a project set out in the existing, statutory, <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2036 </i>and one which has been subject to extensive, non-statutory public consultation over the last 3 years. This project has now reached an important milestone as its Preliminary Business Case has been submitted to my Department for review as is required under the <i>Public Spending Code</i>. For projects of this scale, the <i>Public Spending Code</i>stipulates that Government approval is required to allow the project submit its Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Preliminary Business Case has been developed on the basis of the existing project as has been subject to public consultation in recent years. The Preferred Route for MetroLink is available to view on the dedicated project website, www.metrolink.ie and includes station location details along the route.</p><p>Secondly, we have the statutory review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 stipulates that the <i>Strategy</i>must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised Strategy. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has stated that, as part of its review, it is considering whether additional metro routes should be included in any revised <i>Strategy</i>. It has further stated that as part of the public consultation process all background studies conducted to assist with this consideration will be published and I understand this public consultation phase will commence in the coming months. </p><p>Inclusion in any revised <i>Strategy</i>is the first step in what is a very detailed and often lengthy process to enable projects move from the strategic support, enabled by inclusion in a <i>Transport Strategy,</i>to being a project with a Preliminary Business Case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process. </p></reply>

A vehicle which is both fully electric and wheelchair accessible can avail of grant support from both schemes to a combined maximum of &euro;32,500 per vehicle.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.719.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500073#WRP02200"><p>I consider that the primary objective of a vacant residential property tax or levy would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand rather than increasing tax revenues. However, before introducing such a tax it is of course important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant dwellings, and the reasons why they are vacant.</p>  <p>  An independent report on this topic commissioned by my Department was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in September 2018 in accordance with the provisions of section 86 of Finance Act 2017. The independent Indecon Consultants report on the Taxation of Vacant Residential Property presents a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.  This assessment suggests that the vacancy rate in these areas was significantly lower than the national average and had fallen in recent years. </p>  <p>  The report suggested that the vacancy rate within rent pressure zones, excluding holiday homes, was approximately 6% but that most of these vacancies were short and medium, with a low level of long term vacancies &ndash; the rate lying between 0 and 3% for Dublin for example. The report estimated the rate of properties which are vacant long term and habitable to be only 0.8% of properties in rent pressure zones. The report also suggested that the vacancy rate was likely to continue to fall due to market developments. </p>  <p>  Indecon Consultants did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax, as they did not believe it would be an effective response to deal with the housing shortages.  Indecon&rsquo;s view was that the very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium-term vacancy, indicate that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of other housing supply.</p>  <p>  It is of course necessary to monitor the position and I understand in that regard that the CSO plans to deploy an enhanced approach during the next Census to the collection of information in relation to residential properties that appear to be vacant. I would like to use the LPT revaluation opportunity to obtain some limited information about vacant residential properties which would be useful in terms of future policy making. Revenue is currently redesigning its LPT return form to take account of the new arrangements. It is likely that the questions will be limited to whether a property is vacant as at 1 November 2021, if so, if it has been vacant for a specified period and the reason for the vacancy.</p></reply>

On 1 June last, the Government announced an extension of the scheme and full details will be published in forthcoming legislation. The EWSS is an enterprise wide support available to employers of businesses impacted by Covid-19.  </p><p>The current eligibility criteria for EWSS states that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 July and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible for the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme. This includes all businesses, including start-ups, where the conditions are satisfied. </p><p>For 2020 paydates, the reduction in turnover or customer orders for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 is relative to:</p><p>- the same period in 2019 where the business was in existence prior to 1 July 2019;</p><p>- the date of commencement to 31 December 2019, where the business commenced trading between 1 July and 1 November 2019; or</p><p>- the <i>projected</i>turnover or orders for 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, where the business commenced trading after 1 November 2019.</p><p>For 2021 paydates, the reduction in turnover or customer orders for the period 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021 is relative to:</p><p>- the same period in 2019 where the business was in existence prior to 1 January 2019;</p><p>- the date of commencement to 30 June 2019, where the business commenced trading between 1 January and 1 May 2019; or</p><p>- the <i>projected</i>turnover or customer orders for 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, where the business commenced trading after 1 May 2019.</p><p>The legislation prescribes qualifying criteria and relevant timeframes for all businesses that are in start-up mode and there is no reference to, or provision for any &ldquo;cap at 37 weeks trading in 2019 for eligibility in 2020&rdquo; in either the legislation or in the Revenue Guidance.In the circumstances outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is unclear how the business which started trading in June 2019 could operate for &ldquo;39 weeks that year&rdquo;.  The business, in common with all others in a similar position, is required to demonstrate a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in the period 1 July to 31 December 2020 versus the same period in 2019 and if it is unable to do so, it is not eligible for the scheme. I am advised that the criteria for start-up businesses provided for in the EWSS legislation has worked effectively for the vast majority and I will be adopting a similar approach for the legislation to implement the extension of the EWSS recently, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.</p><p>I should also point out that the EWSS legislative provisions require that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the business must immediately cease claiming EWSS payments.</p><p>The administration of the EWSS is placed under the care and management of Revenue.  Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in the early stages was concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments received the payments quickly.  Revenue is now operating a real-time compliance programme to ensure the qualifying criteria contained in Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 are met.  This includes identifying employers who should be excluding themselves from the scheme, based on their self-review of the qualifying criteria, but have failed to do so.</p><p>Where Revenue identifies that the subsidy paid to an employer was incorrectly claimed, it must then be repaid. However, the employer has the right to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s determination that it was not eligible to avail of the scheme to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC). The appeal process requires Revenue to assess the subsidy amount owed as a &lsquo;relevant tax&rsquo; after which the employer has 30 days to lodge an appeal with the TAC.</p><p>Where the employer accepts that the subsidy amount was incorrectly claimed but cannot afford to repay it in a single payment then Revenue may agree to a phased payment arrangement over an extended timeframe. The employer may also be eligible to temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; the debt under the Debt Warehousing scheme, providing the business meets the overall eligibility criteria for that scheme.</p><p>Finally, guidelines on the operation of the EWSS including comprehensive information on employer eligibility and supporting proofs is available on the Revenue website. Information regarding the Debt Warehousing scheme is also available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.725.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500073#WRP02800"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover. </p>  <p>  The Equal Status Acts 2008-2018 prohibit certain kinds of discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, obtaining or disposing of accommodation and in relation to educational establishments. The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including age. However, the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any of the grounds (except gender) in relation to insurance &ndash; but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and are reasonable.</p>  <p>  Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy.  I understand that motor insurers, in making decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, use a combination of rating factors such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.</p>  <p>  Finally, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. This Information Service can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays tuition fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual. The relief is restricted to tuition fees and excludes other education costs such as administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees and any element of the fees met by a grant, scholarship or employer contribution. </p><p>All courses provided by publicly funded universities, colleges and institutes of higher education in Ireland are approved for the purposes of the relief. All courses provided by publicly funded or accredited universities and institutions in other EU Member States or in the UK are also approved for the purposes of the relief. This includes courses provided by colleges or institutions through distance education into Ireland. Private colleges in Ireland and private distance education colleges based in the EU or the UK must operate in accordance with a code of standards which has been approved by the Minister for Education and Skills. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the annual cost of tax relief on approved training courses or third level education fees are set out in Revenue&rsquo;s Cost of Tax Expenditures Publication, which is available on the Revenue website. This data is summarised below. The information included in the statistics at present is for 2004 to 2018.

The Comptroller and Auditor General appoints one of the three Directors as Secretary to the Office and the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform appoints that Director as Accounting Officer on foot of a nomination by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Directors are permanent civil servants, and as such, their term of office ends on retirement, resignation or dismissal.</p><p>The term of office of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland is due to expire on 31 August 2026. Part III of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, outlines that the Governor of the Central Bank is appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government for a period of 7 years which may be extended by a further 7 years. The appointment was made in accordance with the statutory requirements and the Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, as such, was advertised publicly on the State Boards website. </p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman&rsquo;s term of office will expire on the 19 April 2023. Section 8 of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 sets out the manner by which the appointment of the Ombudsman can be made, including that the appointment is consequent upon the holding of an open competition in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.</p><p>The term of office of the Chief Executive Officer of Home Building Finance Ireland expires on 31 August 2024. An open public recruitment competition is held for the role of CEO. </p><p>The term of office of a Member of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is four years and a Member may serve up to three consecutive terms of office. The Minister for Finance designates one of the Council Members as Chairperson. The current Chairperson was reappointed as a Member of the Fiscal Council in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 for a third term effective from 1 January 2021 and continues to serve as Chairperson having been appointed by the Minister to this role on 22 July 2020. This term will expire on 31 December 2024.

The appointment of the current Chairperson, was made in accordance with the statutory requirements and the Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards and, as such, was advertised publicly on the State Boards website.</p><p>The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) Chief Executive Officer was appointed by the Minister for Finance in December 2009 in accordance with Section 37 of the NAMA Act 2009. The lifespan of NAMA was always envisaged to be relatively limited and as NAMA is currently in the process of an orderly wind down, the CEO&rsquo;s term will conclude when this is completed.</p><p>The contract of the Chief Executive of the National Asset Treasury Agency (NTMA) expires on 30 June 2022. The NTMA will operate an open public recruitment competition for this role in due course. </p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has three Commissioner Positions.

This was the rate that applied in 1991 and we have been able to maintain that rate under the provisions of the EU VAT Directive that allow for a zero rate to be maintained if it applied on and from 1 January 1991. Period products with a zero rate of VAT include sanitary towels (including maternity pads), panty liners and sanitary tampons </p>  <p>From 1 January 2021, following the last Finance Bill, a reduced VAT rate of 13.5% has applied to menstrual cups, menstrual pants and menstrual sponges.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that Ireland and a number of other Member States are looking for greater flexibility in the VAT directive to allow a zero rate to be applied to these newer period products. These discussions are connected to a wider debate on VAT Rates and any agreement on VAT rates must be agreed by every Member State.</p></reply>

In the NACE system, dog breeding or dog selling are not separately categorised. In addition, these types of operations are often part of wider economic activities undertaken by taxpayers and it is therefore not possible for Revenue to identify or report on the registrations or tax paid specifically by dog sales or dog breeding.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that all economic activities, including animal breeding, are included in Revenue&rsquo;s risk intervention programmes. Under these programmes, cases are risk-ranked, drawing on a wide range of data sources including details provided directly by taxpayers and information received from third party sources. The level of risk identified in any case determines the intervention to be undertaken, ranging from assurance checks to tax audits and investigations with a view to criminal prosecution in the most egregious cases.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs teams play a vital role in supporting the DSPCA, the ISPCA and other animal welfare groups in the detection of illegal puppy exports from Irish Ports and have achieved significant successes in this regard.</p></reply>

In making a claim for the R&amp;D tax credit, companies must satisfy two tests: the activity must be a qualifying activity (a science test); and the amount of the claim must be based on R&amp;D expenditure incurred (an accounting test). </p>  <p>  To qualify for the R&amp;D tax credit, a company must be within the charge to corporation tax in the State and must undertake qualifying R&amp;D activities within the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK and, in the case of an Irish tax resident company, the expenditure must not qualify for a deduction for the purposes of tax in another territory.</p>  <p>  As tax returns do not include information in respect of the location of the research and development activity, the information requested by the Deputy in this regard cannot be provided.</p>  <p>  The definition of qualifying R&amp;D activities requires that a claimant company engage in a systematic, investigative or experimental activity which seeks to achieve a scientific or technological advancement in a field of science of technology and involves the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. </p>  <p>  Should an Irish company incur qualifying R&amp;D expenditure on a regional or development activity in Northern Ireland, it may qualify for the R&amp;D tax credit providing the expenditure does not qualify for a deduction for the purposes of tax in another territory.  It is also important to note that, where expenditure is met directly or indirectly by grant assistance from any state or other body, the expenditure will not be considered as having been incurred by the relevant company and therefore would not qualify for the R&amp;D credit.  </p>  <p>In respect of the cost, I am advised by Revenue that the latest information in respect of the tax cost of the research and development tax credit is available at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/tax-expenditures/r-and-d-tax-credits.aspx  .</p>  <p>  The year 2019 is the most recent year for which comprehensive data on the credit are available. Information in respect of 2020 will be published in 2022 when the corporation tax returns for that year, due for filing up to the end of September 2021, have been analysed.</p></reply>

To qualify for the relief, the first sale or purchase must occur between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2022. The next sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of the first sale or purchase. Following an ex-post review of this relief, the relief, which was due to expire on 31 December 2019, was extended to 31 December 2022 as part of Finance Act 2019. </p><p><b>Retirement Relief </b></p><p>Business or farming assets are relieved from CGT where the person disposing of the asset(s) is aged 55 or over and both owned and used the asset(s) for the ten years prior to the disposal. While this relief is commonly referred to as Retirement Relief, it is not necessary to retire from the business or farming in order to qualify. </p><p>The operation of the relief differs between the disposal of a business or farm to a child and disposals to anyone other than to a child. The operation of the relief also differs between persons aged 55 to 65 years and persons aged 66 years and over. </p><p>From 1 January 2014 if the person is between 55 and 65 years of age and the disposal is to a child, the full relief may be claimed. If the person is 66 years of age or older the relief is restricted to &euro;3 million. </p><p>If the child disposes of the asset within 6 years, the relief will be withdrawn and they must pay the full amount of CGT on the original disposal and the subsequent disposal. </p><p>In the case of a disposal of a business or a farm to someone other than a child, the full relief may be claimed when the market value at the time of disposal does not exceed a threshold of &euro;750,000 if the person is under 66 years of age. The threshold is &euro;500,000 if the person is 66 years of age and older. </p><p>These thresholds are lifetime limits and if they are exceeded the relief is withdrawn and CGT is payable on the gains on all disposals. Marginal relief may apply to gains that exceed the thresholds limiting CGT to half of the difference between the sale price or market value and the threshold. </p><p><b>Revised CGT Entrepreneur Relief</b></p><p>The revised CGT entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets, including shares in a qualifying company. Gains on such disposals are charged to CGT at the rate of 10%, subject to a lifetime limit of &euro;1m. </p><p>For the relief to apply, the assets must be used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual or the individual must own a shareholding of at least 5% in a company carrying on a qualifying business. A qualifying business is a business other than the holding of securities or other assets as investments, the holding of development land or the development orletting of land. Business assets must have been owned by the individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal. Where the individual disposes of shares in a qualifying company, they must have held the shares for a continuous period of 3 years at any time prior to the disposal. Agricultural assets used in a qualifying business may be considered qualifying assets for the purposes of revised entrepreneur relief. </p><p><b>Transfer of a site to a child</b></p><p>An exemption from CGT is available on the transfer of a site by a parent (or both parents simultaneously) to their child and the spouse or civil partner of that child to build a house which is the child&rsquo;s only or main residence. For the purposes of this exemption, a transfer includes a joint transfer by an individual, and their spouse or civil partner, to their child. The area of the site must not exceed 1 acre and the value of the site must not exceed &euro;500,000. </p><p>All taxes are subject to ongoing review, which involves the consideration and assessment of the rate and the relevant reliefs and exemptions. Tax policy and legislation is reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process, and is considered in the wider tax policy context. </p></reply>

Each of these reliefs is subject to certain conditions.</p><p>Revenue advises that parents supporting children outside the EU may be eligible for health expenses relief in the form of income tax relief for expenditure on certain health expenses for themselves and their dependents, including visits to the doctor, medicines, nursing care in the patient&rsquo;s home (in certain circumstances), nursing home fees, expenditure in respect of children with life threatening illnesses, kidney patients&rsquo; expenses, mileage for individuals who need to travel for treatment and certain medical appliances.  More information on tax relief for health expenses is available here: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-12.pdf</p><p>Revenue also advises that parents in the circumstances outlined may also be eligible under section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides for income tax relief in respect of qualifying tuition fees paid by an individual for a postgraduate third level education course, subject to the terms and conditions set out in that section. The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual. Claimants who pay tuition fees in instalments can claim tax relief either in the tax year when the academic year started or the tax year when the instalment is paid. </p><p>&ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college. Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students. It should be noted that any claim for relief must be submitted within the 4-year time limit which applies to claiming tax reliefs.  The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course per academic year. A disregard amount per claim is applied which is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course(s) and &euro;1,500 for a part time course(s). One disregard amount applies to each claim. Full details of the relief, including the terms and conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/index.aspx  .</p><p>Further reliefs may arise where eligibility for specific relief(s) from income tax depends on the circumstances of the individual claimant. </p><p><i><i>Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit</i></i></p><p>The single person child carer tax credit is available to a &lsquo;single person&rsquo; who has a qualifying child residing with him or her for the whole or greater part of the year of assessment. </p><p>A single person, for the purposes of this tax credit, is an individual who is not jointly assessed for tax as a married person or civil partner, living with his or her spouse or civil partner, or cohabiting with a partner.</p><p>A qualifying child includes:</p><p>- a child who was born in the tax year;</p><p>- a child who was under the age of 18 at the start of the tax year;</p><p>- an individual who is over the age of 18 at the start of the tax year if he or she is either in full-time education or permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining themselves; or</p><p>- a permanently incapacitated individual who is over the age of 21, if he or she became permanently incapacitated before reaching the age of 21 or while in full-time education.</p><p>As noted above, the qualifying child must be resident with the claimant for the whole or greater part of the year of assessment. The greater part of the year of assessment is taken to be a period greater than six months. </p><p>However, where a child is in receipt of full-time education and is required to live away from home during term time, the child may be deemed to be resident with the claimant for the purposes of the credit. Full-time education includes all primary degrees and diplomas undertaken in public and private educational establishments where the course is for one year or more. It also includes programmes of training for any trade or profession (apprenticeships) where the child is required to devote the whole of his or her time to the training for a period of not less than 2 years. </p><p><i><i>Widowed Parent Tax Credit</i></i></p><p>The widowed parent tax credit may be available to a surviving spouse or civil partner in each of the five years following the year of bereavement.</p><p>The credit will be available where the surviving spouse or civil parent has not married, remarried,  entered into a civil partnership or entered into a cohabiting relationship and has a qualifying child residing with him or her for the whole or part of the year. </p><p>A qualifying child, for the purposes of the widowed parent tax credit, will be determined on the same basis as for the single person child carer tax credit.</p><p>Finally, it is not clear from the information provided whether the Irish resident individual has entered a maintenance agreement with a former spouse or civil partner.  Maintenance payments which are specifically for the benefit of a child or children may be payable on foot of a maintenance agreement or an order of the Court. Such payments are ignored for income tax purposes and the paying party cannot claim an income tax deduction for these payments. The receiving party will not pay income tax, universal social charge or PRSI on payments received on behalf of any child or children.</p></reply>

However, gains from cryptocurrencies are not separately identified as an asset category on the relevant returns; as such, the information requested by the Deputy is not available.</p><p>Revenue considers cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to be digital assets. Revenue expects that the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies by an individual is normally an investment as opposed to a trading activity. As such, the tax treatment of the gains and losses arising from such an activity generally falls to be considered by reference to CGT, with gains arising on the disposals chargeable to CGT at 33%. A disposal can occur where a person:</p><p>- sells or gifts cryptocurrency,</p><p>- trades or exchanges cryptocurrency (including the disposal of one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency),</p><p>- converts cryptocurrency to fiat currency (a currency established by government regulation or law), such as Euro, or</p><p>- uses cryptocurrency to obtain goods or services.</p><p>Losses on the disposal of cryptocurrency investments are allowed as a deduction against other chargeable gains.  The first &euro;1,270 of chargeable gains of individuals in a tax year are exempt from CGT. </p><p>Where an individual buys and sells cryptocurrency assets in the course of a trade, rather than as an investment, they will be subject to income tax, PRSI and USC on any profits arising on the disposal of those assets.

In monitoring tax compliance, Revenue can scrutinise returns received to ensure they comply with legislative provisions.</p><p>Ireland is an active contributor to the ongoing work, at both EU and OECD levels, to develop tax reporting frameworks that will provide information to tax authorities on transactions involving crypto assets and e-money and has also been engaged in work to better understand how such transactions are treated for tax purposes in different jurisdictions.</p><p>Further guidance on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions can be found on the Revenue website in the Tax and Duty Manual. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.822.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500075#WRR01000"><p>Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.  In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The amount of VRT due or paid on a vehicle is remitted or repaid up to the maximum relief applicable (&euro;10,000 for VRT/VAT relief in most cases). As there is a separate VRT relief for electric vehicles provided for by Section 135C(3)(b) of the Finance Act 1992, the amount of VRT due or paid on an electric vehicle may be lower than the maximum relief permitted.

Gov.ie partially complies with the double-A WCAG 2.1 standards and the 4 principles of accessibility in that it is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. This is similar to most other government sites across the EU. One way in which accessibility is being improved is by improving the level of plain English used for services on the site to allow users of all levels to find and understand information as quickly as possible. The Gov.ie team have performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website has gone live and has engaged with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. This is an ongoing process. Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were fixed and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has since released updates to the core code of the site to improve accessibility. </p>  <p>  The following is the position in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department that are within the scope of Directive 2016/2102 (EU), as articulated in SI No. 358/2020:</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s accessibility statements for its websites are currently under review and will be updated later this year. The accessibility statement for the Bank&rsquo;s main website will be published later this month and this will include information on the areas of focus to ensure compliance. Statements for the remaining websites will follow. The Central Bank&rsquo;s main website is partially compliant with the harmonised European Standard Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services (based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1). The accessibility standard for the Bank&rsquo;s other websites is under review and a roadmap for enhancement is expected later this year.</p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has advised that its website accessibility statement will be published shortly. The Fiscal Council recognises the importance of ensuring that its website is accessible and ensures that its videos are subtitled, that images have alt text (a short written description of an image, which makes sense of that image when it can't be viewed) and that content on the website is machine readable so that it is compatible with immersive readers. It is committed to ensuring that its website continues to meet the basic four POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) in respect of accessibility and will draft future policies to ensure that this is achieved on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  While the current website of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) meets the majority of the Directive&rsquo;s requirements, the FSPO is developing a new website which will be based on the requirements of the Directive. The new website will include an Accessibility Statement, as outlined in S.I. No. 358/2020, confirming the FSPO&rsquo;s compliance with the regulations under the Directive, as well as details of a mechanism through which users can provide feedback on the accessibility of the FSPO&rsquo;s website/app.</p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) has advised that it is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive in respect of HBFI.ie. An Accessibility Statement can be found on the &lsquo;Legal&rsquo; section of its website under &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; outlining the steps taken in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal is currently working with an IT consultant to ensure that all content on its website is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive and expects to publish its accessibility statement in the near future.</p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has a statement of compliance which can be viewed under the &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; section of its website. While NAMA does not provide services to the public, it advises that it is committed to making the information on this website accessible to all in compliance with the Directive. </p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive in respect of its primary website. A programme of works is currently being undertaken in respect of secondary NTMA websites and, following same, all secondary websites will be in compliance with the Directive. The NTMA has an accessibility statement in place that can be found under the &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; section on its website and a contact mechanism is available in the event that content is not accessible, in line with Article 7 of the Web Accessibility Directive. The Accessibility Statement will be updated shortly to take account of outstanding requirements.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) is in compliance with the accessibility requirements of S.I. No. 358 of 2020. The Office is currently preparing an Accessibility Statement which will be available on its website soon. OCAG has taken measures to make the website more accessible, and thereby perceivable, operable, understandable and robust, through the installation of accessibility software. It has also engaged a specialist company to conduct an accessibility scan and assessment review of the website, in order to optimise its accessibility. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners maintains an Accessibility Statement on its website. In order to comply with Directive 2016/2102 (EU), its public-facing web-based systems and mobile app service are built to Level AA requirements based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Revenue has advised that it keeps all such services under review and addresses any accessibility issues identified as quickly as possible and ensures that new system enhancements and developments continue to meet the accessibility standards required.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has advised that it is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive and that an Accessibility Statement is available under the &lsquo;Disclaimer&rsquo; section on their website outlining the steps taken in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) is in the process of drafting an Accessibility Statement to meet its obligations and this will be published on its website soon. The TAC has currently adopted universal accessibility and the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) WCAG V2.0 Level AA in the design and development of its website. However, the Commission is currently redeveloping its website in the short and medium term and accessibility has been taken into account during the design process, as part of the providers&rsquo; commitments to the project. The new website is expected to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In 2020, a general government deficit of over &euro;18 billion was recorded. This is the equivalent of nearly 9 per cent of modified gross national income, or GNI*, or 5 per cent of GDP. For this year, the Stability Programme Update projected a deficit of another &euro;18 billion. </p>  <p>  Against this background, Budget 2021 still allocated &euro;3.1 billion towards housing, the highest level of funding ever committed. Total expenditure in this area has more than doubled since 2016 and is 41 per cent above the previous peak level in 2008. The capital spending on housing for 2021 is 26 per cent higher than the previous year, and almost two and a half times what it was in 2017, demonstrating the massive commitments Government has already made in the area of housing.</p>  <p>  While public investment has an obvious role in alleviating housing market pressures, there are also significant non-fiscal constraints. In particular, the public health measures needed to suppress Covid-19 have placed a direct restriction on the construction of new housing. The industry is now facing increased costs and difficulty sourcing building materials as a result of the pandemic, high international demand, and Brexit. There are also skills shortages within the construction sector, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades. As acknowledged in the report, simply increasing expenditure will not negate these capacity constraints.</p>  <p>  From a broader fiscal perspective, as we move beyond the extraordinary events of the pandemic, it is important to remember that it is neither sustainable nor prudent to run perpetual deficits. This fact is underlined by the European Commission&rsquo;s recent announcement that the General Escape Clause of the EU fiscal rules should not extend beyond 2022.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Government is determined to fulfil its Programme for Government commitments to increase the social housing stock by 50,000 during its term of office. While capital expenditure allocations are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department and I are in regular contact with our counterparts in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cabinet Committee on Housing and various other forums. Significant capital investment has been provided to ensure more people have access to quality, affordable housing. The Government will also publish its upcoming Housing for All Strategy later this summer, which will build on our commitments in the Programme for Government. However, we must also be cognisant of other, non-financial constraints on housing development and the need to ensure public investment is made in a sustainable manner.      </p></reply>

For the self-employed, the liabilities that may be warehoused (&ldquo;Covid-19 income tax&rdquo;) are the balance of self-assessed income tax, PRSI and USC for 2019 and preliminary tax, PRSI and USC for 2020, which were due to be paid on or before 31 October 2020, or 10 December 2020 where the individual filed electronically through ROS (&ldquo;Period 1&rdquo;); and, in certain circumstances, the balance of self-assessed income tax, PRSI and USC for 2020 and preliminary tax, PRSI and USC for 2021, which are due to be paid on or before 31 October 2021, or 17 November 2021 if filed electronically.  </p>  <p>  The legislation currently provides that &ldquo;Covid-19 income tax&rdquo; will be subject to no interest for a period of 12 months and 3% interest per annum thereafter until the liability is paid in full.  Where an individual is eligible to warehouse the balance of 2020 income tax, PRSI and USC and preliminary income tax, PRSI and USC for 2021, s/he can avail of 0% interest on the warehoused amounts for an additional 12 months.</p>  <p>  As part of the Economic Recovery Plan announced by the Government on 1 June, the debt warehousing scheme will be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers.  As a result, self-assessed income taxpayers who warehoused the balance of income tax for 2019 and preliminary tax 2020 will have an additional period of over 12 months, up to 31 December 2022, during which no repayment of the warehoused liabilities is required and no interest will accrue on those liabilities.  Such taxpayers will not be required to repay these liabilities until January 2023.  Interest at a reduced rate of c. 3% per annum will apply from that date. </p>  <p>  Where a self-assessed taxpayer is eligible to warehouse the balance of income tax for 2020 and preliminary tax 2021 (the liabilities due to be paid in October / November 2021), the extension will also suspend collection of these liabilities, interest-free, until 31 December 2022. </p>  <p>  Some self-employed taxpayers may be availing of the other warehousing schemes.  A similar extension is also proposed for the warehousing schemes for PAYE (Employer) liabilities, VAT and excess Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments.  Currently, the liabilities that can be warehoused are those relating to &ldquo;Period 1&rdquo;, the period in which the ability of a business to trade was restricted due to the impact of Covid-19.  The proposed extension of the scheme will allow business to warehouse additional liabilities for periods up to and including December 2021.  Collection of these liabilities will be suspended, interest-free, until 31 December 2022.  Repayments will commence with effect from 1 January 2023, at a reduced interest rate of c. 3% per annum. </p></reply>

Together with the wide range of other support measures that the Government is making available for businesses affected by the pandemic, the temporary low rate will assist the businesses over the initial stages of their recovery and help support jobs.  Given the many competing demands for publicly funded support, and in the context of future uncertainty, the measure is designed as a temporary change, with a sunset clause included in the enacting legislation.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that VAT is normally administered on a bi-monthly basis, with traders required to make returns and account for VAT 6 times per year:  in respect of January/February, March/April, May/June, July/August, September/October and November/December.  For ease of administration for traders, any changes to VAT rates are normally made at the end of one of these VAT periods.  This has informed the Government&rsquo;s approach in the present case.</p></reply>

The scheme is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D.  A qualifying business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to help traders meet their costs at a time when they cannot provide goods or services to their customers from their business premises, or can only do so to a limited extent, due to COVID-19 related restrictions. The legislation also provides that a claim for the CRSS can be made no later than eight weeks from the date on which the &lsquo;claim period&rsquo; commences. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question registered for the CRSS on 17 November 2020 and submitted its first claim on 4 December 2020 and correctly received payment for the &lsquo;claim period&rsquo; 19 October 2020 to 6 December 2020. The business did not submit another claim until 17 May 2021 and correctly received payment for the &lsquo;claim period&rsquo; 15 March 2021 to 16 May 2021.

I am aware that reports of this nature frequently refer to companies which were not Irish tax resident and as a result they were not subject to tax in Ireland. However taxation in other jurisdictions, in particular in the United States (US) following extensive tax reforms introduced there in 2017, is likely to have applied.</p>  <p>  The so-called &ldquo;Double Irish&rdquo; exploited the different definitions of corporate tax residency in Ireland and the United States (US) while taking advantage of certain provisions of US tax law that allowed for a deferral of US taxation. It involved the use of an Irish incorporated company which was not Irish tax resident under Irish corporate tax residence rules and hence not within the charge to Irish corporation tax. In this context, it should be noted that Irish corporate tax residence rules were similar to those in the OECD&rsquo;s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. </p>  <p>  In the absence of US reforms to address this issue, Ireland changed our corporate tax residence rules in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014. Thereafter, the US introduced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. It is my understanding that one of the anti-avoidance measures in that Act imposes a minimum tax rate on US multinational companies. The measure is referred to as &ldquo;GILTI&rdquo;, short for &ldquo;global intangible low-taxed income&rdquo;. It ensures that US multinationals pay tax on the income earned by US companies outside the US from intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The actions taken by the Irish and US governments have therefore eliminated or significantly reduced the tax benefits to multinationals of using this type of deferral structure. </p>  <p>  It is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has been an ongoing process since 2013. Ireland has very much played its part in reframing these rules for the benefit of business and citizens, and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with the new international norms.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce, in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to Income Tax, and is also a feature of other tax heads, such as Capital Acquisitions Tax. Therefore, any changes in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development more generally, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective. </p>  <p>  The arrangements and associated legislation for the purposes of payments or allowances under the remit of the Department of Social Protection in relation to married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and her Department. </p></reply>

The analysis highlights the advantages of the Irish system, in particular with regard to horizontal equity, by ensuring that those who receive the same amount of wealth pay the same amount of tax.  In this context, it is also important to consider that Ireland&rsquo;s CAT is much less generous with exemption thresholds than many other OECD countries, as CAT exemptions apply on a lifetime basis. </p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and more specifically the reference in the report to the Revised Entrepreneur Relief, I would refer to the external review by Indecon Consultants published as part of the Budget 2020 documentation. A number of possible modifications, amendments and potential improvements were suggested in respect of the relief. These recommendations are under continuous review through the annual Tax Strategy Group (TSG) and Budget process.</p>  <p>  Referring to the Principal Private Residence Relief, as the ESRI rightly point out, a removal of this relief could have a significant impact on 'lock-in' effects. Given the current economic impact of the pandemic, it is important to ensure CGT does not act as a barrier to the reallocation of firms and workers. </p>  <p>  As with all taxes, a low rate can be funded through a wide base, similarly a narrower base designed to encourage/reward certain behaviour through targeted reliefs requires a higher rate. My Department will continue to examine current reliefs to ensure the sustainability of revenue while balancing the need for targeted incentives and reliefs to address certain market failures through the annual budgetary cycle. </p></reply>

This definition includes tax expenditures such as tax rebates, tax repayments and reduced tax rates, as well as direct subsidies.</p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) Fossil Fuel Subsidies 2019 publication estimates total fossil fuel subsidies amounted to &euro;2.4 billion in 2019.   Direct fossil fuel subsidies accounted for 11% of total fossil fuel subsidies in 2019 while indirect subsidies arising from revenue foregone due to tax abatements accounted for 89%.  The CSO estimates that the largest of these reliefs was the exemption from excise and carbon taxes of jet kerosene used for commercial flights, costing &euro;634 million per year, while the lower rate of fuel duty applied to auto-diesel relative to petrol is estimated to amount to &euro;400 million per year.  The ESRI May 2021 Budget Perspectives Paper referenced by the Deputy refers to the possible removal of these reliefs and the potential additional revenue raised.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the exemption on aviation fuel for commercial flights,  the Deputy will be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s excise duty treatment of fuel used for air navigation is based on European law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive. Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty. The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes.  The Commission is working on a proposal to revise the ETD and it is expected that changes to the current fossil fuel related reliefs and exemptions will be proposed.   </p>  <p>  On a national level, it is recognised that gradual removal of fossil fuel subsidies will play an important role in phasing out reliance on fossil fuels in the transition to a low carbon economy.  To achieve this transition with minimum disruption, the Programme for Government commits to providing timely signposts as well as regulatory changes and incentives giving society and industry the chance to adapt.   </p>  <p>  As part of the annual budget process, the Tax Strategy Group will examine indirect environmental tax subsidies and examine options in this regard, having due regard to the EU legislative framework in this area.   </p></reply>

Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower, including the age of the borrower.  </p>  <p>  A regulated entity must also gather and record sufficient information from the consumer prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a product or service appropriate to that consumer. The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service being sought by the consumer, but must be to a level that allows the regulated entity to provide a professional service and must include details of the consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives, personal circumstances (including age where relevant) and their financial situation.</p>  <p>  Prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer, a lender must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the consumer&rsquo;s likely ability to repay the debt, over the duration of the agreement. A regulated entity must take account of the result of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.</p>  <p>  When assessing the suitability of a product or service for a consumer, the regulated entity must, at a minimum, consider and document whether, on the basis of the information gathered: </p>  <p>  - the product or service meets that consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives;</p>  <p>  - the consumer is likely to be able to meet the financial commitment associated with the product on an ongoing basis and is financially able to bear any risks attaching to the product or service;</p>  <p>  - the consumer has the ability to repay the debt in the manner required under the credit agreement, on the basis of the outcome of the assessment of affordability; and</p>  <p>  - the product or service is consistent with the consumer&rsquo;s attitude to risk.</p>  <p>  In addition, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of this consumer protection regulatory framework, it is then a commercial matter for each lender to determine its own lending policies and to make its own decisions on individual applications for credit.  However, if a loan applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

This framework has evolved significantly over the past two decades, particularly following the economic and financial crisis a decade ago, which saw the rules strengthened through the adoption of the so-called Six- and Two-pack legislative packages. Early last year, the European Commission presented a formal review of the Six- and Two-pack, including the launch of a public consultation on the operation of the fiscal rules. Discussions around this review were paused to allow Member States to address the immediate challenges of the pandemic, with the public consultation suspended.</p>  <p>  While compliance with the fiscal rules had improved across all Member States pre-pandemic, the rules have become increasingly complex over time. Thus, I believe it is necessary to discuss potential options that could improve the fiscal governance framework. In particular, I support efforts to improve the transparency, predictability and simplicity of the fiscal rules.  While some flexibility is needed in the rules to respond to economic circumstances that are genuinely beyond the control of Member States, as evidenced by the application of the General Escape Clause in response to the pandemic, it is equally important to ensure that the rules are enforced consistently. The current rules&rsquo; reliance on unobservable variables such as the output gap, which directly affects the structural balance, also impacts the reliability and communicability of the framework. My Department has previously highlighted this on several occasions. </p>  <p>In relation to the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation it is important to note the Commission&rsquo;s intention, as set out in the Communication of March 3rd on the fiscal policy response to the pandemic, to relaunch the public debate on the economic governance framework once economic recovery takes hold. I fully support this position and welcome the planned resumption of the public consultation once economic conditions allow. My officials and I will continue to actively engage in discussions in this area at the European level.</p></reply>

Insurers in many countries appear to have tightened their policy terms, increased premiums and overall seem more reluctant to underwrite the same level of risk as before. Events in recent years such as the Grenfell fire (particularly in relation to construction related PI insurance cover), Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the market, particularly in Ireland, where a significant level of specialised cover has been provided by UK underwriters.</p><p>In light of the concerns felt by many groups, particularly businesses, around the cost and availability of insurance, the Government has prioritised reform of the insurance environment. The <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>therefore sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations.</p><p>I would note that significant progress has been made to date on the implementation of these key reform including the establishment of the new <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>within my Department. In his capacity as the Chair of the Office, Minister of State Fleming has held number of bilateral meetings with major insurers on a wide range of issues The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers, and to understand the trends in the market as a whole. It is also involved with bodies such as the IDA in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance, including specialised cover in areas such as PI insurance. Minister Fleming will continue to update the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform on the Office&rsquo;s work progress.</p><p>In conclusion, while the issues that have contributed to the hardening of the Professional Indemnity insurance market are international in origin, it is my firm belief that implementation of the Action Plan should assist in attracting such insurers into the Irish insurance market when it begins to improve again, including in the construction sector. </p></reply>

However, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) reports that research from both the United States and Europe suggests that foreign direct investment (FDI) and the decisions of multinationals to locate in Ireland are highly sensitive to rates of corporation tax. Therefore, increasing the corporation tax rate would likely lead to lower levels of economic activity, behavioural changes in the locational decisions of multinational companies and employment in the multinational sector. As a result of the difficulty of predicting and quantifying these impacts, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not possible to accurately or robustly estimate the potential yield from the increases proposed by the Deputy. I would note however that ESRI research in 2011 estimated that <i>reducing</i>Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate from 40% in 1994 to 12.5% in 2003 added almost 4% to the level of economic output in 2005 and around &euro;2 billion in corporation tax revenues.  </p><p>Furthermore, while corporation tax is statutorily levied on the profits of businesses, the ESRI states that researchers have concluded that a large share of the burden is likely to be borne by workers in the form of lower wages. This can arise from companies deciding to invest less, leading to lower capital and lower labour productivity and wages. As the ESRI found that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) predominantly finance their investments in fixed assets, intangible assets and staff through internal funds, raising the rate of corporation tax would hamper their ability to invest and grow. </p></reply>

However, before introducing such a tax it is of course important to have  a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant dwellings, and the reasons why they are vacant.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, in 2018 I commissioned a study on the potential of a vacant residential property tax to meet the objective of increasing the supply of homes. The resulting report presented a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.  The report did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax as it considered it would not be an effective response to deal with the housing challenges. The very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium term vacancy, indicated that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of private sector supply.  In their report Indecon stated that while such a tax would be likely to generate significant media and public attention and may be seen as part of an effective response to our housing problems, they did not believe that this would be supported by the evidence in their report. </p>  <p>  The report recommended that the matter be kept under review and this remains the position. </p></reply>

Such a decision would be at the discretion of the individual firm. The Minister for Finance has no role in the individual commercial decisions of brokers in this regard. The Central Bank of Ireland also cannot get involved in the commercial decisions of firms, other than to ensure that firms comply with the appropriate rules and regulations and particularly the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that provision 4.13 of the Code sets out the minimum information that must be included in a regulated entity&rsquo;s terms of business such as a general statement of the charges imposed directly by the regulated entity. Provision 4.54 of the Code states that prior to providing a service the entity must provide the consumer with a breakdown of ascertained charges that will be passed on to the consumer. Additionally, under Provision 4.55 of the Code, brokers are required to publicly display their fees and charges in a manner that is easily accessible to consumers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that in September 2019 the Central Bank published changes to the Consumer Protection Code 2012 to ensure transparency of commission arrangements and to minimise the risk of conflicts of interest relating to commissions arising where consumers are receiving financial advice from a retail intermediary. These changes took effect on 31 March 2020. Further detail on the new rules on commission arrangements can be found on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website - www.centralbank.ie/news-media/press-releases/press-release-intermediary-commissions-25-sept-2019</p>  <p>  Finally, if a consumer is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the consumer on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile components of energy and unprocessed food, fell by -0.1 per cent in 2020.</p>  <p>  While inflation remained relatively subdued in the first quarter of 2021, both core and headline HICP have since picked up, due to a number of temporary and one off factors including the reweighting of the HICP basket, a reversal of the temporary VAT cut and the recovery in oil prices. </p>  <p>  In May, headline HICP increased by 1.9 per cent on an annual basis &ndash; the highest annual rate since October 2012. Core inflation also increased sharply, up 1.2 per cent on an annual basis.  The increase in the headline rate of inflation in May was driven largely by energy inflation, which grew by almost 12 &frac12; per cent on an annual basis due to base effects from the collapse in oil prices last spring. </p>  <p>  The uptick in inflation since the beginning of this year is broadly in line with international price developments. In May, headline HICP in the euro area increased by 2 per cent on an annual basis, while core inflation increased by 0.9 per cent. More generally, in the US and other advanced economies, consumer prices have risen recently partly due to temporary factors including; oil prices, increased global shipping costs and semi-conductor prices. Additionally, consumer price inflation in many economies has been boosted by increasing demand as economies open up, very accommodative monetary policies and extraordinary fiscal supports.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, inflation in Ireland is expected to continue to pick up over the course of this year due to these temporary and one-off factors but also as demand recovers in line with the easing of restrictions and re-opening of the economy. Whether or not this recent increase in inflation proves to be temporary or more sustained is something my Department is closely monitoring. </p></reply>

Strong economic growth had been recorded for a number of years, the labour market was close to full employment, and surpluses had been recorded on the current account and the government budget balance.  </p>  <p>  The outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis turned the economy on its head and resulted in a sharp contraction of domestic economic activity last year and into the first quarter this year. My Department projected modified domestic demand growth of 2&frac12; per cent for this year and 7&frac12; per cent for 2022 in the April Stability Programme Update. It is anticipated that as the reopening progresses, the release of pent-up demand financed by the unwinding of historically high household savings will support the recovery. </p>  <p>  While the domestic sector suffered a hit last year, the multinational sector has proven resilient, demonstrating the competitiveness of Irish exports in international markets. The outlook for Irish exports in light of strengthening global demand is very positive and Ireland&rsquo;s modified current account, which strips out the effects of globalisation, is projected to remain in surplus in the medium term. This reflects Ireland&rsquo;s continuing competitiveness on the international stage, for both indigenous and multinational exports. Looking to the future, our talented and flexible workforce, our track record as a successful place to do business, and our pro-enterprise environment mean that our economy&rsquo;s long-term fundamentals remain strong.</p>  <p>  As the global economy has experienced the shock of the Covid-19 crisis in a reasonably symmetric way, Ireland&rsquo;s economic fundamentals remain healthy and relatively strong in an international context. Unavoidable consequences of the pandemic and the associated necessary policy supports put in place, such as the increases in unemployment and public debt, have been shared international experiences. These imbalances are expected to moderate as the economic recovery takes hold. </p>  <p>  The strength and resilience of the Irish economy lies in its openness to international trade and investment. Nonetheless as a small open economy, Ireland is more exposed to external risks, including the international path of the virus, the extent of permanent damage to the global economy, and potential changes to the international tax environment. External risks continue to be monitored closely by my Department. </p></reply>

This support has included low interest rates, extensive asset purchases, and various refinancing operations, all of which have led to favourable financing conditions. This in turn has supported bank lending to firms and households, and has made it easier for people and companies to borrow funds. It has also lowered the burden of debt for eurozone countries, facilitating the substantial fiscal support governments have provided to cushion the impact of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  As the economy recovers and economic conditions begin to normalise, the exceptional monetary policy supports in place will need to be gradually withdrawn. However, a sudden and premature tightening of monetary policy could have adverse effects, threatening financial stability, increasing debt service costs and leading to a weaker-than-anticipated recovery. This possibility was one of the key downside risks set out in the Stability Programme Update published by my Department in April. </p>  <p>  However, the ECB&rsquo;s position is that the highly accommodative monetary policy continues to be necessary to support the burgeoning economic recovery. The ECB has also made it clear that advanced notice and clear communication of the path ahead will precede any tightening of monetary policy. This will help to avoid negative reactions from the market when monetary policy begins to normalise.</p></reply>

However, the new agreement still represents a break from previously existing arrangements, and thus a permanent shock to the Irish economy. Therefore, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards compared to the previous relationship.</p><p>Effective implementation of the TCA is a priority. Ireland, as part of the EU, will play our full part in realising the full potential of TCA for citizens and businesses. The EU continues to engage intensively with the UK to find solutions to the difficulties following Brexit, including implementation of the Ireland Northern  Ireland Protocol, which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, avoids a hard border and protects the Single Market, and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  </p><p>I remain satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit has been well-managed.  We have invested significantly in new infrastructure, systems and staff,  and provided a range of supports to assist businesses. We have also continued to engage intensively with stakeholders. </p><p>The Government has put in place extensive financial supports for sectors over recent years to assist businesses prepare for and mitigate the impacts of Brexit, including various financial, advisory, and upskilling supports. The Government has also invested heavily in our port infrastructure, as well as working closely with businesses to navigate the new customs arrangements.  A range of Government support is available to Irish exporters, including training and grants, to help businesses deal with these changes. It is vital that business prepare for the further changes which will arise over the coming months due to the UK&rsquo;s new import controls.</p><p>The successful negotiation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, delivered key economic objectives for Ireland. The Protocol secures Ireland&rsquo;s place within the Single Market, avoids a hard border on the island, protects the all-island economy, and provides Northern Ireland with unique access to both the British internal market and the EU single market.</p><p>In the months since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, a level of trade friction has been evident. Given the phased basis of the new import controls which are being applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. </p><p>The Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

Where mortgage borrowers are in financial distress, lenders must follow the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which aims to help borrowers address their financial payment difficulties with their lender quickly and effectively and get borrowers back on track with their mortgage obligations. The CCMA indicates that all such arrears or pre-arrears cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations. </p>  <p>  In relation to business customers and SME&rsquo;s that are in financial distress, lenders must follow the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Small and Medium Enterprise Regulations.  These Regulations place an obligation on lenders to assess each business&rsquo; financial circumstances with the objective being to assist that business to resolve its financial difficulties quickly and effectively, and to get the business back on track with its repayment obligations.</p>  <p>  Given the significant impact that Covid-19 has had on some businesses, the Central Bank has made clear to lenders (through its supervisory engagement) that it is critical for them to ensure there is efficient and targeted restructuring of SME liabilities in the near term, in order to ensure that viable businesses are supported and are placed on a sustainable footing. The Central Bank has advised that it has engaged with lenders to ensure they have strategies and plans for supporting viable SME borrowers that are experiencing short-term financial difficulty.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also emphasised the importance of borrowers engaging proactively with their lender noting that if a borrower is struggling to repay their debts due to COVID-19 or any other reason, the borrower should talk to their lender as soon as possible to find a sustainable solution and to retain access to protections some of which only apply if the borrower engages with their lender.</p></reply>

For example, credit institutions authorised in one EU Member State can, with minimal additional requirements, provide banking services in other EU states.  In addition, there have been developments, such as the Mortgage Credit Directive and the Consumer Credit Directive, which seek to promote a more harmonised market for the provision of credit to consumers across the EU.  However, this does not mean there will be a single price for any particular type of credit across the EU.  There are many factors, such as differences in national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, language, the proximity of lenders to borrowers, which will continue to inhibit the full integration of the market for mortgage and other consumer credit in the EU. More directly, differences in the nature of mortgage and other credit markets, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage and other credit will also impact on the levels of interest lending rates between and within different EU countries.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the general level of lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.  For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.8% at end-April 2021.</p>  <p>  However, as I have indicated on a number of occasions, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;</p>  <p>  - different cost-to-income ratios among banks;</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to mortgages, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  </p></reply>

As Minister for Finance one of my key concerns is to ensure that SMEs have access to sufficient liquidity, and that access to credit for SMEs is maintained. The Government has announced a range of measures to assist companies deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions. These include tax measures, as well as loan schemes made available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Microfinance Ireland to assist SMEs. Throughout the pandemic, the network of Local Enterprise Offices have continued to act as a point of contact for businesses around the country, and they can offer advice and support to small businesses, about how best to proceed and what supports are available to them, further information on COVID-19 supports available to SMEs can be found at enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/.  </p><p>In regard to lending to the various sectors of the economy, quarterly data are published by the Central Bank in respect of Irish bank lending to SME and large businesses, broken down by economic sector of activity of the business. Data for Q4-2020 can be found at www.centralbank.ie/statistics/data-and-analysis/credit-and-banking-statistics/sme-large-enterprise-credit-and-deposits.  The sectoral demand for credit from SMEs is also monitored in the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey. The Credit Demand Survey has consistently shown that whilst SME credit demand has been subdued in recent years the majority of loan applications are approved by banks.</p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks, however SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations centralbank.ie/news/article/regulations-for-firms-lending-to-smes-from-2016 set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers across all sectors.</p><p>  In addition, Credit Review www.creditreview.iewas established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers from all sectors that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>In terms of credit availability in Europe, the ECB publishes harmonised data on euro area lending to households and non-financial corporates every month, to the Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW), found at sdw.ecb.europa.eu/. Central Bank of Ireland commentary on developments in euro area credit can be found in the Central Bank&rsquo;s Financial Stability Review (FSR), which is published bi-annually www.centralbank.ie/publication/financial-stability-review  . </p></reply>

However, the new agreement still represents a break from previously existing arrangements.</p>  <p>  Effective implementation of the TCA is a priority. Ireland, as part of the EU, will play our full part in realising the full potential of TCA for citizens and businesses. The EU continues to engage intensively with the UK to find solutions to the difficulties following Brexit, including implementation of the Ireland Northern  Ireland Protocol, which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, avoids a hard border and protects the Single Market, and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  </p>  <p>  The net impact of Brexit on the policy areas within my remit is negative. The principal negative impact arises from the trade shock, which represents a permanent shock to the Irish economy, with a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards compared to the previous relationship.  In the weeks since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, a level of trade friction has been evident. Given the phased basis of the new import controls which are being applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. </p>  <p>  In the face of Brexit, the Government has been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy by developing and expanding our economic and trade relationships, both with our EU partners and with other overseas markets. The Mission Network abroad, in partnership with the State Agencies, are playing an important role in terms of public and economic diplomacy.</p>  <p>  This trade shock and associated economic impact will be mitigated somewhat by a positive Foreign Direct Investment shock resulting from a redirection to Ireland of investment from firms looking to relocate within the single market. The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector will change in a number of ways, and the sector is becoming broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time. The full impact of Brexit for Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector may not materialise for some years. </p>  <p>  The Government and various state agencies continue to implement &lsquo;Ireland for Finance&rsquo;, the strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector to 2025&rsquo;, and are working to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a leading financial services centre.</p>  <p>  In respect of the broader financial services sector, my Department has been working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), through the Financial Stability Group, and through the Brexit Contact Group, to limit the impact of key identified risks in the Irish financial system. This work and engagement has sought to ensure that the sector is adequately prepared, and that financial services firms and market participants have contingency plans in place to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that the financial services sector is well prepared and resilient enough to manage the changes associated with Brexit.  My Department, the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA will continue to monitor developments and activities in the financial sector in accordance with their respective responsibilities.</p></reply>

Modified Domestic Demand, which provides the best measure of domestic economic activity, fell by 5 per cent on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2021. This compares with a fall of 15&frac12; per cent in Q2 last year, with both of these &lsquo;covid quarters&rsquo; compared to non-covid quarters. Within this, consumer spending fell by 12 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, which compares to a fall of over 21 per cent during the first lockdown in the second quarter of 2020. Given that the level of stringency in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with that of the first lockdown last year and among the most stringent across advanced economies, these figures point to a weakening in the relationship between stringency and economic activity, and likely reflect adaptation by firms, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).</p>  <p>  In addition to our economy becoming more resilient, the vaccination programme is also having a positive effect. The number of Covid-19 infections have fallen by more than 90 per cent from the peak in January and the incidence among all age groups has declined. As a result of this progress, the Government began easing restrictions in April with a further relaxation of restrictions in May for sectors incorporating small and medium-sized enterprises in non-essential retail and personal services like hairdressers. </p>  <p>  In-line with this easing of restrictions the economy started to recover in the second quarter. Various indicators confirm this recovery including a range of business and consumer confidence indicators, daily card payment data, as well as May&rsquo;s tax receipts. Encouragingly an improvement in the labour market can also be seen from the PUP figures which have fallen from a high of 481,000 in February to 285,000 as of June 7th with further falls expected in the coming weeks. Alongside this recovery, many SME dominated sectors experienced significant declines in PUP numbers. Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade &amp;amp; Repair of Vehicles has fallen by 46 per cent from its peak in February, while over the same period, Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services are down 24 per cent and Arts, Entertainment &amp;amp; Recreation is down by 26 per cent.</p>  <p>  These developments are broadly in-line with my Department&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecasts in the Stability Programme Update, published in April. These forecasts assumed that the vaccine roll-out would ramp-up over the second quarter and accelerate thereafter. Wider vaccine coverage is still expected to allow for a further gradual relaxation of containment measures and a modest pick-up in economic activity, with the recovery gaining momentum from the summer onwards.</p></reply>

While much of the manufacturing sector remained open throughout the quarter, many domestic services activities were largely closed. As a result, the impact of these restrictions across sectors has been uneven. Gross Value Added (GVA) in manufacturing grew by around 13 per cent on a quarterly basis in the first quarter of 2021. In contrast, GVA in contact-intensive service sectors (which includes Distribution, Transport, Hotels and Restaurants and Arts, Entertainment and Other Services) declined by 9 per cent on a quarterly basis, with activity around 27 per cent below the pre-pandemic (Quarter 4-2019) level. </p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector has continued to perform strongly in recent months. Overall industrial Production in April remained above pre-pandemic levels. Crucially, production in the mainly indigenous &ldquo;traditional sector&rdquo;, which has a higher domestic value-added and is more labour-intensive than the modern sector of the economy, was also above its pre-pandemic level. Furthermore, the manufacturing PMI rose to the highest level on record in May as demand picked up following the re-opening of the economy, pointing to a further increase in manufacturing over the coming months.</p>  <p>  However, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on services activity. The CSO&rsquo;s Monthly Services Index fell by 0.5 per cent on a monthly basis in April, with overall activity around 3&frac12; per cent below the pre-pandemic (January 2020) level. Indeed, with the exception of ICT, the level of activity remained below the January 2020 level in all sectors in April. </p>  <p>However, the vaccination programme is now having a positive effect and the number of Covid-19 case numbers have fallen by more than 90 per cent from the peak in January and the incidence among all age groups has declined. As a result, the Government began easing restrictions in early April. This relaxation has recently gained pace allowing the economy to start to recover in the second quarter. In line with this, soft data point to a recovery of services activity with the services PMI reaching its highest level in over five years in May as pent-up demand was released following the initial easing of restrictions. A range of other indicators also confirm that an economic recovery is underway, including business and consumer confidence indicators, daily card payment data, as well as May&rsquo;s tax receipts. Furthermore, the National Economic Recovery Plan published on 1st June sets out how the Government will support the full resumption of economic activity, get people back to work and support those sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.969.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500077#WRT01800"><p>The Construction Sector Group (CSG), established in 2018 and chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, ensures regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector. Its remit includes, but is not limited to, considering opportunities to introduce reforms within the sector that will help in controlling construction price inflation. </p>  <p>  To support the work of the CSG, an annual "Build" Report was produced by my Department in 2019 and 2020. The purpose of this report is to give a comprehensive overview of the performance and prospects of the Irish construction sector, based on the available official statistics and data. The report aids in monitoring of trends across the sector, ranging from output and investment to employment and cost inflation, so that risks and performance issues can be identified and addressed where necessary.</p>  <p>  Inflation measures how much more expensive a set of goods and services becomes over a certain period of time. A number of measures relating to inflation in the Irish construction sector are detailed in the Build Report. The data included in the report is mostly obtained from the Central Statistics Office. </p>  <p>  Two major costs for the construction industry are the cost of materials and the cost of wages. </p>  <p>  Inflation in the cost of construction materials can be measured through the Wholesale Price Index. As for the wage inflation, this has been measured by monitoring average hourly earnings for the construction sector. </p>  <p>  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for Building and Construction Materials provides a general indication of price trends in the sector. WPI essentially measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk. In April 2021 the WPI for Building and Construction Materials stood at 3.4% on an annual basis. However within this there are certain materials which have seen elevated levels of inflation such as timber and steel.</p>  <p>  Average Hourly earnings for the construction sector (includes all employees of construction) increased by 9% between Q1 2020 and Q2 2021. </p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland Tender Price index reveals that national construction tender prices increased by 1.3% in the second half of 2020, up from 0.9% in the previous 6 months. The results indicate a slight rebound of tender price growth in the construction sector, with national annual inflation now at 2.2% (Jan 2020 to Dec 2020), however it is still significantly less than tender price inflation levels pre-Covid. The Index is the only independent assessment of construction tender prices in Ireland. It is compiled by the Quantity Surveying members of the Society. The Tender Price Index (TPI) is based largely on sentiment returns with actual tender returns included in the calculations. The TPI is for non-residential projects during the period in question. It is based on predominately new build projects with values in excess of &euro; 0.5m and covers all regions of Ireland. The Index relates to average price increases across differing project types and locations.</p>  <p>  Overall, while there was elevated construction sector inflation in 2019, construction price inflation has slowed overall in 2020 as a result of Covid-19. Elevated levels of inflation possesses risk for the construction sector and wider economy as a whole by undermining value for money. </p>  <p>  There are two primary channels through which inflation in the construction sector can be addressed; by reducing demand through lower levels of investment or by supporting the increase of supply.</p>  <p>  Industry is being supported by the Government to expand its capacity with three broad policies: communicating for industry confidence, securing the skills pipeline, and driving innovation. Specific actions include a new apprenticeship action plan, the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the funding and establishment of the Build Digital Project to drive digital adoption across the built environment sector and work by Enterprise Ireland to assess the potential for a Construction Technology Centre.</p></reply>

While delays arising from planning processes, with an associated impact on expenditure outturn, are not uncommon, three schemes in particular were significantly delayed, which then had a notable impact on the overall outturn on the Flood Risk Management Capital expenditure profile.</p><p>Transposition of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive 014/52/EU into Irish law took some time before final implementation.  Once transposed through the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was accordingly required to undertake an independent assessment of the various environmental reports for schemes submitted for consent under the Arterial Drainage Acts. Both the transposition, and the resultant requirements thereof, impacted on the time taken for consent to be given for flood relief schemes in Blackpool and Glashaboy. The anticipated start of construction works was not possible in 2019 as a result.</p><p>The Lower Morell Flood Relief Scheme, being progressed by Kildare County Council, was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning and Development Acts in April 2018, at which point construction was expected to commence. However, a Judicial Review was instigated by a local landowner and this prevented any construction works from being undertaken in 2019.</p><p>The impacts on the outturn on the 2019 Vote from the above schemes are set out below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Project/Programme</th>       <th>Initial   Profile</th>       <th>Outturn   (rounded)</th>       <th>Underspend   (rounded)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Glashaboy FRS</td>       <td>&euro;3m</td>       <td>&euro;0.5m</td>       <td>&euro;2.5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blackpool FRS</td>       <td>&euro;3m</td>       <td>Nil</td>       <td>&euro;3m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lower Morell FRS</td>       <td>&euro;1.7m</td>       <td>&euro;0.4m</td>       <td>&euro;1.3m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The issue on the Lower Morell Scheme was eventually resolved in 2020 and works commenced in 2020. The Glashaboy and Blackpool schemes were subsequently confirmed under the Arterial Drainage Acts earlier in 2021 and it is hoped that the Glashaboy Scheme will commence construction in the next seven months, following a tender process for a contractor. An application for Leave to take a Judicial Review of the Minister&rsquo;s decision on the Blackpool scheme has just been lodged, so it is not possible to say when this scheme will be progressed.</p><p>In addition to flood relief schemes above being delayed due to planning difficulties, there were a number of other flood relief schemes where construction works were slightly delayed due to a variety of issues. These included schemes in Douglas, Co. Cork, Sandymount in Dublin and Enniscorthy, Co Wexford. Expenditure on these schemes was approximately &euro;5m behind schedule in 2019.</p><p>The application process for the Voluntary Home Relocation Scheme did not progress in line with expectations, resulting in only &euro;0.5m of a projected &euro;3m being spent in 2019. </p></reply>

This is with the aim of developing a sustainable Irish agricultural sector that protects the environment and aligns with emerging consumer sentiment, while benefiting farmers and rural communities. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the allocation of &euro;1.5bn in projected carbon tax receipts over the next ten years for this purpose. The first step in meeting this commitment was in Budget 2021 through the allocation of &euro;20m in anticipated additional carbon tax receipts for the creation of pilot environmental programmes. This was supplemented with the continuation of the &euro;3m in funding that was provided for agricultural programmes from carbon tax receipts in 2020, bringing the total funding for carbon tax supported measures in the agricultural sector to &euro;23m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  These funds are being used to create and operate the Results Based Environment Agri Pilot Programme or REAP scheme. Farmers in this scheme will be rewarded for their environmental services including improving biodiversity, water quality, soil health, and sequestering carbon. Payments will be linked to the quality of environmental outcomes delivered. </p>  <p>  The use of carbon funds in 2021 was detailed in the Budget Day publication "The Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2021" which continues to be available on the budget.gov.ie website. Carbon tax funding in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is allocated to a specific sub-head, B.13, against which progress on spending the allocated funds can be tracked.  </p>  <p>  Questions regarding the operational details of the pilot programmes should be directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  </p></reply>

In addition, no fees are charged in cases where an individual makes a request for their own personal information, including applications for internal reviews or reviews by the Information Commissioner on decisions relating to personal information.  </p>  <p>  Where a request is for non-personal information, and the public body estimates that a significant amount of search and retrieval work will be required, a fee may apply.  This is calculated at a rate that is fixed in law, and the requester will be given an opportunity to assess the fee, pay a deposit, or potentially focus their request in order to reduce the amount of work that will be involved.  Where an individual believes that an estimated search and retrieval fee is unjustified or unjustifiably high, they may seek a review within the organisation concerned, and potentially by the Information Commissioner.  No fee would apply to such a review.</p>  <p>  However, where a review is sought of a substantive FOI decision to grant or refuse access to records which are not the personal information of the requester may attract fees of &euro;30 and &euro;50 where reviews are sought by internally and by the Information Commissioner respectively.</p>  <p>  While statistics are not collated for the proportion of requests where search and retrieval fees are charged, in most given years about 60% of requests are for personal information, where no fee whatsoever applies, and an internal review is sought in only about 3% of cases, with no application fees applying to the remainder.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific question, there are no exceptions from fees under the legislation relating specifically to requests from TDs.  Therefore, in general, FOI charges, should they arise, would apply in the normal way, as they would to any other individual.  However, as outlined above, in the majority of cases processed by public bodies in a given year, no fee will in any case have been charged. </p></reply>

All remaining Government Departments will be moved to gov.ie by the end of August 2021. </p><p>Gov.ie is the main Government website and recorded over 122 million page views in 2020.  Gov.ie partially complies with the double-A Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards and the 4 principles of accessibility in that it is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. This is similar to most other government sites across the EU. Accessibility to gov.ie is being enhanced by improving the level of Plain English used for services on the site. This allows users of all levels to be able to find and understand information as quickly as possible. In addition, the gov.ie team have continuously performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website went live. The gov.ie team has engaged with and continues to engage with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were identified and action taken to rectify and resolve these issues. In addition, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) has since released updates to the core code of the gov.ie website to improve accessibility. </p><p>All other sites managed by OGCIO are currently being moved to a new Content Management System which has been built with WCAG compatibility in mind. This project is ongoing with satisfactory progress being made this year.  </p><p>The position in relation to the bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out below.</p><p><b><i>Office of Public Works (OPW)</i></b></p><p>The OPW is committed to improving accessibility on its websites and mobile platforms. It is currently undertaking a review process to identify what work needs to be done to meet the relevant accessibility standards. An internal working group has been established and will oversee the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review.</p><p><b><i>National Shared Services Office (NSSO)</i></b></p><p>Compliance with directive 2016/2102 (EU) is stipulated in all NSSO procurements done in co-operation with the Office of Government Procurement.  The procurement of all new NSSO web applications and apps must conform to the current regulations in force. For legacy applications, every effort is made to retrofit functionality to ensure compliance with the regulations. Due to the age of some of the NSSO legacy systems, this is not always possible.</p><p><b><i>Public Appointments Service (PAS)</i></b></p><p>The PAS website accessibility statement can be found at: www.publicjobs.ie/en/accessibility. The PAS undertook a web accessibility audit in August 2020 working with an expert in this field to identify areas for potential improvement in accessibility across its website platforms. The remediation of those issues began immediately with a significant improvement in compliance with the web accessibility directive implemented throughout 2020 and 2021 to date. Some areas are still in progress for improvement, namely branding and legacy systems, which are road mapped to be addressed throughout 2021 and through the wider organisational digital transformation goals.</p><p><b><i>Office of the Ombudsman</i></b></p><p>All of the Office of the Ombudsman websites contain Website Accessibility Statements. The Office of the Ombudsman aims to ensure that the site meets the following technical standards:</p><p>- Accessibility - the Office aims to maintain every page of our site at WAI AA compliance level;</p><p>- Code - The site is produced using W3C XHTML 1.0 for code clarity; and</p><p>- Formatting - In line with W3C recommendations, all formatting is in a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file. Users may choose to disable this file and see a &quot;plain text&quot; version of the site if they prefer.</p><p><b><i>State Laboratory</i></b></p><p>The State Laboratory is currently not in compliance with the directive 2016/2102 (EU). A review plan is being currently being drafted and work to identify non-compliance in the website will start thereafter. Following this, remediation work to be scheduled and follow up periodic reviews of the website will be undertaken to ensure compliance with the directive.</p><p><b><i>Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery (ORNL)</i></b></p><p>Having considered S.I. 358/2020 (the &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo;), Directive 2016/2102, and official (National Disability Authority) and non-official commentary, the view of the ORNL is that the Regulations do not apply to the ORNL.  For completeness, the ORNL highlight that its has features to assist users who are vision impaired.  The Office&rsquo;s Custom Service Charter sets out its commitment to ensuring the accessibility of the Office and its work to people with disabilities, and the ORNL follow the National Disability Authority&rsquo;s plain English guidance in Annual Reports and other documents. </p></reply>

Employers will need to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. Departments should review their risk assessments to decide whether the employee can carry out the work task without vaccination and what other protective measures may be needed.  </p>  <p>  The current Public Health advice is that all existing infection prevention and control measures, (such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, face coverings, adequate ventilation), and working from home unless an employee&rsquo;s physical presence in the workplace is necessary, must also remain in place for individuals even following their vaccination. </p></reply>

In certain settings, such as live performances, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity or require them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.  Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.  Accordingly the existing Government decision remains in place that no live or loud music is permitted.  As the Deputy is aware, Government will be reviewing COVID restrictions at the end of the month and again in July and Cabinethas agreed to my request that restrictions on performances at licensed venues, such as restaurants, pubs and hotels, will be reviewed as a priority. </p>  <p>  On Friday May 28th the Government agreed pilot events will take place in June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the Arts Council and a number of stakeholder engagement structures in place to support the development and delivery of those pilot events.

Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities and in order to evaluate and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors. </p></reply>

Expenditure across all programme areas is monitored closely on an ongoing basis and at present, no overall savings are anticipated.</p><p>The total allocation to the Arts Council in the 2021 Revised Estimates Volume is &euro;130m which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. All of the funding allocated in 2021 is expected to be spent by 31 December 2021 and there are no plans to carry any amounts forward to 2022.  The Arts Council announced details of its  investment  plans  last February and this included a range of  initiatives as follows:-</p><p>- Strategic Funding to over 100 key arts organisations across the country, (Dublin&rsquo;s Abbey Theatre, the Irish Chamber Orchestra in Limerick, Macnas in Galway);</p><p>- Arts Centres funding to up 43 arts centres nationwide (An Grian&aacute;n in Donegal , Garage Theatre in Monaghan, Dunamaise, Co Laois)</p><p>- Funding to arts organisations under Arts Grant Funding programme;</p><p>- Festivals Investment Scheme;</p><p>- Bursaries for individual artists</p><p>- Additional funding for commissions and projects.</p><p>- New Agility Award</p><p>- Creative Schools&rsquo; programme with over 150 schools participating </p><p>Further details of these investment plans can be accessed at the following link </p><p>In terms of Screen Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in the cultural sectors are guided by &lsquo;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027&rsquo;.  The total allocation to Screen Ireland in the 2021 Revised Estimates Volume is &euro;30.093m.  While this is an increase of &euro;9.027m on the original 2020 allocation, it represents an increase of &euro;6.027m on the final 2020 allocation due to an additional amount allocated by Supplementary Estimate in autumn 2020.  All of the funding allocated in 2021 is expected to be spent by 31 December 2021 and there are no plans to carry any amounts forward to 2022. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021 an allocation of &euro;8m has been made to the National Concert Hall to allow for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra from RT&Eacute;.  While the transfer of the NSO has not yet been completed, it is intended that the transfer of the orchestra will be completed as early as possible in 2021. In terms of all additional funding allocated to the National Cultural Institutions as part of Budget 2021, it is expected that this additional allocation, which is independent of Covid-19 specific funding, will be expended by the end of the year.</p></reply>

There was a high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications received by the closing date of 14 April.  The assessment of applications has now finished and applicants have been notified of the outcome of their applications. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;14m is been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  </p>  <p>  This scheme sees support offered by way of three levels of once-off flat payments;</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;</p>  <p>  - &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply.  This scheme is now receiving application following wide consultation with the sector and applications are being received and processed. Further details in relation to this scheme, including guidelines and the application portal can be found on my department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/en/service/3cc71-music-and-entertainment-business-assistance-scheme/.</p>  <p>  All local authorities have received allocations under the Local Live Performance Programming Scheme sharing an allocation of &euro;5 million for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by all local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. </p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p>  <p>  Funding allocations for the above schemes will be spent before the end of this year and it is not planned to carry any funding into 2022.

The Economic Recovery Plan responds to the commitments made in the Programme for Government in charting a path to recovery from the challenge of COVID-19.</p><p>Under the <i>Economic Recovery Plan</i>, Government extended the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including Tourism, Arts and Culture, Sport, Media and those working in Gaeltacht communities. </p><p>- Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). Revisions will see payments for businesses reopening of up to &euro;30,000.</p><p>- Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December.</p><p>- Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021.</p><p>- Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021.</p><p>- Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.</p><p>- The ERP sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p><p>In addition to horizontal supports, the <i>Economic Recovery Plan</i>includes a package of sectoral supports for the Tourism, Live Events and the Arts and Culture.</p><p>For the live events, arts and culture sectors, I opened applications for the new &euro;14 million Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme last week, on 9 June. This payment is targeted at helping not only bands and musicians, but suppliers and music businesses. I also recently announced 237 grant allocations under the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme. </p><p>A separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events has been agreed between myself and the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar. This <i>Events Sector Covid Support Scheme </i>will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.</p><p>I am also delighted that the National Economic Recovery Plan includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, and I will bring forward a proposal following the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Oversight Group in July.</p><p>I also recently confirmed the release of funding for local authorities with &euro;5m to support live music in villages and towns across the country. Amounts of &euro;285,000 are now available to the Dublin local authorities, and &euro;143,000 to other local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances over the summer months, animating town centres for local communities as public health considerations permit. Local Authorities and hospitality businesses can also benefit from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Outdoor Dining Enhancement Investment Scheme, which will facilitate?greater capacity in?outdoor dining?by supporting the upgrade and enhancement of streets and public spaces, and implementing weather-proofing solutions which will facilitate year-round outdoor dining.</p><p>In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides the following additional interventions for the Tourism sector:</p><p>- An Extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022. This will continue to act as a stimulus for the sector as it moves towards recovery.</p><p>- The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity Scheme, which will continue to support businesses not covered by the CRSS.</p><p>- An extension of the commercial rates waiver to September 2021.</p><p>This will provide tourism and hospitality businesses with much-need clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings. Government also recognises that as long as physical distancing remains a public health requirement, further supports may be needed for these sectors.</p><p>These supports will augment the work already being undertaken by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and Screen Ireland in supporting Gaeltacht companies, the Tourism and Hospitality sector, and the audiovisual industry to withstand the full impact of the pandemic and position them for growth in the coming years.</p><p>I will continue to work with colleagues across Government to ensure that the sectors covered by my Department are supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.</p></reply>

It is a Programme, rather than an agency and its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>While creativity is commonly associated with the arts, it is considered more widely in the context of the Creative Ireland Programme.  Creativity is the use of imaginative abilities and learned skills to transform thinking and produce original and innovative ideas and solutions.  It involves collaboration, investigation, challenging assumptions and taking risks.  There are opportunities for creativity to be expressed not only through the visual and performing arts but <i>inter alia</i>through culture, built and natural heritage, writing and learning languages, through mathematics, sciences and digital technology, and in designing, making and entrepreneurial activities.</p><p>In striving to mainstream creativity across public policy therefore, substantial strategic engagement is required on an ongoing basis between the officials in my department delivering the Creative Ireland Programme and their counterparts across relevant government departments.  In so doing, the Creative Ireland Programme seeks to support each citizen &ndash; whether individually or collectively &ndash; to realise their full creative potential, by encouraging, facilitating and supporting collaboration in order to cultivate a diverse, accessible and creative cultural ecosystem that sustains wellbeing for all.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme focuses on supporting direct engagement with all forms of arts, culture and heritage-based creativity (e.g., in education, institutions, industry, and communities). As a legacy of the 2016 Commemorations experience, the Programme also promotes the deployment of creativity as a way of engaging with broader societal issues (e.g., health and wellbeing, social cohesion and inclusion, integration and intercultural dialogue, climate action, biodiversity loss).</p><p>The Arts Council is a statutory body under the aegis of my department established under the Arts Act 2003. The Council&rsquo;s statutory functions are to:</p><p>a. stimulate public interest in the arts;</p><p>b. promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;</p><p>c. assist in improving standards in the arts;</p><p>d. advise the Minister in relation to the performance of any of his or her functions under this Act, when so requested by the Minister;</p><p>e. assist the Minister in the performance of his or her functions under this Act and in the implementation of Government policies and objectives in relation to the arts, when so requested by the Minister;</p><p>f. furnish advice or information to a Minister of the Government (including the Minister) in relation to any matter connected with its functions, whenever the Council considers it appropriate or is requested to so do by the Minister;</p><p>g. furnish advice or information to a public body in relation to any matter connected with its functions, whenever the Council considers it appropriate or is requested to so do by the public body concerned; and</p><p>h. cooperate with a public body in relation to any matter connected with its functions, whenever the Council considers it appropriate.</p><p>As set out above, the core activities of the Arts Council are centred on stimulating public interest only in the art forms laid out in the Arts Act 2003, promoting knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts, improving standards in the arts and otherwise assisting in the development or advancement of the arts.  The Council is independent regarding the allocation of its funding to individuals and activities in the performance of these functions.</p><p>The Arts Council remains a key partner within the collaborative, all-of-government approach of the Creative Ireland Programme, in particular as the lead implementation partner for the Creative Schools initiative.  The Arts Council is also a partner in a Creative Ireland Programme initiative to develop and strengthen structures and mechanisms for collaboration between the arts, culture, social care and health sectors &ndash; aimed at supporting positive health and wellbeing outcomes for the public, health service staff, patients, their families and carers.</p><p>The collaborative nature of the work of the Creative Ireland Programme (involving partnerships between government departments, state agencies, local government, sectoral bodies and community and voluntary groups), the broader definition of creativity and the more wide-ranging scope of the Programme&rsquo;s activities including deploying creativity as a wellbeing strategy are key factors in a distinct Creative Ireland Programme initiative.</p></reply>

Ireland held the designation in 2020 and will not be due to be designated again until post 2033.</p>  <p>  It is the role of the State to facilitate the successful completion of the selection process. For example in the case of the 2020 designation, my Department completed this role by firstly launching the process six years in advance of the title year with an open call to local authorities seeking proposals from cities interested in being awarded the European Capital of Culture (ECOC) title. It then supported the independent panel of experts, appointed by the European Union Institutions, who assessed the applications, acting as liaison point between the panel and candidate cities and organising logistics for panel visits to the cities concerned. The applications for designation are generally local authority led and supported by local authority funding. </p>  <p>  Based on the recommendation of the independent expert panel, it is then the function of the State to designate the city to hold the title of European Capital of Culture. </p>  <p>  It is common practice for the State to provide financial support to the designated city.

In certain settings, such as weddings and live performances, higher noise levels due to music can force people into close proximity or require them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.  Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.  Accordingly the existing Government decision remains in place that no live or loud music is permitted.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Government will be reviewing COVID restrictions at the end of the month and again in July and Cabinet has agreed to my request that restrictions on performances at licensed venues, such as restaurants, pubs and hotels, will be reviewed as a priority. </p>  <p>  Since April, the Government has been delivering on a phased reopening of our economy and society.  The Government remains committed to this approach and has signalled further reopening in July and beyond.  Consideration of further reopening is subject to the prevailing public health situation, including the roll out of the vaccination programme. </p>  <p>  On Friday May 28th the Government agreed pilot events will take place in June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the Arts Council and a number of stakeholder engagement structures in place to support the development and delivery of those pilot events.  The first event took place in the Iveagh Gardens on the 10th of June in collaboration with the National Concert Hall and further events will take place across the course of the summer.</p>  <p>  These events will assist in safely charting a path back to greater levels of activity in line with developments in public health guidance over the coming weeks and months.  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities and in order to evaluate and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors.</p></reply>

Under this initiative, a range of Irish language courses, primarily in translation, interpreting and law, are provided, thus generating a supply of qualified people with Irish language skills to meet recruitment needs in Ireland and the EU.</p><p>In the 2019/20 academic year, funding of &euro;935,564 was disbursed in respect of the twelve courses funded under the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative and 86 students were awarded qualifications at the end of the same academic year. The courses are being run again this year with funding of &euro;970,953 being provided by my Department.</p><p>Alongside the above-mentioned specific fund, it should also be noted that my Department is also providing current funding of &euro;900,000 <i>per annum</i>to Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, NUI, Galway.  The Acadamh which operate under the aegis of NUI Galway, promotes the development and provision of university courses and research through the medium of Irish in three Gaeltacht centres and at the university&rsquo;s campus in Galway City.  My Department&rsquo;s allocation is earmarked to fund a range of courses through Irish, including a Gaeltacht semester and placement programme for students wishing to study Irish as part of their degree.</p><p>While my Department has for a number of years subsidised the accommodation costs for trainee teachers attending residential Gaeltacht courses, in 2019, it launched a new initiative, named Erasmus Gaeltachta, which provides up to 175 third-level students with the opportunity to spend a semester residing with accredited Gaeltacht households. This initiative is administered under my Department's <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>to subvent the cost of accommodation for students staying with Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme. It is expected that this will resume in the new academic year, having been cancelled over the past year due to the pandemic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-15a.1309.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500082#WRY05700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 540 and 541 together.</p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will, among other things, establish a regulatory framework for online safety to be overseen by an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider Media Commission. A foundational part of this framework will be the systems focused regulation of Video Sharing Platform Services required by the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</p>  <p>  The goal of the regulatory framework for online safety will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how regulated online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms. This is a risk based approach that is intended to drive towards the best possible outcomes for all users of online services.</p>  <p>  While there is an appreciation of the desire for an individual complaints mechanism, there are serious doubts about the effectiveness of a statutory mechanism of this kind in the online safety space. There are a number of reasons for this, including that:</p>  <p>- requirements for fair procedures would not facilitate a swift resolution of individual issues, as it would be necessary to engage with the uploader of content as well as the complainant;</p>  <p>- the volume of online content, particularly as Ireland will be regulating Video Sharing Platform Services for the whole of the EU population of 450 million people, would overwhelm even the best resourced regulator and divert resources away from regulatory oversight;</p>  <p>- referring complaints relating to individual items of content that are potentially criminal in nature to a civil regulator instead of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be appropriate; and</p>  <p>- it would incentivise regulated online services to refer matters to the regulator rather than to take responsibility for resolving the matter themselves.</p>  <p>  In light of this, the Bill provides the Commission with the power to oblige designated online services to have easy to use and effective complaints and appeals mechanisms in place and also the power to audit those mechanisms. This is part of the risk-based framework that will enable the Commission to seek the greatest degree of protection for all users through systemic oversight.</p>  <p>  Individuals will always be able to bring issues to the attention of the Commission and this will feed into the Commission's risk assessment and determination of audits and investigations. The Commission will also have the power to order the removal of individual items of content in certain discrete instances. However, this will not amount to a formal individual complaints mechanism. The Commission will also have a duty to promote independent mediation mechanisms and other methods of resolving disputes.</p>  <p>  The Commission will also be empowered to set up a systemic complaints scheme to receive complaints from nominated bodies such as expert NGOs about trends in the prevalence of harmful online content and the effectiveness of measures taken by regulated online services to comply with their obligations. This will help to inform the Commission about what the prominent and emerging risks are at any point in time and inform the Commission's approach to making online safety codes, conducting audits of complaints handling and investigating suspected failures of compliance.</p></reply>

The assessment of applications has now finished and applicants have been notified of the outcome of their applications. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. </p><p>An allocation of &euro;14m has been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports. </p><p>This scheme sees support offered by way of three levels of once-off flat payments;</p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;</p><p>- &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;</p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021</p><p>Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply.  This scheme is open for applications now following wide consultation with the sector and applications are being received and processed.

Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. </p><p>Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p></reply>

Since 2004, the RTB has replaced the courts in dealing with the majority of disputes between landlords and tenants through its Dispute Resolution Service. This service offers a choice of resolution types to parties &ndash; mediation or adjudication, with the option to appeal the outcome to a tenancy tribunal. </p>  <p>  The service provided by the RTB is quasi-judicial and all of their mediators, adjudicators and tribunal members have independent decision-making powers, in the same way as judges have within the Court system. To ensure impartiality, transparency and fairness, adjudicators are independently appointed and they undertake their functions in an autonomous capacity. </p>  <p>  Section 164 of the Residential Tenancies Acts governs the appointment or engagement of Mediators and Adjudicators.  It clearly states it is for the Board and the Board alone to appoint Mediators and Adjudicators. A recruitment process for new panel members has just completed and the RTB will be appointing new members to a panel of adjudicators and to a panel of mediators to perform the roles of Adjudicator and Mediator, as required, for a period of up to 5 years with discretion to extend this period if required. The RTB will appoint such numbers of adjudicators and mediators to the adjudicator and mediator panels as it believes appropriate having regard to the estimated need for adjudicators and mediators and the geographic distribution and location of cases that arise. </p>  <p>  These appointments will be made in accordance with the Order of Merit established of candidates who are deemed qualified following the selection process. As the need for additional adjudicator and mediator panel members arises, successful candidates will be drawn down from the Order of Merit in accordance with the ranking order and offered an appointment to the adjudicators and or mediators panel as appropriate.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2M Exchequer funding was secured in 2020 to reflect the expansion of the RTB&rsquo;s core functions as a result of new powers and functions conferred on the RTB in 2019 Act. In order to ensure that the RTB is fully resourced to deliver on its ever increasing mandate, I secured a further additional &euro;2M under the 2021 Estimates process to bring the RTB&rsquo;s Exchequer funding for operational costs in 2021 to &euro;11M.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the RTB to guarantee that it has the funds and staffing that is required to carry out its role as a regulator of the rental sector.</p></reply>

This is evident in the high number of HAP tenancies that have continued to be set-up.  </p><p>Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19 did, however, have an impact on processing times for HAP applications, particularly in Q2 2020 with an average processing time of 40 days at that time. By end Q1 2021 the average processing time had reduced to 35 days.  </p><p>The HAP application form comes in two parts, Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. </p><p>Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC. HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord may be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.</p><p>The HAP SSC manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP SSC within 2-3 working days of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p><p>Data on processing times is set out below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Q1 2020</th>       <th>Q2 2020</th>       <th>Q3 2020</th>       <th>Q4 2020</th>       <th>Q1 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average processing time</td>       <td><br /><br />35</td>       <td><br /><br />40</td>       <td><br /><br />38</td>       <td><br /><br />38</td>       <td><br /><br />35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of HAP tenancies processed (per   quarter)</td>       <td>3,942</td>       <td>3,883</td>       <td>4,062</td>       <td>3,998</td>       <td>3,914<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Through our ongoing engagement with local authorities my Department has stressed the need to minimise delays in processing these vital applications to ensure the social housing needs of tenants can be met through the HAP scheme where required. My Department is closely monitoring this situation and will continue to do so over the coming months.</p></reply>

However, in the context of, and in addition to, noise limits, they indicate - for the purpose of protecting residential dwellings in noise sensitive locations - an advisory minimum setback distance of 500m between each wind turbine and the nearest point of the curtilage of any residential property in the vicinity of the proposed development. In addition, environmental impact assessement and appropriate assessment requirements must also be considered on a case by case basis.</p><p>My Department is currently undertaking a focused review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines in line with the &ldquo;preferred draft approach&rdquo; which was announced in June 2017 by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/consultation/8f3c71-public-consultation-on-the-revised-wind-energy-development-guideline/ </i></p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are quite detailed and technical in nature.  My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) have analysed the submissions received including those relating to setback distances, in conjunction with the contracted SEA and noise consultants, and are in the process of preparing finalised guidelines having undertaken detailed consideration and analysis of the submissions received.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising the technical guidance on the noise aspect in conjunction with DECC (which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters). However, this piece of work is quite technical in nature and a small number of matters remain to be resolved in this regard.</p><p>Once the outstanding issues have been finalised by both Departments, the proposed amendments will need to be reviewed by the SEA consultants in order to conclude the SEA process.</p><p>My Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible. </p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr Denis McCarthy (former Chief Executive of Waterford Co Co) and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Their Report (available on the Departments webiste) was published on 13 June 2017. It concluded, inter alia, that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite. </p>  <p>  The panel estimated that the scale of the problem in Donegal as being between 1,200 to 4,800 private dwellings and 541 to 1,000 social housing dwellings. In the case of Mayo, the panel estimates that the minimum potential number of private dwellings likely to be affected is approximately 345 and a total of 17 social housing units across 3 estates are known to be affected.  </p>  <p>  Rigorous analysis therefore has already been carried out in relation to the construction of dwellings which are affected by the use of defective concrete blocks, with chapter three of the report specifically relating to building regulations and oversight. </p>  <p>  The resulting Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme was informed by the work of the Expert Panel and the current maximum grant amounts payable under the scheme were finalised in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process also took account of the comprehensive engagement that took place between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils, who operate and administer the scheme.</p>  <p>  The grant limits agreed on foot of this engagement ensures that the scheme can be budgeted for with the potential financial liability known at all times and also to ensure that the available budget can benefit the majority of properties and the maximum number of people.  </p>  <p>  In the first instance homeowners apply to the local authority seeking confirmation of eligibility for the scheme. As part of this application process, an approved engineers report in accordance with I.S. 465:2018 is required. The report confirms the existence or otherwise of excessive amounts of pyrite or mica in the blockwork which have given rise to defective concrete blocks and is based on a visual inspection, core sampling and laboratory testing which is carried out by the engineer employed by the homeowner. The cost of the report can vary from home to home but the scheme allows for recoupment of 90% of the cost to eligible applicants, subject to a maximum recoupment of &euro;6,300. I understand that feedback from homeowners who have been through the stage 1 process is that the costs allowable for stage 1 are in line with the costs being incurred. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage 433 stage one applications have been submitted and nearly 54% have been approved. </p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent legal entities whose purchasing activities are governed by public procurment rules. It would not be appropriate therefore for my Department to comment on the individual purchasing decisions of local authorities. </p>  <p>  Lastly, engagement between my Department, the local authorities and local action groups in relation to the scheme will continue.  In this regard, I have proposed a timebound working group, with representatives from my Department, the local authorities and homeowner representative groups, to review and address any outstanding issues in relation to the operation of the scheme, including issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering and allowable costs etc.  I propose that the recommendations of this working group will inform any changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required, which I will bring forward in conjunction with my Government colleagues, and in particular in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General.</p></reply>

I have also requested that the Expert Group consider the issues related to changing the bathing water season, taking into account the current review by the European Commission of the Bathing Water Directive.  </p>  <p>  The EPA as the environmental regulator makes sure that local authorities carry out their functions under the Bathing Water Regulations to monitor bathing waters, to warn of pollution events and to take action where there are water quality issues. The EPA share the latest information provided by local authorities with the public through www.beaches.ie.   I would encourage all bathers to use the information on this dedicated website before going swimming, and to always follow the advice of the HSE and Department of Health in relation to social distancing protocols when at the beach.</p>  <p>  The Bathing Water Regulations 2008 (as amended), transpose the requirements of the 2006 Bathing Water Directive (BWD) into national legislation. These regulations set the framework for the effective management of bathing waters around the country. The regulations also aim to improve health protection for bathers and ensure adequate information is disseminated in a timely manner during the bathing season.</p>  <p>  Currently in Ireland there are almost 150 designated bathing waters identified by local authorities with the help of public consultation.  The water quality in these areas is monitored during the bathing season. The regulations define the bathing season to mean the period from 1st June to 15th September in any calendar year and also set out the sampling and monitoring requirements for all designated bathing waters.</p>  <p>  The bathing water report for 2020, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states that 96% of bathing waters met or exceeded the minimum required standard. This is up from 95% in 2019 and improvements in bathing water quality are welcome and necessary.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases. </p>  <p>  Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p>  <p>www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print?q=housing&amp;years=2017  . </p>  <p>  Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p>  <p>  In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for HAP, a household must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support. Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. </p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, including Working Family Payment is assessable.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p>  <p>  Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for Living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January and May 2021) do not currently permit rental inspections. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors. The City and County Management Association is currently reviewing the situation.</p>  <p>  In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to so. </p>  <p>  While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do. Clare County Council have expressed an interest in piloting virtual inspections. </p>  <p>  Being a social housing leasing tenant offers security as the scheme's operation ensures that in the event that a tenant's current leased accommodation becomes unavailable (through no fault of the tenant); it remains the responsibility of the local authority to find alternative accommodation for the tenant's household either in another property leased by the local authority or a local authority property.</p>  <p>  Where a lease is due to expire, the local authority can avail of the option to renew a lease but it remains the owner's decision whether to renew the lease or to sell the property. </p></reply>

Under this protocol, a victim of domestic violence can apply for Rent Supplement on referral by Tusla or by Tusla-funded service providers. The pilot scheme has been extended until the end of this year and more information is available at www.gov.ie/en/publication/5704d-access-to-rent-supplement-for-victims-of-domestic-violence/  . </p>  <p>  In terms of social housing, in 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to local authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions whereby a household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.</p>  <p>  To qualify for social housing support a household must meet all of the eligibility criteria, which primarily relate to income, availability of alternative accommodation and previous rent arrears. </p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.  The Policy sets out what income should be assessed as part of net income, what deductions can be made and what income is not assessable for the purpose of a social housing assessment. The Policy also provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  Where a household is deemed to meet the eligibility criteria, only then is its housing need assessed under the criteria in Regulation 23 of the 2011 Regulations, having regard to its current accommodation.</p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.</p>  <p>  Under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household is ineligible for social housing support if a member owns alternative accommodation, to the household&rsquo;s current accommodation, that is suitable for the household to live in.  Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. </p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act. Housing authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the housing authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer to local authority social housing. </p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned. Each application must be considered on its own merits and the individual circumstances taken into account.</p></reply>

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p>  <p>In relation to the concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standard facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  &lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo; deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. In this regard, National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which sets out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of, inter alia  , EN 771(series) in Ireland.</p>  <p>In respect of aggregates for concrete, NSAI has published &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; which   outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks). </p>  <p>  The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.</p>  <p>  Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:</p>  <p>  when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,</p>  <p>  when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,</p>  <p>  check National Annexes or Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and</p>  <p>  ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2019, in this regard all works should be carried out using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p>  <p>  The NSAI is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI is not an enforcement body for the purposes of the marketing rules applicable for construction products.</p>  <p>While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No. 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/9.  </p>  <p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013)  , each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. </p>  <p>In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has recently been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.    Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p>  <p>  Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time. </p>  <p>  Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted.     </p>  <p>Pursuant to Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) 765/2008, Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021   is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p>  <p>  Separately, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 which establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, will come into force in 2021.This strengthens the existing provisions in the Construction Products Regulation (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.</p></reply>

The Government is clear in its policy position that the public water system run by Irish Water should remain in public ownership. The Programme for Government specifically provides that the Government will retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national, stand-alone, regulated utility.</p>  <p>  The realisation of this commitment will complete the broad policy and legislative reforms which have seen the public water system embark on a journey of transformation, from a structure based on locally-organised water services authorities, towards a single, national, water utility.  This has been a complex and challenging process for key stakeholders, notably the workers, who include approximately 3,200 local authority water services staff who are subject to service level agreement arrangements with Irish Water as well as a smaller number of staff employed directly by Irish Water and Ervia, together with their trade union representatives, the local government sector, and Ervia/Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In setting out its views and expectations in relation to the next phase of the Water Sector Transformation Programme in this way, the Government is enabling stakeholders to engage meaningfully in the change process which will give them the strongest possible say in determining their own future working arrangements.  On this basis the Workplace Relations Commission is currently re-commencing engagement between the stakeholders on a Framework for the future delivery of water services.   The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 (the Act) imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.</p>  <p>  Should a local authority decide to acquire a site on the register by compulsory purchase, an objection can be made by the person served by the order, and the matter will be ultimately decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  There is no minimum prescribed timeline under the Act that a site must be on the derelict sites register before a local authority can initiate the compulsory purchase procedures in respect of any site.

For example, my Department provides full funding to local authorities for sites that are used for social housing developments, while other Departments will support sites used for programmes that they support in line with the functions of the local authority. Accordingly, the proportion of the overall annual budget provided by my Department to each local authority which is spent on compulsory acquisition is not available from my Department but may be available from individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are empowered under a number of statutes to acquire land, by agreement or compulsorily, for the purposes of performing any of its functions, including the acquisition of derelict sites situated within their functional area under the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act 1990. In this connection, the exercise of compulsory purchase powers to acquire land is a matter for local authorities and is subject to confirmation by An Bord Plean&aacute;la through the appropriate statutory procedure.</p>  <p>  My Department encourages local authorities to be proactive in utilising their legislative powers for compulsory purchase, where necessary, with the aim of bringing the greatest number of recoverable long term vacant dwellings and sites back into use.

My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing.  One such programme that AHBs progress projects through is the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF).</p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years).  At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from my Department. </p><p>Regarding the location and AHB mentioned by the Deputy, there is a housing project comprising 13 high-quality homes for social housing use, that are being progressed by Cl&uacute;id Housing, working in partnership with Limerick City and County Council, who have confirmed a social housing need for 3 and 4 bedroom homes in this area.  </p><p>My Department issued a CALF approval for this Turnkey Project in January 2021.  This project will deliver in two tranches, over Q4 2021 and Q1 2022.  As with all projects in the current COVID-19 climate, delivery programmes and timelines are under constant review.</p><p>Turnkeys are, in the main, homes built by developers under contract for local authorities or AHBs. Turnkeys commonly provide a faster delivery of units (in the majority of cases, planning permission is already secured). In many instances, turnkey delivery has provided a means of delivery in locations where there is a social housing need but where a local authority has no suitable sites. Turnkeys purchased by local authorities or AHBs frequently have arisen where the developer has difficulty in financing the development and without the local authority or AHBs purchase, the scheme would not otherwise have been delivered. These homes are directly expanding overall housing supply because they are new homes built for the local authority or AHBs.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits/   </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  To the end of March 2021, 1179 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 1179 households in the scheme represent 1970 adults and 1699 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1079 active cases being progressed under the scheme.   </p>  <p>At present there are 12 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), 1 private company and 23 lenders participating in the MTR scheme.  The Housing Agency publishes a full range of statistics on the MTR scheme including a status report by lender and by purchaser and is available at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics   </p>  <p>  The scheme relies on the lender making the scheme available to the borrower where the lender has deemed their mortgage to be unsustainable under the MARP process and has assessed the borrower as being eligible for the MTR scheme.  Under the MTR scheme, a household with mortgage arrears goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an AHB or where Home for Life buys the property a social housing tenant of a local authority.  The tenants pay a differential rent based on their income that is designed to be affordable and which is subject to periodic review.  Where a change of circumstances in an individual household occurs, the rent level will be reviewed.  </p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme in 2017 taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.</p>  <p>  Under this alternatively funded model, Home for Life purchases properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority.  Home for Life is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements.</p>  <p>  The provision to allow the borrower to buyback the property has been a feature of the MTR scheme since its inception.  A borrower has the option of buying back the property after 5 years or at the discretion of the property owner before the 5 years has expired.  Where an AHB or Home for Life buys the property from the lender at a non-discounted price, the borrower has the option of buying back the property at the open market value on the date of the buyback but the property cannot cost less than what the property owner paid for it.  Alternatively, where the property was purchased from the lender at a discounted price, the borrower may opt to buy back the property at the price the property owner paid for it plus all costs incurred by the property owner on the property including repairs, cost of finance and legal costs.  A clawback will also apply to this option where the borrower sells the property within 20 years of buying back the property.  To date, there had been only 1 case where a borrower has bought back their home.</p>  <p>  Regardless of who the property owner is under the MTR scheme, AHB or Home for Life, the local authority is obliged to meet the housing needs of social housing tenants indefinitely and beyond the term of the applicable lease arrangement. </p>  <p>  AHBs are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.   AHBs, as landlords, are responsible for managing and maintaining the properties they acquire under the MTR scheme.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has facilitated more individuals and families staying in their homes.  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it.   Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme. </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, including Working Family Payment, is assessable.</p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Following the construction of the Military Road cutting by locals  increased.  The most significant and impactful draining and cutting of the blanket bog  took place during times of crisis namely during &ldquo;The Emergency&rdquo;  of the 1940&rsquo;s and the oil crisis of the 1980&rsquo;s and finally in 1986 an area of intact blanket bog was dug with drains in preparation to cut turf. This raised increased concerns for the future of the bogland habitat and the impact the degraded blanket bog could have on the water quality supplying Dublin. The area came into State ownership in 1989.</p><p>Drain blocking works to stop the degradation of the bog was started by National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1993 and continued until 1997.</p><p>From 1993 to 1995, drains at Liffey Head to the east of the Military Road were blocked by machine. In the more sensitive areas, close to bog pools, these were blocked by hand. Damming methodology, machines and tools used were all trial and error as there had been little or no similar projects carried out in Ireland at this time.</p><p>In 1995 and 1996 the drain-blocking extended across the road from Liffey Head bridge to the lower slopes of Kippure.</p><p>In 1997 handmade dams were constructed on smaller drains to the Kippure site and repairs made to the original, poorly constructed dams to the east of the road.</p><p>Rehabilition work affected approximately 100 hectares and cost circa &pound;45,000.</p><p>The Wicklow Mountains National Park Management plan 2005-2009 listed the following as actions:</p><p>Installation of silt traps, management plans for Shranamuck to the west and for Liffey Head to the east, continuation of conservation works, the monitoring and repair of dams and liaison with remaining turf cutters.</p><p>In 2016 the last turf cutter was moved away from the area to cut turf in a less sensitive area and monitoring of the site is ongoing.</p><p>To date management plans for Shranamuck and The Liffey Head bog have not been drawn up.  </p></reply>

Information on the schemes, including those that have been approved in Cork City and County, that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at:</p><p><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund/</i>, and </p><p><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf/</i>. </p><p>My Department continues to engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects, with the first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase later this year being the Boherboy project in Cork City. </p><p>These homes will come with an initial price of between 10% and 40% below market price, with the discount provided remaining as a fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021. Applications for affordable housing on local authority lands, supported by the Serviced Sites Fund, will be made through the local authorities.</p><p>In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered by local authorities, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help first-time buyers secure their own home by providing up to 20% equity support to bridge the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. This would seem to be the specific scheme referred to in the question.  </p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill will provide a basis for the establishment of the scheme which it is anticipated will be operated and administered by a newly established a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The Bill also provides that the Minister may agree the terms by which the equity support may be provided in a memorandum of agreement with the SPV covering, inter alia, areas such as purchaser eligibility and financial means, the homes that may be considered eligible under the scheme, and the amount of funding that can be provided.</p><p>Determining the price caps for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme requires balancing the accessibility of the scheme for eligible purchasers, mitigating against potential inflationary pressure and ensuring that a range of homes can be supplied across key locations. Working price caps envisaged for the equity scheme are detailed below, and are informed by the CSO recorded median prices of new First Time Buyer homes sold by area. The equity scheme, therefore, targets homes in the lower half of recorded sales prices over the previous year. The proposed caps will be reviewed and finalised in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s deployment, and will be kept under review thereafter. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Price   Cap (&euro;)</th>       <th>Location/Local   Authority Area</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>    Price   Cap (&euro;)   </b></td>       <td><b>    Location/Local   Authority Area   </b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>450,000</td>       <td>Dublin City, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>400,000</td>       <td>Fingal, Cork City, Galway City, South   Dublin, Wicklow</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>350,000</td>       <td>Cork County, Galway County, Kildare, <br /><br />  Limerick City and County, Meath</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>300,000</td>       <td>Clare, Westmeath, Wexford</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>275,000</td>       <td>Carlow, Louth, Offaly</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>250,000</td>       <td>Kerry, Kilkenny, Laois,   Roscommon, Waterford</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>225,000</td>       <td>Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford,   Mayo,<br /><br />  Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Additional price caps for apartments</b></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>500,000</td>       <td>Dublin City, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>450,000</td>       <td>Fingal, Cork City, South Dublin<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Required regulations for the shared equity scheme will be made following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, and it is anticipated that the earliest deployment of this scheme will be later in 2021.

Information is available at: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx</i>.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected on prescribed development - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate the generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.</p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for "glint and glare" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department has consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and has developed draft interim regulations in this regard. </p>  <p>  These draft regulations have now been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC, and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals, which will include public consultation as part of the process. This process is expected to take between four and five months to complete. </p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q4 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed by Q4 2021. The final supplementary set of regulations will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

The scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  The household must be eligible for social housing and the property must meet the appropriate standards for social housing.</p><p>To the end of March 2021, 1179 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 1179 households in the scheme represent 1970 adults and 1699 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1079 active cases being progressed under the scheme.  </p><p>Given the nature of the individual property transaction underpinning MTR, the decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme is a matter for the MTR provider concerned which can be either an AHB or Home for Life.  I can neither compel a lender to sell a property at a particular price nor compel an AHB or Home for Life to purchase a property at a particular price.  In relation to the specific case raised, I understand that a sale price has yet to be agreed between the lender and Home for Life.</p><p>While the Housing Agency as administrators of the scheme on my Department's behalf make every effort to encourage stakeholders to meet their individual timelines set out within the MTR process, cases will arise where agreeing a sale price between a lender and a MTR provider may become protracted.  Where a sale price cannot be agreed, the case will be terminated.</p><p>Where a MTR application is active, it is important that the borrower continues to engage with their lender on their application and it is the lender who is the point of contact for the borrower throughout the MTR process.</p><p>A review of the MTR scheme undertaken in 2017 introduced a range of improvements to the eligibility criteria and its administration. In order to increase awareness and understanding of the scheme a new website, <i>www.mortgagetorent.ie</i>, was developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements were put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.  As a result of the improvements implemented, an upward trend in case completions has been evident since 2018.</p><p>Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017 and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to strengthen the scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency to identify any further improvements required to the scheme.</p></reply>

The Government remains committed to ensuring that the local government sector retains a sustainable and stable source of funding from Local Property Tax (LPT), distributed to local authorities via the Local Government Fund, to support the delivery of local authority services.</p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and since then the overall principles and allocation methodology have broadly remained the same. 80% of LPT is retained in the area it is collected, with the other 20% supporting equalisation for local authorities with LPT bases lower than their funding baseline.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  The funding for all local authorities will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process and in the context of the aforementioned LPT revaluation process. </p></reply>

This allows the impacts of awnings including their scale, the need to observe relevant apparatus standards, impacts on pedestrians, residential amenity, traffic management, protected structures, the location of the premises etc to be taken into account in the consideration of any such planning application.</p><p>Where a question arises on whether development is or is not development, or is or is not exempted development, any person may seek a declaration from the planning authority under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended. </p><p>Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

This is added to the overall cost of the loan.</p><p>It is important to note that the local authority MPI scheme covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available. </p><p>Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors have the main influence on determining the price of the local authority MPI scheme:</p><p>standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;</p><p>the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p><p>the terms and conditions of  the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; </p><p>the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.</p><p>In determining the rate for the local authority MPI scheme, consideration was given to all of the above factors, and the procurement process that was undertaken reflected those requirements. It is important to also point out that there are a number of additional features of the local authority MPI scheme as follows:</p><p>in the event of a claim, the insurance covers the amount of the mortgage repayable on death which is similar to standard MPI;</p><p>the member&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are covered if there is a claim as a result of disability andnot death; this additional feature is not included in standard MPI products;</p><p>an extra cover of &euro;3,000 is also provided in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, which is not included in standard MPI products; </p><p>the local authority MPI scheme covers members to age 75 for death, while ordinary MPI is usually based on a ceasing age of 65 unless an older age is agreed and priced.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The Department is currently liasing with Kildare County Council to progress these affordable homes.  </p>  <p>  Information on the schemes that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at:</p>  <p>www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund/  , and </p>  <p>www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf/  .</p>  <p>  These homes will come with an initial price of between 10% and 40% below market price, with the discount provided remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as detailed in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill.</p>  <p>  In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the forthcoming Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build private home. It will help first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want.  Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  The provision of new-build affordable homes through the measures mentioned above are designed to increase housing supply in general, thereby helping to address the under-supply that currently exists.</p>  <p>  Some people, however, may prefer to rent than to buy, making Cost Rental a more appropriate and viable option. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway. The first Cost Rental homes in Ireland, 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, will be delivered by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies in Quarter 3 2021. Dublin City Council is also progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill.</p>  <p>  The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I have approved in principle the financing, this year, of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.</p>  <p>In addition to the measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: www.lda.ie/  .  </p>  <p>  Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p>  <p>The Help to Buy Scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available online at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx  .</p>  <p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage. Further information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available at www.rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie/  .</p></reply>

The report&rsquo;s recommendations were not unanimously endorsed by the group&rsquo;s members. </p><p>An Taoiseach has confirmed previously that while there was some brief consideration of that report by the Houses in late 2019, if further examination of its proposals by the current members of the Houses were to lead to a consensus around some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, such a consensus would provide a basis for their implementation.</p></reply>

Ireland has engaged closely with the Generation Equality process, including through my participation at the virtual high-level event hosted by the Government of Mexico in March. </p>  <p>  The Paris Forum will see the launch of a series of actions to be taken over the coming years to further progress on gender equality.  My focus has been on education, building on our Drive for Five initiative, which Ireland, with UN Women, the Global Partnership for Education, ONE and the Malala Fund, launched in February 2020 and which asked all Governments to commit to five actions to improve girls access to education.  With this focus, Ireland has played an active role in the preparations for Paris, including advocating for a strong focus on gender transformative education and girls&rsquo; education across all strands of the Forum&rsquo;s work, reflecting the importance of girls' education to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This is why I have pledged &euro;60 million to the Global Partnership for Education over the next five years, with &euro;10 million earmarked to the Girls&rsquo; Accelerator Mechanism.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive sexuality education plays an important role in strengthening girls&rsquo; abilities to make autonomous decisions about their bodies, sexuality and reproduction. It can also help to gradually change societal norms and attitudes, and remove policy and legal barriers to sexual and reproductive health services. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing within my Department in coordination with other Government Departments to finalise the Government&rsquo;s commitments ahead of the Summit. These will reflect our strong domestic and international commitment to advance gender equality. All Member States have been asked to identify commitments, across six thematic areas. These commitments will be collectively monitored to 2026, and will form the basis for global momentum on gender equality. </p></reply>

For those who must travel the restrictions and guidance that apply are outlined on the COVID-19 Travel Advice pages on Gov.ie. These are subject to ongoing amendment subject to public health advice.</p><p>Currently, those arriving into Ireland from abroad, including those travelling from Great Britain, must complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form, obtain a pre-travel negative RT-PCR test and quarantine on arrival in Ireland in line with the terms listed on Gov.ie. In general, these requirements do not apply to persons who travel from Northern Ireland. However, they do apply to persons who arrive here via Northern Ireland and have been overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival. Those travelling to Ireland who have been in one of the listed high-risk Designated States in the 14 days before they arrive, must complete mandatory hotel quarantine. Great Britain is not at present on this list.  Those travelling from Great Britain should however arrange a COVID-19 (RT-PCR) test at least 5 days after arrival.</p><p>The UK Government and the UK's devolved administrations have established regulations for international travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, individuals whose journey begins in Ireland and who have remained in Ireland, or elsewhere in the Common Travel Area, for 10 days prior to travel, do not require a pre-travel PCR test or evidence of having been vaccinated to travel to any part of the UK. They are also not subject to mandatory quarantine rules once they have entered the UK, but they do remain subject to the local restrictions and guidance in place. While this is current advice, I cannot of course anticipate what rules the UK Government and the UK&rsquo;s devolved administrations will apply at a future date. </p><p>Under current Scottish Government regulations, travel between Ireland and Scotland should only take place for listed permitted reasons, for example for work or education. At this time, the Scottish authorities do not require Irish citizens to complete a passenger locator form. For a more detailed understanding of Scottish regulations and to check for changes, those who need to travel should monitor the Scottish Government web pages on &ldquo;Coronavirus (COVID-19): travel and transport&rdquo; or consult with the UK or Scottish authorities directly.</p><p>From 19 July, subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from outside the EU/EEA, including with regard to our policy on travel from Britain to Ireland.  It is expected that the general travel advisory against all non-essential international travel will end and that we will instead advise citizens to travel safely and in accordance with public health guidance and restrictions.  An &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be coordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of variants of concern or variants of interest.  I wish to see travel between Ireland and Britain taking place in a seamless manner as soon as this is feasible and safe. </p></reply>

During that meeting, we had a frank and useful exchange on a range of political, trade and economic issues, including human rights and the opening of our new Embassy in Rabat. </p><p>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to discuss human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels, including at a bilateral and EU level, and through the United Nations Universal Periodic Review mechanism. </p><p>The rights of LGBTI+ persons are a human rights priority for Ireland and we continue to support initiatives condemning violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity and promoting the rights of LGBTI+ individuals in international fora. At Morocco&rsquo;s most recent Universal Periodic Review in 2017, Ireland made a recommendation on addressing the stigmatisation lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.</p><p>On Western Sahara, Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding position is one of full support for MINURSO, the UN-led process and the Secretary General&rsquo;s efforts to bring about a definitive and mutually acceptable political settlement on this issue. We support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, but we do not have a view on the outcome of that decision &ndash; be it independence, integration, autonomy, or some other solution &ndash; so long as it is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination. Ireland's position in this respect has been clearly set out at the UN Security Council at its consultations on 21 April 2021.</p></reply>

As such, the various testing and quarantine exemptions available to arrivals holding Digital Covid Certificates, depends on the measures and entry rules in place at the country of destination. Council Recommendation 2020/1475 which has recently been revised, sets out standard validity periods for Covid-19 tests in order to simplify travel within the Union. Most Member States already provide that a PCR test be carried out not more than 72 hours prior to arrival. However, as with all Recommendations, it is not legally binding on all Member States. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, policy and operational matters relating to the recognition of Covid-19 tests are primarily a matter for the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

However, ease of travel is vital to our economic relationships and for building connections across the Atlantic. We continue to engage with the US State Department, primarily via our Embassy in Washington D.C., on travel, and the associated restrictions, between our two countries. My Department also continues to engage closely with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin. </p>  <p>  I raised the issue of resumption of travel between our two countries in my contacts with the US Administration, including during my meeting with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan in May. We agreed that it is important that we restore connectivity with the US as soon as it is feasible, and safe, to do so. Together with other EU countries, we have also written to US Secretary of State Blinken requesting reconsideration of the US travel restrictions currently in place.</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply committed to people-to-people links with the US. We will work to ensure that the restrictions will not have any long-term impact on existing channels of migration, exchange and tourism which benefit our countries significantly. We are particularly keen that the current travel restrictions will not negatively impact the future of the J1 and Working Holiday Agreement programmes. I look forward to working with the US again to promote travel between our countries, once the Covid-19 crisis has abated, and in accordance with public health advice.</p></reply>

EU leaders agreed to a set of concrete measures in reaction to the flagrant disregard for international law shown by the Lukashenko regime and the work of operationalising those measures has begun. </p>  <p>  Belarusian aircraft have been banned from EU airspace and EU aircraft are now forbidden from overflying Belarusian airspace. The EU has also announced a &euro;3 billion comprehensive plan of economic support for a future democratic Belarus. This plan reflects the EU's commitment to the Belarusian people who have been protesting since the fraudulent August 2020 Presidential election, which was neither free nor fair.</p>  <p>  The EU has already imposed targeted sanctions against 88 individuals responsible for the fraudulent election and the systematic repression of the Belarusian people and civil society. Those sanctioned include Alexander Lukashenko and his son Viktor. Sanctions have also been imposed on 7 business entities supporting the regime. </p>  <p>  EU leaders have agreed to impose further targeted sanctions to make those responsible for the ongoing repression of the Belarusian people, and the incident involving a Ryanair aircraft, accountable for their unacceptable actions. A further package of sanctions, including ones specifically linked to those responsible for the Ryanair incident, is expected in the coming weeks. Consideration is being given to the adoption of broader economic sanctions and Ireland is actively engaged with our EU partners in that regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to a peaceful and democratic resolution of the crisis in Belarus. Our focus remains on ensuring that the human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic will of the Belarusian people are fully respected. We maintain our call on the Belarusian authorities to end the repression and engage in a meaningful and inclusive national dialogue that leads to elections that are free and fair.     </p></reply>

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process.</p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms, including the replacement and refurbishment of Naval Service vessels. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result of the White Paper commitment to Naval Service vessel replacement, the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the immediate White Paper project in this context. The MRV project is an important developmental project and indicative of the commitment to on-going investment and development of defence capabilities. It is a major project and work remains on-going in progressing it. This project is at currently underway and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV, subject to availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall EDP process.</p></reply>

The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</p>  <p>  On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The Government has acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues that are currently impacting on Naval Service operations.

The report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) on retention and recruitment in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) contained a wide range of recommendations to address retention and recruitment difficulties and these have been progressed through the High Level Implementation Plan &quot;Strengthening Our Defence Forces&quot;. </p><p>Immediate benefits included a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance; the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain allowances and the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties. The Defence Forces have also received the benefits of Public Service Pay Agreements with further increases available under the new Pay Agreement, should it be accepted by the Defence Forces Representative Associations.  </p><p>Work has also progressed on a broad range of non-pay measures in line with the PSPC recommendations, including in workforce planning; enhanced professional military education; bespoke leadership training; development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy; a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF (including the possibility of extending retirement ages) and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas.  </p><p>A Service Commitment Scheme, introduced in 2019,  for pilots, has had a stabilising effect on Air Corp pilot numbers, with a further iteration of the Scheme scheduled in 2021. A Naval Service Sea-going Service Commitment Scheme was also introduced this year and a sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270, which was applied in the 2020 tax year, has been extended for the 2021 tax year, and has been  increased to &euro;1,500. </p><p>The introduction of schemes to allow for the re-commissioning of former Officers and the re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel of the PDF have also assisted in addressing particular skills gaps. </p><p>In addition, a range of direct entry specialist competitions have been initiated as a further means to fill critical positions. Furthermore, the upper age limit for both direct entry Naval Service and Air Corps technical appointments has recently been increased to 29 years. </p><p>The Programme for Government additionally contains a commitment to &ldquo;<i>ensure that all enlisted members of the Defence Forces have the same access to health care as officers currently do</i>&rdquo;, which is in addition to  comprehensive range of primary and secondary medical care currently provided by the Defence Organisation, at no charge, to all members of the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF). A joint military-civilian working group has been established to progress this commitment. </p><p>There is no quick fix to the challenges facing the Defence Forces today. However, I remain fully committed to restoring the capacity of the Defence Forces. Whilst there has been significant work undertaken to date, it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced. </p></reply>

I understand all remaining Government Departments will have moved to gov.ie by the end of August. </p>  <p>  Gov.ie is the main Government website and recorded over 122 million page views in 2020.  Gov.ie partially complies with the double-A Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards, and the four principles of accessibility in that it is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. This is similar to most other government sites across the European Union. Accessibility to gov.ie is being enhanced by improving the level of plain English used for services on the site. This allows users of all levels to be able to find and understand information as quickly as possible. In addition, the gov.ie team have continuously performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website went live. The gov.ie team has engaged with and continues to engage with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were identified and action taken to rectify and resolve these issues. In addition, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) have since released updates to the core code of the gov.ie website to improve accessibility. </p>  <p>  All other sites managed by OGCIO are currently being moved to a new Content Management System (CMS) which has been built with WCAG compatibility in mind. This project is ongoing with satisfactory progress being made this year.  </p>  <p>  The position in relation to the branches under my Department is set out as follows.</p>  <p>  The website of the Office of Emergency Planning falls under the remit of OGCIO, hosted on gov.ie and includes the sites formally designated as emergencyplanning.ie; winterready.ie; and summerready.ie. </p>  <p>  The website of Civil Defence is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Ireland. When the Civil Defence website was developed it met the Accessibility Guidelines of 1.0, which were the guidelines at the time of development. Following the introduction of updated guidelines 2.1, the Department of Defence has engaged with the developers of the Civil Defence website in order to review and report on what action is needed in order to comply with the updated Accessibility Guidelines 2.10.</p></reply>

This has been particularly the case in the buoyant economy that the country experienced, which resulted in strong demand for the skills that Defence Forces personnel acquire during their careers. A number of &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; exist in particular areas and civil and military management are actively engaged in considering measures to address these. </p>  <p>  As many such specialties are developed in-house, in some cases this can result in a long lead in time to qualification. To fill vacancies in a speedier fashion, a range of alternative recruitment approaches have been developed further such as campaigns to recruit specialists by direct entry and  the recommissioning and re-enlistment schemes. </p>  <p>  The military authorities advise that the 2021 competition for Air Corps aircraft maintenance technicians, which closed on 31st March 2021, has resulted in 663 applications that are currently being processed.

This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closures.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the huge effort and collaboration by teachers, school leaders and of course students, in relation to the examinations and Accredited Grades process over the last number of months, the timeframes for finalisation of results are particularly challenging this year. This is in part due to the fact that the SEC has to manage both the examinations and Accredited Grades processes in parallel.  </p>  <p>  The results issue date this year, 3 September, must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates. To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two. </p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information. </p>  <p>  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.  The CAO have announced that Round 1 offers will be made on 7 September. </p>  <p>  For those Leaving Certificate candidates who have applied to pursue their higher education in UK Universities, the UCAS deadline for acceptance of conditional offers is 8 September 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2020, along with the UK, countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Hungary showed flexibility in working with the Department to accommodate Irish students, when results issued on 7 September 2020. </p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has already been engaged with these countries, as has my own Department and both Departments will continue their work to ensure that the same flexibility will be extended to the 2021 Leaving Certificate candidates. </p>  <p>  It is important that candidates who have applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland should engage with the institutions to which they have applied as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position.</p></reply>

In subjects or modules where it is not specifically mentioned the topic of breastfeeding may occur during class conversation and through interactions with students.</p>  <p>  For example, from a nutritional aspect the subject of breastfeeding may come up in Post Primary Home Economics when discussing healthy lifestyles and nutritional requirements across all ages. In the Leaving Certificate Applied Childcare/Community care module on the care of babies and young children, Unit 1 addresses breast and bottle feeding. </p>  <p>  From a social aspect, Junior Cycle Home Economics includes Strand Two on exploring the roles and responsibilities of the family while Leaving Certificate Home Economics includes Topic 3.1.6: Family As A Caring Unit. In Leaving Certificate Applied Social Education, the module on Social and Health Education, Unit 2: Relationships &ndash;  the topic may be covered while discussing parenting and the needs that children have at various stages of their development.</p>  <p>  Further relevant subjects would be within the SPHE curriculum. Junior Cycle SPHE Strand Two: Minding Myself and Others contains learning outcomes 2.3: describe what promotes a sense of belonging in school, at home and in the wider community and their own role in creating an inclusive environment and 2.4: distinguish between appropriate care giving and receiving. At Leaving Certificate level, SPHE aims to develop health literacy, both for the individual student and for groups. Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Health has produced a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.</p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.</p>  <p>  In general, my Department does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any educational textbook. The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. </p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.</p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms</p></reply>

The interim review in 2017 highlighted the considerable progress which had been made since the launch of the Strategy in 2011 notably in promoting a high level of literacy for all.  The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2016 results showed that the reading skills of our primary school children, both in the paper based and online assessment, are amongst the best in all European and OECD countries.</p>  <p>  The commitments carried out over the lifetime of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011-2020) has prioritised the enhancement of learners&rsquo; literacy and numeracy skills. Commitments under the Strategy include reforms in initial teacher education, dedicated support for school leaders&rsquo;, teachers&rsquo; professional learning and curriculum reform. Priorities are linked to actions for related policy developments in my Department including the DEIS Plan 2017. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government my Department is tasked with the development of a successor Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy for all learners in early years, primary and post-primary schools. Development of the strategy will be done in consultation with all education stakeholders and other Government departments and bodies. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Education I am very conscious of the importance of library services and the value of these in the context of the supports available to schools. Responsibility for the support and provision of library services rests with my colleague, Heather Humphreys, TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development</p>  <p>  Local libraries currently provide a wide range of resources and activities which support Primary and Post-primary schools in developing children&rsquo;s literacy, numeracy, creativity and communication skills. By building on existing partnerships between schools and libraries, all schools can benefit directly from this ongoing cooperation.</p>  <p>  Each library service operates a network of central libraries, branch libraries and smaller part-time branches. Some library services also provide support for schools through mobile libraries or a school library van. Schools can access all of the services for primary schools through the larger branches or a central library. Schools can also access some services through smaller part-time branches.</p>  <p>  In addition to book borrowing, class visits and provision of access to reading and curriculum support, libraries provide learners at primary and post-primary with a reading space in the library branch as well as access to electronic and online resources.  Reference resources and research assistance are also available to students and teachers. In addition, libraries also provide students with access to study spaces where practicable.</p>  <p>  Libraries also provide ongoing library programmes and initiatives throughout the year and during school holiday periods, including an annual summer activities&rsquo; programme, to support the continuing development of children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy skills.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 continues the programme of major reinvestment in our primary and post-primary education system.  Building on the initiatives set out in the Programme for Government the budget for the Department of Education is &euro;8.9 billion in 2021, an increase of &euro;410 million or some 5% on 2020.</p>  <p>  The Budget includes an additional allocation of &euro;226 million which is being provided to schools to meet costs relating to Covid-19. This allocation represents the balance of the &euro;437 million package approved by Government last July as part of the Roadmap for the Reopening Schools. </p>  <p>  Currently, my Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for the purchase of books.  Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.1 million in 2020 to schools.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1 million provided under Budget 2020 was allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.</p>  <p>  I am committed to investing in education but I have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances. Regretfully therefore I am not in a position to reinstate the library grant.</p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074/2020, &lsquo;Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.</p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education</i><i>and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers</i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning. A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.</p><p>It is hoped that current fifth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition when they return to school at the start of the 2021/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19.  I am conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in planning for the 2022 Leaving Certificate.</p></reply>

Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.</p><p>The frontloading of SNAs for mainstream classes is a key part of the School Inclusion Model.  The Department and NCSE are committed to its introduction as part of the development of that Model.</p><p>The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents. These sessions will now be rescheduled to take place during the 2021/22 school year. Further information will be issued by the NCSE in due course.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year:</p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will  automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is publishedon the NCSE website www.ncse.ie/for-schools </p><p>The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2021/22 school year on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Departments website.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. </p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>Detailed information on how a school can make an exceptional needs review appeal is available on the NCSE website at, www.ncse.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702 and as a result of the programme of pay restoration the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692. This will increase to &euro;38,692 by October 2022 under the current pay agreement, Building Momentum. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall within three months of the passing of this Act prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo; The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assessed the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledged that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government has supported the gradual negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance). The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provided for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants. I am fully aware that the teacher unions had outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters were given full consideration and under the new pay agreement. </p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, a new public service pay agreement Building Momentum was agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors, including my Department. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale, which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. My Department is currently working on the implementation of this and it is anticipated that this will come into effect shortly.</p>  <p>  These measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis.</p><p>Planning for future needs takes into consideration the current availability of such places and focuses on those locations where additional provision is required. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school.</p><p>The Department currently does not have a policy supporting the establishment of special classes in fee-charging schools. To date the experience has been that schools in the free education scheme have sufficient capacity to meet the need for additional special classes.</p><p>In establishing new special classes, the NCSE is required to satisfy itself that the class is both sustainable and available to all of the students who may need special class placements in a particular area.</p><p>Finally, I can reassure the Deputy that the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.

At present it is a requirement for face coverings to be worn by teachers and staff in primary schools when a physical distance of two meters from other staff or children cannot be maintained.  </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has published advice on the use of face coverings in educational settings and is available here. Revised HPSC guidelines for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) published on 7 January 2021 recommended surgical grade masks for all SNAs. </p><p>Public health advice also provides that cloth face coverings should not be worn by any of the following groups:</p><p>- any person with difficulty breathing</p><p>- any person who is unable to remove the face-covering without assistance</p><p>- any person who has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the face covering, for example persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.</p><p>As part of the risk mitigation measures in schools outlined in the &lsquo;<i>Framework Plan for phased return of primary school education&rsquo;</i>, my Department has also confirmed that medical grade masks should also be provided for all teachers and SNAs in special schools and special classes and those staff by necessity that need to be in close and continued proximity with pupils with intimate care needs including School Bus Escorts. Schools may access the current PPE framework to procure supplies of medical grade masks.</p><p>Under the terms of the Sick Leave Scheme for teachers, an employer must refer a teacher to the Occupational Health Service (Medmark) where reasonable concerns exist as to the capacity of the teacher to undertake his/her duties in a manner that is safe. </p><p>Where a teacher is referred to Medmark by the employer for an independent medical assessment and where there is a difference of medical opinion between Medmark and the treating Doctor/Consultant on a teacher&rsquo;s medical fitness for work, Medmark will consult with the treating Doctor/Consultant before providing final advice to the employer. If there is a specific need for an independent medical assessment, this can be facilitated through Medmark.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) keeps infection prevention and control measures, which include the wearing of masks under review on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

Section 7 of the Teaching Council Act provides for the Council to establish procedures in relation to the induction of teachers into the teaching profession.</p><p>The Council defines a &ldquo;newly qualified teacher&rdquo; or &ldquo;NQT&rdquo; as a teacher who meets the Council&rsquo;s requirements in terms of qualifications, but who has not completed the required period of professional practice.</p><p>Upon registration with the Teaching Council, post-qualification professional practice is applied as a condition of registration to all primary and post-primary NQTs. Until recent years, the traditional route to fulfil this condition for primary teachers was &lsquo;probation&rsquo; and for post primary teachers was &lsquo;post-qualification employment (PQE)&rsquo;.</p><p>The <i>Droichead</i>process replaces these traditional processes of probation and PQE. The <i>Droichead</i>policy was approved and implemented by Council on a phased based in 2016. It has been in its growth phase since 2016 and has been the sole route to induction for all NQTs since September 2020. <i>Droichead</i>is an induction framework which supports the professional learning of NQTs during the induction phase. The <i>Droichead </i>process consists of school-based induction which is underpinned by reflective practice, mentoring and professional conversations and additional professional learning activities.</p><p>Since 1 June 2020, the condition of <i>Droichead</i>has been applied as a condition of registration to all primary and post-primary NQTs, regardless of the date of qualification. If, however teachers can provide evidence to show they have previously successfully completed the traditional processes of probation or PQE, the <i>Droichead</i>condition can be removed.</p><p>It is important to note that teachers registered with conditions are eligible to receive the fully qualified rate of pay, apply for and be appointed to permanent positions.</p><p>Also, to note that<i>Droichead</i>is not a newer version of the previously accredited programme of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) known as the Higher Diploma in Education. These programmes of ITE have been reconceptualised as the currently accredited two-year Professional Masters of Education programmes since 2012.</p><p>My Department understands that the Teaching Council are engaging directly with the teacher referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.  </p><p>This year, just under 25% of the total Education budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special educational needs.As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case. </p><p>My Department will continue to provide for a continuum of provision, which includes special class and special school places for children who have been assessed as needing such placements.</p><p>The Department's school building programme is focused on providing the additional school places to ensure that every child, including children with special needs, has a school place.

This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closures.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the huge effort and collaboration by teachers, school leaders and of course students, in relation to the examinations and Accredited Grades process over the last number of months, the timeframes for finalisation of results are particularly challenging this year. This is in part due to the fact that the SEC has to manage both the examinations and Accredited Grades processes in parallel.  </p>  <p>  The results issue date this year, 3 September, must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates. To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two. </p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information. </p>  <p>  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.

The EU Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive (2013/55/EC) seeks to facilitate the free movement of professionals within the EU. In accordance with the Directive, people who are deemed fully qualified as teachers in one EU member state are entitled to have their qualifications recognised in all other member states. This recognition may be granted subject to conditions to ensure that the qualifications are of a comparable standard to those achieved by graduates of accredited programmes in Ireland. The Teaching Council apply this to teachers qualified in other jurisdictions also.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the Teaching Council amended its Registration Regulations for a limited timeframe due to the Covid 19 pandemic, to provide for teachers who qualified overseas to complete their post-qualification induction in Ireland, rather than in the country in which their teaching qualification was obtained.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council (Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 were signed in to law on May 30th, providing for the Council to extend the 2020 emergency measures related to the registration of teachers in order to manage the ongoing impact of the pandemic, to October 2021.</p></reply>

Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. </p><p>While this spirit of partnership is in place in schools the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill will provide a mechanism for enhanced consultation on such matters in schools. This legislation provides a clear framework that schools will have to apply in their engagement with students and parents. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The Bill completed all stages of the Seanad in late 2019. The Department of Education is currently awaiting an order for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools, my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to recognised primary, special and post-primary schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. This included &euro;50m in respect of the 2020-2021 school year brought forward and issued in December 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions. The funding is intended to enable schools to implement their Digital Learning Plan through provision of appropriate infrastructure. This includes Desktop PCs, laptops, tablets or hybrid devices, projectors/flat screens, cloud-based tools and software applications, and learning platforms.  </p><p>Digital Strategy ICT annual grant funding </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>&euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016/17</td>       <td>&euro;30million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017/18</td>       <td>&euro;30million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018/19*</td>       <td>&euro;50million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019/2020 &amp;amp; 2020-2021**</td>       <td>&euro;100million</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Includes some &euro;5million application based top up funding to schools</p><p>** Funding for the 2020-2021 school year was brought forward to issue in 2020 to support schools to deal with the impact of the pandemic. </p><p>Further information on criteria and the funding allocation applying can be found in the ICT Grant Circular 0077/2020, available on the Department's website.</p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. </p><p>Primary schools can use the Minor Works Grant for the provision of ICT infrastructure, and general capitation that issues to schools can also be used for that purpose. New schools and school extension projects also receive funding for ICT infrastructure as part of their furniture and equipment funding.</p><p>Development of a new Digital Strategy is underway and an extensive consultation process has commenced with an open call for submissions, and questionnaires for practitioners, parents and learners. Further strands of the consultation will include engagement through focus groups. A Consultative Advisory Group has been established comprising key stakeholders representing parents, teachers, students and industry. Future funding measures to support schools in embedding the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment, including addressing educational disadvantage in the context of access to digital infrastructure, will be considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

Each 1 point adjustment to the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;56.5m per annum. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools.  For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1).  Budget 2021 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2021/22 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools. In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.  Each one point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule would cost approximately &euro;14.5m annually.</p>  <p>  While each one point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule results in an approximate 300 additional teaching posts,  the number of additional classrooms required would be dependent on the existing accommodation arrangements in the schools due to gain a teaching post.</p></reply>

This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. </p></reply>

Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017.

This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closures.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the huge effort and collaboration by teachers, school leaders and of course students, in relation to the examinations and Accredited Grades process over the last number of months, the timeframes for finalisation of results are particularly challenging this year. This is in part due to the fact that the SEC has to manage both the examinations and Accredited Grades processes in parallel. </p>  <p>  The results issue date this year, 3 September, must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates. To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two. </p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information. </p>  <p>  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.  The CAO have announced that Round 1 offers will be made on 7 September. </p>  <p>  For those Leaving Certificate candidates who have applied to pursue their higher education in UK Universities, the UCAS deadline for acceptance of conditional offers is 8 September 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2020, along with the UK, countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Hungary showed flexibility in working with the Department to accommodate Irish students, when results issued on 7 September 2020. </p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has already been engaged with these countries, as has my own Department and both Departments will continue their work to ensure that the same flexibility will be extended to the 2021 Leaving Certificate candidates. </p>  <p>  It is important that candidates who have applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland should engage with the institutions to which they have applied as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position.</p></reply>

Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

Physical Education is allocated a minimum of 135 hours across the three years of Junior Cycle. Schools develop their programme of study based on the physical activity areas of Health Related Activity, Athletics, Adventure Activities, Aquatics, Dance, Gymnastics and Games. A new Junior Cycle Physical Education specification that is designed for a minimum of 135 hours, aligned to the Framework for Junior Cycle, is based on the current NCCA short course and draws from the Junior Cycle Physical Education Syllabus is currently under development by the NCCA. The consultation on the Background Paper and Brief for Junior Cycle Physical Education specification is now open.</p>  <p>  At Senior Cycle, PE is available through both the examinable subject, Leaving Certificate PE (LCPE) and the non-examinable subject, Senior Cycle PE. After a phase 1 introduction, any school that wishes to offer LCPE from September 2020 is able to do so. LCPE is designed to be taught in a minimum of 180 hours across 5th and 6th year. A Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education (SCPE) has been published by the Department and is designed to support teachers in planning quality learning in Physical Education for all students in Senior Cycle. The non-examinable Framework will assist schools in designing a physical education programme for Senior Cycle students, including students who do or do not elect to take Physical Education as a subject for their Leaving Certificate examination. From September 2020, the new Framework replaced the existing guidelines for PE at Senior Cycle. All students in Senior Cycle should be studying SCPE. However, if a student is studying the optional LCPE specification, they are not required to also study the SCPE Framework, although this is not prohibited.</p></reply>

The NCCA has had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this engagement in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Framework.  One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able to understand, interpret and use different forms of communication including gesture, expression, spoken language (English, Irish and other languages), printed text, broadcast media, and digital media.</p><p>Phase one of the consultation on the draft Primary Curriculum Framework is complete. Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which time the NCCA will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will be an opportunity for children and teachers who use ISL in schools to provide learning from their experiences in their engagement with the NCCA. It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.</p><p>In addition, a 6 week sampler module of languages in primary schools has recently been announced with schools invited to express an interest in participating.  A budget of &euro;200,000 has been provided to support the module which will support the participation of at least 100 schools.  The module will include Irish Sign Language (ISL) and will run towards the end of the first term of the 2021/22 school year.  Feedback from this module will also be used to inform the development of the Framework.  It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years.</p><p>At post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle. The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: .</p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle.  </p>  <p>  All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year. </p>  <p>  The closing date for applications for School Transport for the 2021/22 school year was 30th April 2021. The number of new mainstream applications received by Bus &Eacute;&iacute;reann for the School Transport Scheme at that date was 20,454.</p>  <p>  The number of new transport applications for pupils with special educational needs was 2,429 on 14th June 2021.</p></reply>

Registration with the Council is necessary in order to be recognized as a teacher for employment in a state funded teaching post. The registration of teachers is governed by Section 31 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 and the Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Registration Regulations 2016. There is currently no information held by the Teaching Council on the register of teachers in relation to ISL.</p>  <p>  In September 2019, a new pilot Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language) (ISL) programme for primary ITE commenced in DCU.  This is a separate CAO entry pathway into primary teaching specifically for deaf and hard of hearing students who communicate through ISL. This has been accredited by the Teaching Council and the first cohort will graduate in 2023. These students' qualification will reflect the ISL element on the Register.</p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  The total education spend on special education is about &euro;2 Billion - almost a fifth - of the annual educational and training budget. This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.</p>  <p>  Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing. In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.</p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child.</p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.</p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools.</p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings, parents/guardians and grandparents.</p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.</p>  <p>  The NCSE published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme in May 2018. The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language. It will take some time to introduce and implement this ISL scheme. In the interim these posts are filled, on a case by case basis, through the NCSE to allocate an additional SNA post with appropriate ISL qualifications. They are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school. The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  All schools have published an admissions notice which will have been published a minimum of one week prior to the admissions process taking place. The notice details the number of school places that will be available for the forthcoming year. Schools must determine how many places are available and provide this detail in the admissions notice on an annual basis. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-<font color="#001A26">Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. </font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way. </font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support  for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.  Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will  be processed in order of date received. </font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website </font></p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle.  </p>  <p>  In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  It is planned that the Steering Group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group will report to me initially on preliminary findings regarding eligibility, before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and the alignment of the scheme with other initiatives and wider Government policy.  The Steering Group has recently reported to me with this preliminary interim report which is under consideration.</p></reply>

In addition, every effort was made to ensure no barriers were erected to prevent the participation of the sector represented by the ILDN in this procurement and the request for tender reflects this. The RFT will deliver an expanded employment service in the State, thereby increasing our capacity to support more individuals who need employment assistance advice and support in securing employment. The RFT has been designed to deliver high quality employment service supports to those who are furthest from the labour market.</p>  <p> I look forward to a broad range of potential tenderers engaging in this process and to the establishment of appropriate services to assist the long-term unemployed progress towards and into employment.</p></reply>

After the medical assessment, if a person's restriction on their capacity for work is assessed as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50, 75 or 100 per cent of their existing rate, respectively.

In order to qualify, the person must be in receipt of one of two underlying schemes: Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension. </p><p>People in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (for a minimum of 6 months) who wish to return to work are eligible for PCB if their capacity for work is reduced as a result of their medical condition.</p><p>The duration a person can be in receipt of PCB is linked to the scheme that they have moved from. In the case of a person previously on Illness Benefit, the maximum duration of the 624 payment days applies, while customers who were previously in receipt of Invalidity Pension may be paid PCB for a maximum of 156 weeks.</p><p>Once the above periods have elapsed the customer may make a new application for PCB.  </p><p>A claimant should apply for PCB before commencing work and must provide the Department with a start date for the employment before payment commences. As part of the approval process, the claimant is assessed by a Medical Assessor (MA) of the Department. The personal rate of payment is based on the medical assessment of the person&rsquo;s restriction regarding their capacity to work. An MA may determine that the restriction on the person&rsquo;s capacity to work is mild, moderate, severe or profound. Where the restriction is moderate, severe or profound, the claim is conditionally approved for 50%, 75% or 100% respectively of the person's existing rate of payment. Where a person&rsquo;s capacity to work is mildly restricted, the claim is refused. </p><p>The Department does not have available the data as requested by the Deputy. The following table does, however, provide the breakdown of MA opinions for the period from March 2020 to May 2021. Not all of those assessed take up employment or become a PCB recipient. The Department does not record information regarding level of capacity on the recipient&rsquo;s claim. </p><p>For the period requested, 5% of applicants for PCB who were medically assessed were found to have a mild restriction on their capacity to work; 78% of applicants were found to be moderately affected; 15% were severe, and 2% were profound. </p><p><b>PCB Opinion by Incapacity Level from March 2020 - May 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Mild</th>       <th>Moderate</th>       <th>Severe</th>       <th>Profound</th>       <th>Sum:</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sum:</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>1192</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>1523</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 999,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible for my Department to provide an estimate of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to persons that lose their licence due to a diagnosis of epilepsy or breakthrough seizures. Information on the number of such persons is not held by my Department.  The additional cost to the scheme would also depend on factors including the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.</p>  <p>  Furthermore extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A key feature of the initiative under the Jobseeker's Allowance scheme is that it acknowledged the status of self-employed visual artists and writers and gave them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to labour market activation which is mandatory for most  recipients of jobseeker payments. </p><p>A review of the pilot was completed in 2019 in consultation with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which recommended that it should be established as a permanent scheme and extended to other professional artistic disciplines.  In September 2019 the scheme was established as a permanent Professional Artist Scheme under Jobseeker's Allowance and extended to a wide range of self-employed professional artists such as those working in theatre and music. </p><p>To avail of the scheme, a professional self-employed artist must provide a certificate or declaration from their professional body as to their status as a professional artist.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  Funding can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs, subject to submission of an application.  It is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;0.60 per child per day where a breakfast is being provided and &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch is being provided. </p>  <p>  In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Based on the 2021 budgetary allocation of &euro;65.1 million, the additional annual costs of expanding the school meals programme by 5%, 10%, 20% and 25% are &euro;3.3 million, &euro;6.5 million, &euro;13 million and &euro;16.3 million respectively.</p>  <p>  The scheme is currently available to all 887 DEIS schools, of which 144 are not availing of the breakfast or snack and 199 are not availing of lunch.  If all DEIS schools not currently availing of the breakfast and lunch options were to apply to be included the estimated additional cost would be &euro;9.6m annually. </p>  <p>  Changes to increase the funding of any scheme administered by my Department would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch club is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner club is being provided and &euro;2.90 per child per day where a Hot Meal club is being provided.  Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and delivered to the school. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option. </p>  <p>  There are currently 20,648 students receiving a hot meal in 2020/2021, at a cost of &euro;4.4m.  The cost per child per day is &euro;2.90.  The cost per school is dependent upon the number of pupils availing of the hot meal option in each school.</p>  <p>  It would cost some &euro;71m to provide a hot meal to every student currently availing of the scheme in primary schools.  To provide hot meals to students availing of the scheme in secondary schools would cost just under &euro;33m.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing a hot meal at &euro;2.90 to all students in DEIS primary schools would be &euro;56.6m.</p>  <p>  Changes to the level of funding of any scheme administered by my Department would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs. Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market.</p>  <p>  At the onset of the Covid-19 emergency last year my Department introduced a number of contingency measures to support CE schemes including the extension of participant contracts.  With the progressive re-opening of the economy and other areas of society, and in line with the Governments National Recovery Plan and the further extension of supports put in place since the start of the pandemic, it has been decided that current CE participants who have been due to exit their schemes since 30th October 2020,will have their contracts extended to November 2021 and will exit CE on a phased basis during November 2021. This extension will afford the person concerned additional time to complete training .</p>  <p>  During his time on CE, the person concerned  achieved QQI awards and the purpose of this training and support was to prepare him for full-time sustainable employment .The Department's Employment Support Service can work with the person concerned to ensure that the benefits and experience he received during his time on CE are maximised. This process will help identify potential employment opportunities and offer support to him in overcoming any barriers to employment.</p></reply>

Government acknowledges that some sectors will continue to be impacted and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme will be extended beyond 30 June 2021 for existing claimants who continue to be eligible for payment.  To allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, a transitional approach will be taken with PUP payments reduced on a tapered basis over 6 months from next September.

Parent's Benefit differs in that it can be taken in individual periods of a week over a period of 24 months.

This provision also applies to directors of limited companies who work as paid employees in their company. The WSS is an employment support to private sector employers, the objective of which is to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities and thereby increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market. The incentive is intended to encourage employers to take on new employees and the scheme provides financial incentives to employers to hire new staff with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment. The employee must be subject to and have the same rights as per the conditions of employment as any of their other employees. These conditions include the payment of Class A PRSI contributions. As the WSS is a demand-led scheme, there is no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the increased costs resulting from permitting those who are self-employed to avail of the schemes. </p><p>However, my Department provides a wide range of employment-related supports for persons with disabilities seeking to enter self-employment. </p><p><b><i>Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension.</i></b></p><p>The Disability Allowance and Blind Pension schemes are structured to support persons with a disability to achieve their employment ambitions - either in self-employment or as an employee.</p><p>Where a person in receipt of either payment commences employment or self-employment the first &euro;140 of weekly earnings will be disregarded in the means test associated with the payment, while only half of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are assessed. </p><p>Resulting from a measure in Budget 2021, as of this month (June) the earnings disregards for both schemes increased by &euro;20, from ?120 to &euro;140 per week. </p><p><b><i>Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit.</i></b></p><p>Persons in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for a minimum of 26 weeks) and who wish to enter or re-enter employment or self-employment can apply for the Partial Capacity Benefit scheme. </p><p>The personal rate of payment of Partial Capacity Benefit is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work, whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and their current rate of payment.

The funding for this programme will amount to around &euro;16 million over a three-year period and is being provided jointly under the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) Operational Programme 2014-2020 and the Irish Exchequer. The programme will support over 2,600 young people with disabilities between 15 and 29 years of age. Pobal has been contracted by my Department to manage the programme.</p><p>The aim of the Ability Programme is to help bring young people with disabilities who are not work-ready closer to the labour market through engagement in training and personal development activities, which would be followed by an incremental exposure to work. The programme is being delivered by 27 community and voluntary groups from around the country, selected on foot of a competitive process.  The projects being funded have been designed to assist young people in their transition from school to further education and employment. </p><p>The WALK PEER organisation is funded as a standalone project under the Ability Programme and not as a programme in its own right. The project aims to support 200 young people with special educational needs aged 15-24 years within 3 special schools&rsquo; settings to develop their employment aspirations, identify their career goals and to experience work in the open labour market. Total Ability funding of &euro;640,848 has been awarded to WALK PEER over the course of the 3-year programme.  </p><p>If the WALK PEER project was to be replicated on the same scale to an additional 25 counties, based on a simple scale up calculation, this would require additional funding in excess of &euro;5m per year.  </p><p>It should be noted that Walkinstown Green Social Enterprises Limited, which is wholly owned by WALK Ltd, was also awarded &euro;430,175 under the Ability Programme to fund the WALK REAL Project, bringing the total combined amount of funding to WALK Ltd to &euro;1,071,023 over the course of the Ability Programme.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment of an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) in addition to the personal rate of payment reflects these additional household needs.</p><p>The IQA is payable in respect of a person who is wholly or mainly maintained by the customer regardless of whether the couple are married or not. Where one member of a cohabiting couple claims a means-tested social assistance payment, their partner's income is taken into account in the means test.  </p><p>The social welfare and tax systems have evolved over time and in response to a variety of factors, including Constitutional imperatives as interpreted by the Courts, changing social trends and EU Directives. The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v </i>Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the current treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code. The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.  This means that for social assistance means tested schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are treated in the same manner. </p><p>Income tax arrangements for married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The Strategy will also set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-Covid labour market with an overall target of increasing the caseload capacity by 100,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Another key element of the national Economic Recovery Plan is the establishment of a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme, which has a target of 10,000 participants by end-2022, will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch this new work placement programme alongside the Pathways to Work Strategy, in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CE participants, whose contracts were due to end during the periods of restrictions, have had their contracts extended for the duration of those restrictions.</p>  <p>  With the successful continuing roll-out of the vaccine programme and in accordance with the phased re-opening of the economy by Government, my priority and the priority of the Department is to get all CE and Tus schemes back up and running so that they can fully re-commence activities, providing work experience and training opportunities to long term unemployment participants and delivering vital services to local communities. I met with a number of CE and T&uacute;s schemes last Friday and we had a very constructive exchange of views on the very real challenges facing these employment support schemes, as the economy and society begins to recover from the pandemic over the coming months. </p>  <p>  At the end of last week, the Minister for Social Protection, Minister Humphreys and I announced that the current CE and T&uacute;s participants' contract extension date will be further extended until 29 October 2021.  This will bring to over 11,000  CE and T&uacute;s participants, benefitting from various contract extensions going back to  October, 2020. There will be further transitional arrangements for the cohort of CE and T&uacute;s participants whose contracts are due to come to an end from the start of November 2021 to February 2022. These final contract extensions will provide all participants with additional time to complete their training and benefit from work experience on CE.  </p>  <p>The conclusion of CE and T&uacute;s participant contracts after the 29 October 2021 will be undertaken on a coordinated and phased basis over a number of months up to February.  This approach will support the recruitment of new participants while also ensuring the ongoing delivery of important community services.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve the programmes for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

The fundamental purpose of the review is to provide key data and information to support the future development of the NCS. The review will provide a basis for the Department to consider how effectively the NCS is operating. </p><p>The review is an independent assessment of the implementation and impacts of the NCS during its first year of operation, and a specialist research company, Frontier Economics, has been procured to undertake this work. As part of the evidence gathering and analysis, a number of methods have been undertaken in the review approach. These include: </p><p>- A comprehensive review and analysis of the administrative/management data amassed since the Scheme launch. </p><p>- Consultation with parents and providers using the NCS was carried out in May 2021, with the aim of gathering information on parental and childcare provider experience of engaging with the NCS during its first year of operation. There was a considerable response to the survey with 3,242 parental responses and 969 provider responses. A further 238 responses were also received from providers who have not yet contracted to the NCS. The data from the surveys is currently being examined by the consultant. </p><p>- Supplemental interviews with a sample of representative stakeholders who have engaged over the past year on the NCS. </p><p>- A review of the comprehensive and intensive consultations conducted as a part of the review of the funding model. </p><p>- A review of reports and assessments conducted throughout the NCS launch process and across the past year. </p><p>- A review of submissions received from a variety of stakeholders since the Scheme launched including a number of submissions, which were received from providers or community organisations in disadvantaged communities. </p><p>All of these engagements and reviews will include data and submissions encompassing providers serving disadvantaged communities. The review itself has a number of specific tasks with regard to considering the impact on families who may be experiencing socio-economic disadvantage as this is a key objective of the Scheme itself. The terms of reference include: </p><p>- Uptake of the NCS with a particular emphasis on families from lowest income groups or most disadvantaged households; single parent households; families where one assessable member of the household is not in work or study; families targeted by specific sponsor interventions according to need; and uptake of the universal element of the NCS;  </p><p>- The issue of sustainability for services in disadvantaged (and other) areas, particularly with regard to feedback from some services that the Scheme design has impacted their sustainability. </p><p>Separately, an Expert Group to design a new funding model for childcare, is currently undertaking a comprehensive programme of consultation and engagement to inform its work. This is comprised of three phases. Phase 1 took place between August and December 2020, and consisted of a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars, nine focused discussion sessions with providers and practitioners, and seven focused discussion sessions with parents. Phase 2 took place over April and May 2021 and involved four facilitated events that brought together a range of participants to examine in depth issues of affordability, sustainability, quality and inclusion. Phase 3 is set to build on Phases 1 and 2 and takes place in July 2021. </p><p>Frontier Economics is facilitating Phases 2 and 3 of the consultation with participants from the organisations that are part of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum (ELCSF). Reports from Phase 1 of the consultation and engagement, along with other material relating to the Funding Model including Expert Group meeting documentation and research papers, are available on a dedicated website at <i>www.first5fundingmodel.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The Act also makes provision for the recognition of cohabitant agreements which regulate the shared financial affairs of cohabiting couples and enable couples to opt out of the application to them of the redress scheme.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution accords constitutional protection to the family based on marriage.  </p><p>The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality, which published its recommendations on 24 April 2021, recommended the amendment of Article 41 of the Constitution so that it would protect private and family life, with the protection afforded to the family not limited to the marital family.  </p><p>The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment that the Government will respond to each recommendation of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality. The Citizens' Assembly's recommendations are currently being considered by the Oireachtas which will identify potential next steps in this regard.</p></reply>

Everyone has a role to play in preparing young people to reach their developmental milestones. </p><p>Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. In response to the new legislative provision, Tusla has developed a suite of policies and guidance documents for aftercare support, which includes guidance on direct financial support. </p><p>The most prominent form of such support is the aftercare allowance, which is provided to cover a young person&rsquo;s day to day costs as they progress in education or accredited training. The core age range for eligibility for aftercare is 18 to 21 years of age. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. For those young adults who are not in education / training at 18 years, aftercare services support them in accessing any relevant financial allowances and support to which they may be entitled from the Department of Social Protection or other agencies. The amount of financial support an adult will receive at 18 years and the relevant agency or Department will be specific to each adult&rsquo;s circumstances.</p></reply>

A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised ELC and SAC. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available. </p><p>The supply of, and demand for, ELC and SAC places is currently monitored annually through the Early Years Sector Profile report conducted by Pobal on behalf of my Department. While enrolment data for 2019/20 was not available owing to COVID-19, data from previous years demonstrates increases in capacity.</p><p>Capacity is calculated by summing the number of children enrolled and vacant places. Figures are extrapolated to represent 100% of services. Overall extrapolated figures show an increase from 202,082 places overall in in 2016/2017 figures to 218,745 in 2018/2019, representing an overall increase in capacity of 6% which is equivalent to 16,663 places.  </p><p>Capacity figures broken down by 'session type' are higher than overall capacity figures as children may participate in more than one session (e.g. breakfast club and after-school). Table 1 presents change in capacity over time by session type. These figures highlight an increase in capacity of part-time places from 28,467 in 2016/2017 to 29,447 in 2018/2019.Capacity recorded for both after-school care and breakfast club places increased over this time; from 37,139 to 44,499 and 8,120 to 12,478 respectively. </p><p>Table 1: Capacity by session type <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2016/2017 </th>       <th>2017/2018 </th>       <th>2018/2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>After-school</td>       <td>37,139 </td>       <td>44,499</td>       <td>51,855  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Breakfast club</td>       <td>8,120</td>       <td>12,478</td>       <td>14,469  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drop-in</td>       <td>568</td>       <td>877 </td>       <td>1,024 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Full day care</td>       <td>37,078</td>       <td>44,435 </td>       <td>46,568 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overnight services</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Part-time</td>       <td>28,467</td>       <td>30,219 </td>       <td>29,447 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sessional</td>       <td>113,922  </td>       <td>116,187 </td>       <td>108,366 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Pre-COVID, the creation of new places was a key commitment of my Department&rsquo;s capital programmes, with 27, 433 additional places created since 2015. Many community facilities, and some private facilities, were built using public investment through the major capital investment programmes, Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (2000-2006) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (2006-2011).  Since then, annual capital programmes have provided investment for establishment of new provision, expansion of services, quality improvements and maintenance and upgrades to existing facilities in both the private and community sector.</p><p>First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families commits to maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised early learning and childcare to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families. To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040, and the development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC.</p><p>An Expert Group has been convened to examine the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group will recommend how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted to me in November 2021.</p></reply>

The initiative will see grants, supports and information resources rolled out over the summer months, creating opportunities for children and their families to enjoy play and the outdoors.  </p><p>As part of the Summer of Play launch, I announced &euro;6 million in funding. The funding is being rolled out through two grants, as follows:</p><p><b>1.

Play and Recreation Capital Grant: </b>&euro;450,000 has been allocated for the purpose of this grant, which is designed to fund the refurbishment and development of playgrounds and play areas across the country. Notifications of approved funding have issued to the Local Authorities for the completion of successful projects, 52 across all 31 Local Authorities, in 2021.  The projects funded by this grant encompass a wide range of initiatives that will deliver diverse benefits to children and young people and have a positive impact on communities.

The advice from the public health experts is that as long as social distancing measures are in place, play-pods will be required in services.</p><p>It is the Department's view that most services should be able to comply with the HPSC guidance with little or no reduction in capacity or hours offered.</p><p>It must be noted that this Department is not the owner/employer of services; they are private businesses and specific decisions on whether, when and how to open (including operational hours) are a matter for the individual service provider. Services must examine, in the context of their own settings, how best to apply the guidance and how best to structure play-pods.</p></reply>

The National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 commits to ensuring that the practice of conversion therapy in Ireland is investigated and followed up with appropriate counter measures.</p><p>The research subgroup of the Inclusion Strategy has now been established and met for the first time on 19 May.

Throughout its 6 years of operation there was extensive correspondence between my Department and the independent Commission. This correspondence involves exchanges between myself, previous Ministers and multiple officials within my Department and the Commission, its legal and administrative staff.  </p><p>The scope of the Deputy&rsquo;s request includes correspondence in relation to diverse matters, including, but not limited to: the setup of the Commission; human resources and administrative arrangements; expenditure and financial governance; guidelines on legal and witness costs; the discovery of records; the submission of and responses to matters arising in interim and final reports, and transfer of the Commission's archive.</p><p>Due to the number of parties to this correspondence, these records are not compiled under the responsibility of one centralised area of my Department. Coupled with the additional complexities of remote working, the collation of all correspondence between my Department and the Commission of Investigation would therefore be a substantial undertaking. </p><p>Taking account of the volume of correspondence involved, it is not be possible for my Department to provide the information requested within the timescale available. However, I am eager to assist the Deputy in her query to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>If the Deputy could consider her request in light of the points made above, and narrow the scope of the nature of the correspondence she is seeking, my officials will endeavour to assist her as much as possible.  My officials would also be happy to speak directly to the Deputy if that would assist in focusing the scope of the correspondence sought.</p><p>I would note, of course, that the timescale for responding in full to the request will depend on the volume of correspondence that may be sought. </p></reply>

The objective of these supports have been to:</p><p>- support providers&rsquo; sustainability to enable services return to normal once restrictions were lifted; </p><p>- support providers to retain their staff; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could reopen and remain open, even at very low levels of occupancy; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could operate safely for children, families and staff; </p><p>Ensure that increased costs associated with public health requirements, and lower demand / occupancy were not passed on to parents; </p><p>- achieve administrative efficiency through the continued use of existing funding schemes and other whole of economy supports; and </p><p>- protect exchequer investment.</p><p>Supports in 2020 included:</p><p>- The continuation of DCEDIY subsidy schemes on an ex-gratia basis (12 March &ndash; 5 April 2020); </p><p>- The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (6 April &ndash; 28 June 2020); which was layered on top of the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and provided a top-up for wages of eligible early learning and care and school-age childcare staff and a further payment to be used towards ongoing/non-deferrable operational costs such as rent, insurance and ICT.</p><p>- The Reopening Funding Package, (29 June &ndash; 23 August 2020), which included a once-off Reopening Support Payment (RSP), a once-off Covid-19 capital grant; continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated TWSS and resumption of DCEDIY subsidy schemes (NCS, CCSP, TEC).</p><p>- The July Stimulus Package (from 24 August to end December 2020) which included the continuation of all DCEDIY subsidy schemes (NCS, CCSP, TEC), the resumption of the ECCE Programme, the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and a Sustainability Fund. </p><p>The table below shows the DCEDIY 2020 allocations and the amounts drawn down for the ELC/SAC sector across DCEDIY subsidy schemes and Covid-19 supports. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Allocation     2020 (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Expenditure (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ECCE</td>       <td>&euro;208.60</td>       <td>&euro;216.60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AIM</td>       <td>&euro;31.40</td>       <td>&euro;17.40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NCS     and Savers</td>       <td>&euro;145.20</td>       <td>&euro;109.40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19 TWSCS</td>       <td>&euro;77.30</td>       <td>&euro;56.60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19   RSP</td>       <td>&euro;18.0</td>       <td>&euro;13.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19   Capital</td>       <td>&euro;14.2</td>       <td>&euro;13.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sustainability   Support Funds</td>       <td>&euro;2.2</td>       <td>&euro;0.8</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The underspend among the DCEDIY subsidy schemes in 2020 was primarily driven by the closures of the ELC/SAC sector from 12 March to 28 June 2020. However, this is not a full reflection of total State funding for the ELC/ SAC sector in 2020. </p><p>Funding under the Revenue-operated TWSS for the ELC/SAC sector is estimated to have cost <b>&euro;128m</b>in 2020. This is an unreconciled figure provided from Revenue and the final figure is likely to be reduced. Moreover, up to end of 2020, it is estimated that <b>&euro;115m</b>was provided to the sector under the EWSS, also from Revenue. </p><p>In addition to the DCEDIY allocation, the TWSS and the EWSS, the sector also benefitted from other State supports in 2020, including freezing of commercial rates; many chose the Restart Grant rather than the RSP; and 1,000 sole traders accessed the Pandemic Unemployment Payment at &euro;350 per week rather than the EWSS during the temporary closures.</p><p>In addition to the DCEDIY subsidy schemes in 2021, there has also been a number of tailored funding supports from DCEDIY in 2021 to respond to Level 5 restrictions in the post-Christmas period. These included a Covid-19 Operating Support Payment and a new Covid-19 strand of the Sustainability Fund. These are in addition to the EWSS.</p><p>The table below shows the DCEDIY 2021 allocations and the amounts drawn down for the ELC/SAC sector across DCEDIY subsidy schemes and Covid-19 supports to date. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Allocation 2021     (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Expenditure (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ECCE</td>       <td>&euro;289.30</td>       <td>&euro;164.30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AIM</td>       <td>&euro;35.00</td>       <td>&euro;11.40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NCS     and Savers</td>       <td>&euro;205.50</td>       <td>&euro;78.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>COVID-19 Operational     Support Payment</td>       <td>&euro;                                        -</td>       <td>&euro;12.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>ELC/SAC employers continue to be entitled to access the EWSS with an exemption to having to demonstrate the drop in turnover that applies to other sectors.  Since October 2020, EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates and these rates are estimated to cover, on average, 80% of staff costs in the sector, or 50% of total operating costs. The weekly cost of EWSS at enhanced rates to the sector is estimated to be &euro;7.4m. EWSS at enhanced rates are in place until end Q3 2021.</p><p>There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of these supports.  </p><p>- The data on services that have closed and opened in 2020 are directly comparable to 2019 so there has been no loss of capacity: </p><p>- 197 services that were on the Early Years Register reported permanent closure to Tusla in 2020 compared to 196 in 2019.  </p><p>- 91 new services were registered in 2020 compared to 93 in 2019. </p><p>Data from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners indicates that the number of employees in the sector has not changed substantially over the course of the pandemic </p><p>Data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2020 Survey revealed no significant increase in fees charged to parents. Fieldwork for the 2021 is currently underway and will allow for further analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 and the measures taken by the DCEDIY and the State to support the sector.  I anticipate this data being available in the coming months.  </p></reply>

The schemes are administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. </p><p>My Department introduced a number of supports to mitigate against impacts of COVID-19 on the Early Learning and Care and School- Age Childcare Sector in 2020 and has continued to provide supports in 2021. </p><p>From early January 2021, due to ongoing COVID-19 Level 5 restrictions, the pre-school (ECCE) programme was suspended while other Early Learning and Care Services were open to children </p><p>whose parents work in an essential service and for vulnerable children only. </p><p>During this period in January  2021,  services received funding as normal with ECCE only services, forced to close, paid under Force Majeure.  </p><p>Following continuation of Level 5 restrictions in February, where the pre-school (ECCE) programme continued to be suspended, funding for the period 01 February to 05 March 2021 for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare Services was as follows:</p><p>- Services open during this period will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP), and the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)) These services can also receive the additional 30% of the value of ECCE Programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that includes waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible.  </p><p>- Services closed during this period, where the closure is approved by the Department, will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. NCS, CCSP, and AIM). This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible.</p><p>- A newly designed Covid-19 Support Payment is being put in place to support some providers with a significant reliance on parental fee income to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable.  </p><p>The table below shows the funding provided to services during the period 01 February to 05 March 2021 at 70% rate and at 100% rate. It should be noted that the 30% top-up was calculated weekly and in some instances, services were received a mix of 100% and 70% rate.

These schemes are administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.</p><p>Data captured in a survey administered to all centre-based providers nationally in 2018 as part of the Review of the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare Services provided a breakdown of provider income.  That Review found that parental fees accounted for, on average, 40% of all overall service income, with the remainder coming from State funding. Data from the Review also found that for over 70% of services, 30% or less of their income came from parental fees. Reliance on parental fees can vary considerably across service types. Services which only or primarily deliver the ECCE programme are likely to have little or no reliance on parental fees. See the following table for a detailed breakdown. </p><p><b>2018 Breakdown of % ELC Providers Income from Parental Fees</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>% of income from parental fees</th>       <th>Percentage of ELC providers</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0%</td>       <td>32.4%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;0-10%</td>       <td>21.9%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;10-20%</td>       <td>10.5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;20-30%</td>       <td>6.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;30-40%</td>       <td>5.2%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;40-50%</td>       <td>4.9%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;50-60%</td>       <td>4.5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;60-70%</td>       <td>5.1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;70-80%</td>       <td>3.7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;80-90%</td>       <td>2.8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>100%</td>       <td>2.4%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2019, &euro;497m of funding was allocated directly to services through my Department's ELC schemes. Assuming the same income breakdown for ELC providers as 2018, this funding accounted for approximately 60% of the ELC sector income. It can thus be deduced that approximately &euro;331m (40%) of the ELC sector income came from parental fees in 2019.</p><p>Due to the significant disruption to the ELC sector in 2020 and 2021, and the various funding packages provided to support services through Covid-19 related periods of closures and restricted access, some of which had as a requirement of that funding to waive fees for parents not accessing ELC during those periods, it is not possible to provide relevant comparable data for these time periods.</p></reply>

The additional AIM funding allows for a further increase in the number of children with disabilities who can receive targeted supports under AIM, and enabled an increase in the level of payment made to services for additional assistance under Level 7 of AIM. Level 7 capitation increased in January of this year from &euro;195 per week (or &euro;13/hour) to &euro;210 per week (or &euro;14/hr). The additional funding in the 2021 budget also allows for an increase in the number of funded Inclusion Coordinator roles in preschool services. </p><p>The under-spend in 2020 reflects the availability of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to registered providers of early learning and care and school-age childcare. This was a significant support in helping service providers to meet the challenges of COVID-19. </p><p>EWSS provides wage subsidies for relevant staff members, including newly hired staff. Level 7 of AIM (additional assistance in the preschool room) provides financial assistance to service providers that may be used to cover or subsidise the wages of specific staff members. With the introduction of EWSS, AIM rules were amended to allow the wages of an employee delivering additional assistance in the preschool room to be supported through either the EWSS or AIM Level 7 capitation, but not both. It was open to a service provider to choose whichever of EWSS or AIM Level 7 funding was most appropriate to them. </p><p>To date, Pobal data shows over 1,089 AIM Level 7 applications were withdrawn by service providers citing a preference to hire a staff member using EWSS funds rather than AIM funding. These withdrawals account for a drop in AIM Level 7 applications by approximately 25%. As this information is submitted on a voluntary basis, the number of withdrawals due to EWSS funding may be higher than reported. This reductions in the number of AIM Level 7 applications, in addition to a possible drop off in the number of children with disabilities attending services due to Covid-19, has had a major impact on AIM Level 7 expenditure in 2020 and 2021. There are currently 109,242 approved ECCE registrations, which is 3% lower than this time last year. The combination of lower ECCE registrations and the continuation of EWSS will continue to impact on AIM expenditure until at least the end of Q3 2021. </p><p>The Access Inclusion Model (AIM), which is an inter-agency initiative led by my Department, supports the participation of preschool children with disabilities in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE Programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality preschool education. AIM is based on the needs of the child in the context of the preschool setting. It does not require any diagnosis, recognising that many children do not have a diagnosis of a disability when starting preschool. </p><p>AIM has seven levels of progressive support. Universal supports (levels 1-3) empower early learning and care providers to create a more inclusive culture in their setting through an Inclusion Charter and Guidelines for preschools, and a level 6 qualification in Leadership for Inclusion (LINC).</p><p>Targeted supports (levels 4-7) are based on the needs of the child and the preschool setting they are attending. These supports include expert early years educational advice from Better Start Early Years Specialists, capital grants for special equipment and/or minor alterations for preschool settings, and therapy supports. AIM level 7 support provides additional funding to preschools who have a child requiring extra support. Providers can use this funding either to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the preschool room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting.</p></reply>

The Action Plan aims to improve access, through childminding, to high quality and affordable childcare. The Action Plan sets out a pathway over the next 8 years towards regulation, support and subsidies for all paid, non-relative childminders. The Action Plan will involve change and will bring significant benefits for childminders, and for the children and the families using their services.</p><p>A National Action Plan for Childminding Steering Group will be established shortly, to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan.<b></b>The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and consultation and communications.</p><p>The National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders on the Steering Group, which will be chaired by my Department. Additionally the National Action Plan  commits to representation of childminders on all four Advisory Groups.</p><p>Initial work on drafting a role profile for childminders began prior to launch of the National Action Plan, in the context of on-going work on developing a Workforce Development Plan for early learning and care and school-age childcare. In order to draft proposals, a working group was established specifically on childminding. The working group has strong representation of childminding views. Of its 12 members, six are childminders or work exclusively with or for childminders, while other members represent the views of parents, the statutory regulator (Tusla) and organisations which have provided extensive support for childminders. All decisions on the design and implementation of training programmes for childminders will be made by the Steering Group of the National Action Plan for Childminding.</p><p>The National Action Plan itself was based on extensive consultation and engagement with childminders, and the blueprint for the National Action Plan was the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which was coordinated and chaired by Childminding Ireland. The National Action Plan commits to further consultation with childminders, especially during Phase 1 of the Plan when developing regulations specific to childminders.</p></reply>

It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement. </p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commencing the 2015 Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform that it represents.  We are working towards a date of June 2022 for full commencement.  </p>  <p>  The delays in commencement of the 2015 Act arise from two principal factors.  The Decision Support Service, which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act, has to become operational and to be able to respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to be enacted by year end.  I will shortly seek Government approval for the General Scheme of the Bill.  The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>Some provisions of the Act have been commenced to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service; the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group in relation to Advance Healthcare Directives; and most recently, on the 1st   of February this year, the repeal of the Marriage of Lunatics Act, which means that a ward can now marry if she or he has capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  To this end a budget of &euro;5.8 million was secured for the Decision Support Service for 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, meets monthly to oversee and drive progress towards full commencement.  The Steering Group comprises senior officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Decision Support Service, recognising that successful operation of the 2015 Act will involve multiple stakeholders.  They are working towards commencement of the 2015 Act in June 2022, with the Decision Support Service opening for business immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

Since its development 12 years ago it has been used as a tool to support quality on many levels across the range of services that support the learning and care of children from birth to 6 years old. Aistear is relevant to all settings for children from birth to 6 years old, and it includes suggestions on ways in which parents can support their children's early learning. Measures to support the use of Aistear are rolled out in an integrated way with supports for the S&iacute;olta national quality framework.</p><p>Given the diverse ways in which use of Aistear is currently supported, and its integrated roll-out with S&iacute;olta, it is not possible at present to give a single figure for the cost of rolling out Aistear across the early learning and care sector.</p><p>The roll-out of Aistear, which is supported by the Aistear-S&iacute;olta Practice Guide (published in 2015), is embedded in initial/pre-service training programmes (leading to qualifications at Levels 5, 6, 7 and 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications/NFQ) and in a range of training courses aimed at the continuing professional development of early learning and care practitioners.</p><p>Its roll-out is also embedded in the mentoring work carried out by the Better Start Quality Development Service, and in the inspections of early learning and care services that are carried out by both Tusla (the statutory regulator for early learning and care and school-age childcare services) and the Inspectorate of the Department of Education. </p><p>Progress continues to be made in the on-going roll-out of Aistear and S&iacute;olta across the sector. Recent initiatives include on-going work to reform and strengthen the training awards at Levels 5 and 6 on the NFQ and undergraduate degree programmes, including further embedding Aistear and S&iacute;olta within these awards. </p><p>The National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative (NSAI) is a collaboration (begun in 2016) between my Department, the Department of Education, Better Start, and the NCCA. The purpose of the NSAI is to support the implementation of both Aistear and the S&iacute;olta national quality framework. Training courses delivered within the NSAI include both foundation or introductory courses that give the background and fundamentals of S&iacute;olta and Aistear (4 workshops, delivered through the City and County Childcare Committees) and the Aistear and Play CPD programme (which is delivered by the Better Start Quality Development Service). The budget for the NSAI in 2021 is &euro;500,000.</p><p>The Aistear and Play CPD programme has been delivered by Better Start since March 2019. It consists of 5 individual workshops (two and a half hours each) and two on-site support visits with an early years mentor to support services to apply the learning from the training course within their setting. In 2019 the National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative offered 60 Aistear and Play CPD courses, with 15-20 participants per course.  Roll-out in 2020 and 2021 has been interrupted by Covid-19. </p><p>An evaluation of the Better Start Quality Development Service will begin shortly, and a review of the Aistear and Play CPD programme has recently been carried out. The results of these evaluations will help to identify the next steps in the roll-out of Aistear.</p></reply>

The Scheme is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. The universal subsidy is available to all families with children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later). The universal subsidy is based on the child&rsquo;s age, and not on family income levels.</p>  <p>  It is assumed that the &euro;20 referred to in the question refers to the maximum universal rate as it existed prior to Budget 20.  The maximum universal subsidy has increased from &euro;20 per week to &euro;22.50 per week since September 2020. </p>  <p>  The current cost of a universal subsidy is &euro;0.50 per hour and this equates to a maximum of &euro;22.50 per week per child. Increasing the universal subsidy to &euro;100 per week for 45 hours would require a subsidy of &euro;2.22 per hour and  would increase the total scheme cost by approximately &euro;65million per annum. This costing also includes the cost of applying &euro;100 as a base rate for the income assessed subsidies.</p>  <p>  These figures are calculated using a funding model of the NCS which is based on key assumptions around the preferences and behaviours of parents relating to working hours and childcare choice, rates of growth in demand, and certain metrics are extrapolated from available data. It is also based on a return to the expected growth levels which were estimated prior to the impact of Covid-19. </p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. </p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. </p>  <p>  Based on figures available from the Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2018/19, of approximately 26,000 staff working directly with children, it is estimated that 60% (or 15,600) are paid below &euro;12.30 per hour and 40% (or 10,400) are paid &euro;12.30 or more.</p>  <p>  On this basis, it can be estimated that the annual cost of raising the wages of all early learning and care  and school-age childcare practitioners to at least &euro;12.30 per hour would be approximately &euro;30 million. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of employer PRSI and holiday pay would be &euro;6m, bringing the total cost to &euro;36m.</p>  <p>  My Department does not currently have a breakdown of this cost specifically for raising the wages for practitioners who hold a level 5 award as their highest qualification. It should be noted that a proportion of those working in the sector who have qualifications higher than level 5 (at levels 6, 7 and 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications) also earn less than &euro;12.30 per hour. For example, while data from the 2018/19 Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile shows the average wage of practitioners with a level 6 qualification to be &euro;12.63 per hour, the average wage for early years assistants working in non-ECCE rooms who have a Level 6 qualification was &euro;11.18 per hour. </p></reply>

The objectives of the NCS are to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation, tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for thousands of families, and establish a sustainable platform for investment in the Irish childcare sector for decades to come. </p><p>The NCS entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies. The universal subsidy is available to all families with children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later). The universal subsidy is based on the child&rsquo;s age, and not on family income levels. Parents do not have to undergo an assessment to avail of this subsidy. The universal subsidy is currently provided at a rate of &euro;0.50 per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place up to a maximum of 45 hours a week.</p><p>As the universal subsidy is underpinned by age, an increase in the number of children availing of the subsidy is not associated to an increase of universal rate levels.

The total number of children accessing the NCS is estimated to rise from September 2021 to 48,000 by the end of 2021.

One of the strands was the appointment of Childminding Advisory Officers, some of whom were employed by the HSE and some by City and County Childcare Committees. Their roles included offering information, support and training to childminders; maintaining the voluntary notification system; and administering other supports for childminders. The Childminding Advisory Officer posts were largely discontinued in 2012-2013 in the context of widespread budget cuts at that time. </p>  <p>  In 2019 my Department put in place a National Childminding Coordinator, who is located within the Department, and 6 Childminding Development Officers, who are located within City and County Childcare Committees around the country and who have a regional remit. Their role is to prepare the childminding sector for the move towards wider regulation and in the immediate term to support childminders who are subject to the current regulations but are not yet registered with Tusla to meet Tusla registration requirements, thus enabling more childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme. The cost of these posts is &euro;500,000 per annum, which includes costs for salaries, PRSI, travel and subsistence and overheads.

The public's engagement in these matters was further informed by comprehensive print, broadcast and on-line media coverage of the arrangements for the Commission. The subsequent activities of the Commission of Investigation garnered substantial media attention throughout its 6 years of operation. I make this initial point in recognition of the fact that communication is much broader than the amount spent on commercial advertising and media campaigns.</p><p>In accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, it must be recognised that the statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was independent in the conduct of its investigations. As such, I had no role in the operational decisions of the Commission in the discharge of its functions, which included public communications of the arrangements for engagement with the Commission and its Confidential Committee. </p><p>The Commission was provided with a delegated sanction to directly recruit the staff, experts and specialist personnel it deemed necessary.  Appropriate funding was allocated annually to support salaries, professional fees and other operational costs relating to the work of the Commission and its engagement with former residents and other witnesses. The Commission established a website which it used to publicise its contact details, provide updates and other relevant information. </p><p>Those who contributed to the investigation did so by appearing before the Commissioners, either voluntarily or by direction of the Commission, or by providing accounts of their experience on a wholly voluntary basis to the Confidential Committee, which was specifically set up to hear from survivors as informally as possible in the circumstances. It is evident from the Commission's final report that many individuals living outside the jurisdiction contributed to its work. </p><p>My Department has always been cognisant of the intense public interest in this deeply sensitive inquiry, and fulfilled its role by publishing the reports submitted by the Commission and publicising the separate activities designed to engage directly with survivors while the independent inquiry was on-going.  My Department did this through our website, social media platforms, and latterly through the development of a mailing list to facilitate email communication directly to those who provided their contact details to the Department. </p><p>The Commission's repeated calls for persons with relevant information to come forward during the course of the inquiry were endorsed by the Department and Ministers.

This scheme will include a restorative recognition payment and a form of enhanced medical card. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) was established to develop detailed proposals for the Restorative Recognition Scheme, which must then be brought to Government for approval. To support and inform the work of the IDG, a public consultation process took place during March and April. This public consultation was undertaken by OAK Conflict Dynamics ('OAK') on behalf of my Department. The input from survivors to that consultation is invaluable in order to develop a scheme that will have their needs at its core. </p>  <p>  My Department spent approximately &euro;161,700 excluding VAT in March 2021 on advertising and publicity costs associated with the public consultation for the Restorative Recognition Scheme. </p>  <p>  This included &euro;154,656 excluding VAT on publicising the call for submissions in local and national Irish newspapers (including Northern Ireland) and on various social media platforms via our contracted media agency, Mindshare Limited. Additionally, an amount of &euro;4,558 excluding VAT was paid to Kick Communications for typesetting and artwork for the print advertisement.</p>  <p>  A further sum of &pound;1,750.00 excluding VAT was spent via Embassy London for advertisements in two newspapers targeting the Irish community in the UK and $550 was spent via the Embassy Washington for advertisements in US based Irish Community newspapers</p>  <p>  I was delighted with the strong response to the consultation process. Approximately 450 written submissions were received and 17 online meetings were held to meet demand. 'OAK' submitted their final report on the consultation process to the IDG on 17th May.</p>  <p>  The work of the IDG is almost complete and they will deliver their report to me very soon. Following this, I will submit recommendations to Government for a decision on the Scheme. </p></reply>

Data for the Review was captured in a survey on income and costs administered to centre-based providers in 2018 and breaks down key cost components for providers. </p><p>The Review found that payroll accounts for an average of 70% of all overall costs incurred by services. Utilities and overheads account for 7% on average, with premises costs accounting for 6% on average. The remainder of costs include materials and equipment, consumables,professional and bank fees and other costs. There was some variation by service type in the proportion of costs that pay accounts for; payroll accounted for 68% of costs for private providers, and 78% for community providers.</p><p>The report also provides analysis of the proportion of income that services receive from public funding and parental fees. The study found that State funding accounted for, on average, 60% of all overall service income, with the remainder coming from parental fees. Data from the report also indicates that for over 70% of services, 30% or less of their income comes from parental fees. Reliance on parental fees can vary considerably across service types. </p><p>The full report and survey are available here: </p><p>A new Survey on Income and Costs is currently being administered by Pobal alongside the 2020/2021 Annual Early Years Service Profile. This will provide up to date data on income and costs to services, and is also intended to inform the development of policy and funding schemes in the future as well as the Expert Group which is working to develop a new funding model for ELC and SAC.</p></reply>

A key feature of the Action Plan is that, through extending registration and regulation to childminders, it will enable childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme and also to avail of a range of funding and other supports. Importantly, the National Action Plan commits to developing childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home and family setting in which childminders work.</p>  <p>  In terms of the involvement of childminders in decision-making on issues that affect them, the National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders on the Steering Group, which will be chaired by my Department. Additionally the National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders on all four Advisory Groups.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan itself was based on extensive consultation and engagement with childminders, and the blueprint for the National Action Plan was the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which was coordinated and chaired by Childminding Ireland. The National Action Plan commits to further consultation with childminders, especially during Phase 1 of the Plan when developing regulations specific to childminders. </p></reply>

In 2019/20 private services accounted for 74% (3,476) of all services contracted to provide at least one of the funding programmes, with community programmes accounting for the remaining 26% (1,214). Over recent years, there has been a slight increase in the number of private services while the number of community services has remained relatively constant, as demonstrated in Table 1 below. A breakdown of service provision by Local Authority is also available. As demonstrated in Table 2 below, Dublin had the highest number of community services at 158, followed by Cork County at 94 and Galway at 82. Kildare had the lowest number of community services, with 11 services recorded. Officials in my Department, in partnership with Pobal and the City and County Childcare Committees continue to monitor supply and demand for ELC and SAC closely in order to inform policy development in this area.</p><p>A key policy objective of my Department is to improve affordability, accessibility and quality of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised ELC and SAC.</p><p>In previous years the creation of new places and new services were prioritised in the Department's capital programmes. Many community facilities, and some private facilities, were built using public investment through the major capital investment programmes, Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (2000-2006) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (2006-2011).  Since then, annual capital programmes have provided investment for establishment of new provision, expansion of services, quality improvements and maintenance and upgrades to existing facilities in both the private and community sector. My Department&rsquo;s capital programmes have increased capacity in the sector by 27,433 places nationally since 2015.</p><p>In addition, First 5, the ten-year strategy for babies, young children and their families commits to maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised early learning and childcare to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families. To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040, and the development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC. </p><p>An Expert Group has been convened to examine the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group will recommend how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted to me in November.</p><p><b>Table 1: Community/Private Settings Breakdown</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Community </th>       <th>Private </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016/17 </td>       <td>3262 </td>       <td>1186 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017/18 </td>       <td>3342 </td>       <td>1201 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018/19 </td>       <td>3397 </td>       <td>1201 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019/20 </td>       <td>3476 </td>       <td>1214 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2: Breakdown by Local Authority</b></p></reply>

Student grant legislation was amended in 2020 to retain the status quo to allow maintenance grant funding for eligible students attending an approved undergraduate course in Northern Ireland/the UK to continue post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  In general, an approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State or the UK.  </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme does not extend to the payment of tuition fees to institutions outside the State, other than for exceptional provision in respect of postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland. This provision is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding between both jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. The extension of funding under the Student Grant Scheme to provide for both fees and maintenance grant assistance for undergraduate students in Northern Ireland is not part of the current review.  </p>  <p>  However, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.    </p>  <p>  A comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options contained in the Cassells Review was commissioned by the European Commission and undertaken by independent expert consultants.  This review is currently being finalised.  </p>  <p>  This analysis highlights the high level of fees support amounting to in excess of &euro;500m per annum provided by the State for large numbers of students participating in higher education.  This comprises of funding for tuition fees of almost 140,000 eligible undergraduate higher education students with over 60,000 students having all or part of the &euro;3,000 student contribution paid on their behalf under the Student Grant Scheme.  </p>  <p>  This substantial funding support has played a very important role in enabling access to and growth in higher education in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, higher education which was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current high transfer rate from second to third level in comparison with other EU countries. </p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.  I look forward to the completion of the funding review which will provide the basis for determining how best additional investment in higher education can meet future requirements, in particular in supporting access to higher education in terms of the totality of the costs of participation.  This is an essential to meeting a core objective of my mission as Minister is that everyone regardless of their background, age, gender, or address achieves their best potential.  </p></reply>

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  A core principle which underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families, to ensure a fair use of the financial resources available.  This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.  </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial difficulty can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  A core principle which underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families, to ensure a fair use of the financial resources available.  This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.  </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial difficulty can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The completed review recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the so-called RFAM report is the development of a costing model applied consistently across HEIs. At present, there is some differentiation in the costing approach as between the Universities and Technological Universities and Institutes of Technology. The review recommends moving away from the current &lsquo;two-pot&rsquo; funding approach with fixed proportionate allocations to universities/specialist colleges and institutes of technology and towards a universal approach to supporting all HEIs. </p>  <p>  This will involve the standard student-driven methodology determining base allocations, and a broadly universal set of metrics for research and innovation support, with individual adjustments and targeted funds ensuring that sufficient incentives remain to protect and to reinforce the diversity of different individual missions. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 7 of the RFAM report identifies that the design of this new costing model will be informed by a short, focused review to establish a single, shared costing approach to be implemented across all higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  Subsequently Deloitte was appointed by the HEA in 2019 to undertake a scoping exercise on an appropriate model.  In 2021, the HEA working with the Department, Department of Expenditure and Reform, Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association will commence development of a conceptual framework on the journey towards adoption of a Universal Costing System applying across the entire higher education sector.</p></reply>

This means that we have exceeded the Innovation 2020 targeted increase of 500 enrolments from the 2013/14 baseline (Action 3.5).</p>  <p>  It is imperative that we continue to develop a pipeline of research talent if Ireland is to realise its ambitions under the new Programme for Government and Project Ireland 2040 and my officials will be exploring this as part of the development of the next National Research and Innovation Strategy currently underway at my department.</p></reply>

The scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI was undertaken by the then Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation working with the Department of Education and Skills, prior to the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p><p>The Programme for Government recognises the high-quality research emerging through national funding agencies and programmes, such as SFI, IRC, HRB and PRTLI, and commits to continuing to support engagement in research that addresses societal challenges and advances the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Pending a new cycle of PRTLI, it is important to note that actions are being taken to address the key elements that had been encompassed by PRTLI including infrastructure, equipment and structured PhD programmes.</p><p>- My Department is committed to a significant capital investment over the coming years in higher education infrastructure. </p><p>- SFI funds six Centres for Research Training (CRTs) that are collectively hosted across a partner network of ten research bodies. The CRTs aim to promote excellence in research and education by training 719 CRT doctoral students in data and ICT skills; equipping them with transversal, cross-sectoral and discipline specific skills. The CRTs deliver a student-focused postgraduate research and training experience, where students are empowered, with appropriate guidance, to define their individual research and training programme. To date, 321 students (143 in 2019 and 178 in 2020) have been recruited across the 6 CRTs. </p><p>- The SFI Research Infrastructure Programme supports the research community in building and sustaining the required infrastructural capacity to accomplish high-quality, high-impact and innovative research in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics that demonstrably enhance and support enterprise competitiveness and societal development in Ireland. The programme seeks applications for strategic research infrastructures that focus on large-scale items in areas of national priority and other areas of strategic opportunity. Just under &euro;50m was invested under the last call which opened in 2018 but for which a reserve list remained open for two years. Those investments provided critical, state of the art infrastructure within Higher Education Institutes across a broad range of areas of strategic and societal importance.</p><p>- SFI has recently opened a new SFI Research Infrastructure Programme call with applications being accepted until 2nd July 2021. </p><p>Future cycles of PRTLI were referenced in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, which is currently under review. My Department has recently launched a public consultation to inform the next National Research and Innovation Strategy. Through this, we are seeking submissions on a wide array of issues, including enhancing the talent pipeline at the heart of our research, development and innovation system and building a strong research and innovation environment grounded in excellence. These issues and how to continue to address them will play a significant role in the next national R&amp;amp;I strategy.</p></reply>

The table shows that the number of students studying courses in Law and Legal Studies in Further Education and Training (FET) has been increasing since 2018.  The detailed breakdown of courses and enrolments are only accessible since the rollout of the SOLAS PLSS recording system so comparable 2016 and 2017 data is not available. Please note that these courses are not specifically or exclusively &lsquo;pre-law&rsquo; courses but they would prepare those students who want to progress onto third level education in law studies.  </p><p>SOLAS, the further education authority have informed me that they do not hold any statistical information on the number of students' progression onto third level degree courses in law. However, I can confirm that at a broader level, there are strong pathways from the Further Education to the Higher Education sector in particular for PLC provision that includes law and legal study in FET. </p><p>The FET courses in &lsquo;Law&rsquo; falls under the learning field of Business Administration and Law. In the PLC outcomes report, SOLAS found that the majority of learners who completed a course in a given International Standard Classification of Education field of learning progressed onto third level education in the same field. For example, 57 % of Business Administration and Law PLC graduates moved onto third level education in the same field (504 graduates out of 885).  <table>    <tr>       <th>Programme Description</th>       <th>Sum of Enrolments</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>786</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Law &amp;amp; Politics</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Administration</td>       <td>147</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Administration</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Secretarial Studies</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Secretary</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Studies</td>       <td>127</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Law</td>       <td>282</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>811</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Administration</td>       <td>136</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Administration</td>       <td>159</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Studies</td>       <td>102</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Business Law</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Law</td>       <td>359</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Security, Criminology &amp;amp; Legal Studies</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Administration</td>       <td>151</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Administration</td>       <td>104</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Secretarial Studies</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Studies</td>       <td>112</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Business Law</td>       <td>41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Law</td>       <td>393</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Security, Criminology &amp;amp; Legal Studies</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>501</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Administration</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal and Medical Administration</td>       <td>86</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Studies</td>       <td>112</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Business Law</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-University Law</td>       <td>179</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Security, Criminology &amp;amp; Legal Studies</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>2978</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In compliance with the Act, any balance standing to the credit of the current account of the National Training Fund (NTF) which is not required to meet current expenditure is transferred to the investment account. Following a decision by the European Central Bank in September 2014, the interest rate applied on the NTF investment account was negative, resulting in an interest charge to the NTF. As a result of the negative interest rate, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance examined  alternative investment vehicles for the investment account and since 2015, NTF funds held in the Investment Account have been invested in 0% National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) Exchequer Notes. As at end May 2021, &euro;918 million of NTF funds are invested with the NTMA. My Department is cognisant of the need to achieve a balance between having funds available at reasonably short notice to meet obligations under the Fund with the requirement to achieve a favourable yield.  Although longer term investments may have a higher return at the outset, this may lead to a capital loss in the event of a disposal. While there is no income earned on these Exchequer Notes, the capital amount invested is guaranteed. The Department engages regularly with the Department of Finance and the NTMA to ensure that the investment strategy represents value for money and strikes an appropriate balance between accessibility, yield and risk.</p></reply>

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  A core principle which underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families, to ensure a fair use of the financial resources available.  This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.   </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  My Department has liaised closely on an ongoing basis with the Department of Social Protection since the introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it impacts on the student grant scheme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments approval was given to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. The review is being conducted by external consultants. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial difficulty can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Off-the-job training is delivered in phases 2, 4 and 6 of a craft apprenticeship in ETB Training Centres (Phase 2), Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities (Phases 4 and 6). </p>  <p>  A rapid growth in craft apprentice registrations over the past 4 years, combined with COVID-19 related suspension of face to face off-the-job training during 2020 and 2021 has had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to access off-the-job training in a timely manner. This has impacted on waiting lists for off-the-job training for electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery and motor mechanic apprentices in particular. </p>  <p>  A number of emergency measures have been put in place to ensure that craft apprentices are facilitated in progressing in their programmes insofar as possible. Those apprentices who had been assigned to off-the-job training in January 2021 prior to the second lockdown were facilitated to complete theory elements of off-the-job training remotely during January and February. This group was prioritised for the phased return to off-the-job practical training and assessment during April and have now completed their phases. </p>  <p>  &euro;20M in capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period in addition to &euro;12M already allocated to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures. Spaces arising from these measures will begin to come on-stream in the second half of this year. </p>  <p>  All institutions with learners (including apprentices) onsite are operating on the basis of current public health guidance with face to face training operating at approximately 50% normal capacity. As the public health situation improves, increased capacity will become available within both the existing and new physical facilities.</p>  <p>  SOLAS and the HEA are actively working with the education and training providers to identify additional solutions which will address the waiting lists for off-the-job elements of craft apprenticeship to ensure that apprentices are enabled to complete their training as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The impact of the pandemic has been far reaching and has impacted on many jobs and careers, including apprenticeships within the construction industry. Any apprentice that has been made redundant as a result of the pandemic can apply for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  It is also possible for an apprentice to complete their apprenticeship with another SOLAS approved employer. They should engage with the Authorised Officer in their local Educational and Training Board, as they are best placed to give advice on how to source an alternate employer and to ensure a successful outcome.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions via the recurrent funding model.</p>  <p>  The recurrent funding of technological universities sits within the context of the review of the HEA funding model. In 2016, the HEA appointed an independent Expert Panel to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future. The completed review recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the RFAM report is the development of a Costing Model applied consistently across Higher Education Institutes (at present, there is some differentiation in the costing approach as between the Universities and the Technological Universities; Institutes of Technology).  The review recommends moving away from the current &lsquo;two-pot&rsquo; funding approach (with fixed proportionate allocations to universities/specialist colleges and institutes of technology) and towards a universal approach to supporting all higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  This will involve the standard student-driven methodology determining base allocations, and a broadly universal set of metrics for research and innovation support, with individual adjustments and targeted funds ensuring that sufficient incentives remain to protect and to reinforce the diversity of different individual missions. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 7 of the report identifies that the design of this new model will be informed by a short, focused review to establish a single, shared costing approach to be implemented across all higher education institutions. Deloitte were appointed by HEA in 2019 to undertake a scoping exercise on an appropriate model.  </p>  <p>  In 2021, the HEA working with my Department, DPER and sector representatives will commence development of a conceptual framework on the journey towards adoption of a Universal Costing System applying across the entire Higher Education Sector.</p></reply>

The system for reporting on higher education expenditure on research and innovation follows the guidelines set out in the OECD&rsquo;s Frascati Manual.</p><p>The size of the R&amp;amp;I component of the recurrent grant is based on the proportion of time spent on research at the institution by the permanent academic staff, and applying that proportion to the overall funding of departmental R&amp;amp;I activities. </p><p>Expenditure on R&amp;amp;I is measured by way of the HERD Survey (Higher Education Research &amp;amp; Development).

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  A core principle which underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families, to ensure a fair use of the financial resources available.  This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.   </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  My Department has liaised closely on an ongoing basis with the Department of Social Protection since the introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it impacts on the student grant scheme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments approval was given to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. The review is being conducted by external consultants. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial difficulty can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The matters raised are an internal matter for the University of Limerick (UL) and my Department is therefore not in a position to intervene in the related policies of the University.</p>  <p>  This matter was raised in the Dail with me and I sought further clarity from University of Limerick. It advised that &ldquo;Changes in university teaching delivery has had a significant impact on the costs and benefits of higher and adult education. First, it changes the nature of a university&rsquo;s costs, reducing operational expenditure on utilities and services, but increasing the cost of IT services, staff training in new technologies and the provision of additional counselling and support services for students. </p>  <p>  On balance, the costs of higher education are higher in a blended model, and this has been reflected in additional government grants to universities. The budgeting process and Masters programme pricing is completed by the Postgraduate Studies office in consultation with the faculty Deans. The eventual price of the Masters programme depends on a range of factors including the cost of delivery and the support structures including everything from administrative support to estate maintenance. The total fee after scholarships is approximately split 50/50 with central administration and the faculty. As an aside, scholarships for all programmes increased this year as a tacit acknowledgement of the impact of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Within the Kemmy Business School, the fees received do not have a list of sub accounts where the monies are allocated to various costs. The cost of the virtual workshop this year was significant and the time and effort put into the delivery of that workshop was equivalent or greater to the organisational effort for an international trip. </p>  <p>  For the KBS, the key task was to ensure that students achieved the learning outcomes as per our mandate from Higher Education Authority (HEA) and audited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). We are confident that these outcomes were achieved. The cost of delivery between the international trip and virtual workshop or other alternatives cannot be distinguished.</p>  <p>  While it is true to say that some operational costs such as heat, light, etc. have decreased other costs have increased. These increased costs include considerable human and technological resources into pivoting to online delivery at very short notice. These costs are spread across the campus and it is not possible to allocate them to particular programmes.</p>  <p>  Overall, responding to the pandemic has changed the way that we provide education, but it does not mean that either the cost of provision or the value of the student learning is diminished. Despite the very real challenges, we have continued to adapt our education delivery in order to teach, assess and graduate students with the same high qualifications and skills&rdquo;.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions via the recurrent funding model.</p>  <p>  The costs associated with any blended delivery methods of higher education programmes and the appropriate allocations of funding would be considered within the context of the review of the HEA allocation models for Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) across the entire higher education sector.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the HEA appointed an independent Expert Panel to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future. The completed review recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the RFAM report is the development of a Costing Model applied consistently across Higher Education Institutes (at present, there is some differentiation in the costing approach as between the Universities and the Technological Universities; Institutes of Technology).  The review recommends moving away from the current &lsquo;two-pot&rsquo; funding approach (with fixed proportionate allocations to universities/specialist colleges and institutes of technology) and towards a universal approach to supporting all higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  This will involve the standard student-driven methodology determining base allocations, and a broadly universal set of metrics for research and innovation support, with individual adjustments and targeted funds ensuring that sufficient incentives remain to protect and to reinforce the diversity of different individual missions. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 7 of the report identifies that the design of this new model will be informed by a short, focused review to establish a single, shared costing approach to be implemented across all higher education institutions. Deloitte were appointed by HEA in 2019 to undertake a scoping exercise on an appropriate model.  </p>  <p>  In 2021, the HEA working with my Department, DPER and sector representatives will commence development of a conceptual framework on the journey towards adoption of a Universal Costing System applying across the entire Higher Education Sector.</p></reply>

For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  A core principle which underpins the SUSI means assessment process is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families, to ensure a fair use of the financial resources available.  This includes the treatment of similar social protection payments for students and families.   </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  My Department has liaised closely on an ongoing basis with the Department of Social Protection since the introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it impacts on the student grant scheme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments approval was given to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. The review is being conducted by external consultants. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial difficulty can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Off-the-job training is delivered in phases 2, 4 and 6 of a craft apprenticeship in ETB Training Centres (Phase 2), Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities (Phases 4 and 6). </p>  <p>  A rapid growth in craft apprentice registrations over the past 4 years, combined with COVID-19 related suspension of face to face off-the-job training during 2020 and 2021 has had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to access off-the-job training in a timely manner.  This has impacted on waiting lists for off-the-job training for electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery and motor mechanic apprentices in particular. </p>  <p>  A number of emergency measures have been put in place to ensure that craft apprentices are facilitated in progressing in their programmes insofar as possible. Those apprentices who had been assigned to off-the-job training in January 2021 prior to the second lockdown were facilitated to complete theory elements of off-the-job training remotely during January and February.  This group was prioritised for the phased return to off-the-job practical training and assessment during April and have now completed their phases. </p>  <p>  &euro;20M in capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period in addition to &euro;12M already allocated to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures. Spaces arising from these measures will begin to come on-stream in the second half of this year. </p>  <p>  All institutions with learners (including apprentices) on site are operating on the basis of current public health guidance with face to face training operating at approximately 50% normal capacity.  As the public health situation improves, increased capacity will become available within both the existing and new physical facilities.</p>  <p>  SOLAS and the HEA are actively working with the education and training providers to identify additional solutions which will address the waiting lists for off-the-job elements of craft apprenticeship to ensure that apprentices are enabled to complete their training as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed in chronological order in the interests of fairness to applicants and are assessed individually in accordance with the legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment or the nationality of the applicant. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are just over 24,600 applications on hand at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  The identity of every applicant must be confirmed to the greatest extent possible and a passport is a primary identifier. Therefore, it is a requirement of the naturalisation process that a current passport must accompany every application. Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office due to COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in delays in the return of some passports. </p>  <p>  Applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons and the citizenship website advises that in these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk at: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie, with the relevant details. Any request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material detailing the reasons for travel, such as medical information. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly. </p>  <p>  The pandemic has meant that citizenship ceremonies, the final stage of the process, cannot be held at this time. However, a temporary system that enables citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty to the State was opened in January 2021. </p>  <p>  Approximately 2,894 people have received their Irish citizenship since then.  A further 1,853 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and will receive their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.  By the end of this month, the Citizenship Division of my Department will have communicated with 6,500 applicants, offering them the opportunity to complete their citizenship journey through the statutory declaration process. Healthcare and other frontline workers are benefitting from these new arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Officials from the Citizenship Division of my Department have also met with doctors&rsquo; representatives in recent months, including Train us for Ireland, and that positive engagement will continue.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided the following update on this matter. </p>  <p>  Covid-19 has affected the way court lists are managed. Prior to the pandemic, I am informed that a Judge would have a callover of cases at the start of the court list to prioritise the running order of the court. Court users would then wait in the courthouse for their case to be called. Social distancing requirements have changed this way of working. I understand that court lists are now normally staggered with specific times slots assigned to cases. The new arrangements allow the courts to deal with as many cases as possible while ensuring public health guidelines are enforced. </p>  <p>  However, court cases do not always run on schedule as some cases can run longer or finish quicker than anticipated. While this may cause some inconvenience to court users, it remains the safest option to manage court proceedings during the pandemic and ensure that people can have their cases heard.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Ennis court lists operate on this model and generally court lists have been managed safely and successfully by implementing the new procedures. However, I understand from the Courts Service that the office recently had an issue at a court sitting where a court list was not staggered and this regrettably did lead to inconvenience for some court users. Extra space was opened up to accommodate as many people in the courthouse as could safely be accommodated and arrangements were made with some court users having to leave and return later in the day. I am advised that office management has subsequently ensured that staff understand the importance of staggering court lists and it is expected that this incident should not reoccur.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service further informs me that it cannot establish a text alert system for court users as the Courts Service does not gather or receive mobile phone details of court users in the normal course of business. As such, the Courts Service's ICT systems cannot facilitate a text alert system. The Courts Service has also identified data protection issues, which may also arise if this suggestion was implemented. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service are satisfied that the measures that they have in place will ensure that this type of incident should not reoccur.</p></reply>

This followed on from the work of a sub-group of the Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour, which I chair, to consider community-based approaches to address the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes as part of the overall package of Government measures to tackle the issue.</p>  <p>  This initiative is centred around Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) who are being invited to lead on the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.  GYDPs will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority.  It is envisaged that the local authority partner will in general be responsible for provision of tracks and related facilities.</p>  <p>  In May, my Department invited the GYDPs to present proposals for the scheme to offer positive alternatives to young people engaged in anti-social use of scramblers, including specific contact with GYDPs in areas that are most affected by this issue.</p>  <p>  I should stress that this initiative is focussed on young people at risk of crime and anti-social behaviour and specifically anti-social use of these vehicles.  It is not intended to duplicate the responsibilities of mainstream youth services or to fund motocross or similar sports as such.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, while at the same time creating alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, members of the public who are concerned about any individual misuse of scramblers should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients and users of their services. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance, pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund, and keep records of all offers received in respect of land which is offered for sale.    </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Compensation Fund is to provide compensation to clients of licensees who have sustained a loss as a result of the dishonesty of a licensee as well as individuals to whom a refund of a deposit is due from the licensee. </p>  <p>  Professional indemnity insurance provides cover in respect of any description of civil liability on the part of a licensee arising from any provision of property services.  </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers (including complaints made by purchasers or potential purchasers of property), and to carry out investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Improper conduct is defined in the Act as the commission by a licensee of an act which renders him or her no longer a fit and proper person to provide property services, the commission of a contravention of a specified provision of the Act or of a provision of regulations made under the Act, or by the licensee giving a statement of advised market value or advised letting value of land (including buildings) which is clearly unreasonable. </p>  <p>  It is open to a purchaser or potential purchaser of property to engage any professional assistance that he or she considers necessary. </p>  <p>  While my Department keeps the operation of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 under review, I have no plans at present to amend the Act in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda Vetting at present. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-Vetting system is 3 to 5 working days for over 85% of vetting applications received. As of 4 June 2021, the processing time is 5 working days. </p>  <p>  I am informed that occasionally it is necessary for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct enquiries with external Garda stations and agencies such as the Courts Service, Probation Service, Child and Family Agency, etc. in relation to processing vetting applications. These enquiries are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons such as verification of identity; updating of incomplete records and establishing outcomes of investigations. I am advised that in such instances, processing times are significantly longer than the average. </p>  <p>  Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the eVetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by all applicants when completing their application online. Further details on this facility are also outlined on the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na website, vetting.garda.ie.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise to the Deputy that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016. I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the importance of this task and the need for it to be carried out thoroughly and correctly.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Minister McEntee recently announced the establishment of an inter-departmental group to undertake a review of Garda vetting arrangements and legislation. The group will examine the consideration of a range of issues and will make recommendations for amending legislation and strengthening the Garda vetting process.</p>  <p>  The group will also review the approach to the connected issue of vetting for specific employments. This will include consideration of moving to a system in which a person is vetted for the work they will be, or are likely to be, engaged in in that employment within categories of identified risk and taking into account likely additional responsibilities within the same employment role. This will avoid the need for additional vetting during the same 36 month period if individuals are largely carrying out the same role. Redeployment on promotion or to a substantially different job would continue to require re-vetting.</p>  <p>  In both employment and volunteering situations, provision would also be made for vetting certificates to be withdrawn before the expiry of the 36 months if deemed necessary, i.e. in situations where new information comes to light that points to a substantive and immediate risk to children or vulnerable adults.</p>  <p>  The group comprises representatives of the Department of Justice, Department of Health, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and the Public Appointments Service. As part of the work of the group, a public consultation process will be undertaken.</p></reply>

To support that position, my Department is not currently accepting any short stay visa applications, except for cases that fall under the Emergency/Priority criteria set out below.

It is a priority for me as Minister to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p>  <p>  Following approval by Government, my Department recently published the General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill.  The Bill will enable the Department to address the important data controller concerns raised by the Data Protection Commissioner, among other matters, providing for a requirement to review authorisations after a set time period and a requirement for joint data control agreements to be in place. The Bill will also provide a comprehensive statutory underpinning for the use of digital recording equipment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner.  When enacted, this legislation will replace section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021.</p>  <p>  Last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  Grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements. In other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant local authority (also acting as data controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from the Department of Justice website - www.justice.ie - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address, fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

The Scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet.  </p><p>The Scheme was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the Scheme.</p><p>The Scheme commenced in February 2016 and was initially only open to Non-EEA crew members who were already working in the Fishing Industry in Ireland.  From July of that year, all non-EEA workers intending to work in the fishing industry were required to obtain an Atypical Worker Permission (Stamp 1 conditions) from my Department and a Visa clearance, if applicable, prior to entering the State. </p><p>The Scheme for SeaFishers also provides for the annual renewal of the permission granted and permits the employee to transfer employment within the sector. However, the permission granted is not transferrable to any other employment sector within the State. </p><p>The table below sets out the information requested by the Deputy.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Numbers</th>       <th>-</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The number of non-EEA migrant fishers that are currently enrolled in the atypical work permit scheme</td>       <td>There are 227 valid permissions granted under the Scheme at present.

These automatic extension of permissions may have impacted on the number of renewal applications made in the last 12 months.</p><p>The 2015 Report of the cross Departmental Task Force states that a maximum of 500 permissions can be active at any one time. This cap has never been reached since the Scheme commenced.</p><p>The scheme is monitored by an Oversight Committee chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I understand that the current interest in catalytic converter theft may be directly associated with the current high price of palladium available on the market.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for offences of theft, the handling of stolen property and the possession of stolen property. The offence of theft provided for by this legislation, based on the broad nature of the offence, includes the theft of scrap metal and catalytic converters.

It creates two new offences of sending, or threatening to send, intimate images without the consent of the person whose image it is. </p><p>The first offence deals with the taking, distribution, publication or threat to distribute intimate images without consent, and with intent to cause harm to the victim and carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or seven years&rsquo; imprisonment. </p><p>The second offence deals with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim and carries a maximum penalty of a &euro;5,000 fine and/or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p><p>The penalties are high to reflect the level of harm caused to the victim and the legislation rightly provides that it will be irrelevant that a person may have consented to the taking of an image if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent. </p><p>The Act also updates the existing harassment legislation by broadening the scope of the offence of harassment to cover all forms of persistent communications about a person and has increased the penalty from seven to 10 years to reflect the harm that can be caused by the most serious forms of harassment.</p><p>The new legislation is intentionally silent about the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences so as to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim.</p><p>Under D&aacute;il standing orders, a post-enactment report reviewing the functioning of the new legislation will be carried out after one year. A Committee Stage amendment was also accepted in the D&aacute;il which requires a review to be carried out within three years of the passing of the legislation (Section 12 of the 2020 Act). </p><p>When signing the commencement order for &ldquo;Coco&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; it was announced that an agreement had been reached between my Department, the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at DCU, and the Department of Education to establish a &lsquo;Research Observatory on Cyberbullying&rsquo; focused on providing up-to-date research, advice and resources related to cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment, and the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s Law. Funding for the Observatory is being provided by the Department of Justice in memory of Nicole (Coco) Fox.</p><p>Funding was also announced for Webwise to update their popular &lsquo;Lockers&rsquo; programme, which is an important Junior Cycle resource to include information about Coco&rsquo;s Law and non-consensual sharing of intimate images. </p><p>My Department is currently developing a wider awareness campaign on Coco&rsquo;s Law and the penalties applicable if someone is convicted of sharing intimate images without consent, and to draw attention to the harm caused to the victim whose intimate image is shared. We intend to communicate our message in a way that will build on our existing &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; campaign and its key message of not excusing any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence.</p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that in addition to Coco's Law, separate legislation to include provision for an online safety commissioner has been proposed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, which published the General Scheme of the Online Safety Media Regulation Bill earlier this year.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill contains provisions empowering the proposed Online Safety Commissioner to make online safety codes; assess the compliance of online services with those safety codes; direct online services to make changes to their systems, processes and policies and design and seek to apply financial sanctions to services who fail to comply.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that Justice Plan 2021 commits to introducing new legislation to deal with hate crime and incitement to hatred, by the end of this year. This commitment gives effect to the Programme for Government commitment to introduce legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act.</p><p>Furthermore, the Government recently approved the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021.</p><p>The General Scheme was drafted following the publication of the results of a widespread consultation process, which included in-depth consultations with various civil society and community groups, academics and experts and a detailed comparative study of approaches to hate crime in 5 other jurisdictions. The report on that consultation is available at: </p><p>Although incitement to hatred is already an offence, experience has shown that it is difficult to prosecute and there have been very few convictions since the introduction of the 1989 Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred .</p><p>The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. It also proposes new offences of incitement to hatred, which are clearer and simpler than those in the 1989 Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act. These offences cover inciting hatred against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected characteristic, and also disseminating or distributing material inciting hatred.</p></reply>

This General Scheme was developed on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) following its fundamental in-depth review in 2017-2018. </p>  <p>  A central tenet of the CoFPI report is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be seen and treated as a single organisation with a single workforce. To support this CoFPI recommended that non-sworn members (i.e. Garda staff) should be recruited directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not to the general civil service, and should be treated as valued members of a single Garda workforce with a shared mission. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme gives effect to this recommendation by providing for the Garda Commissioner to recruit and appoint Garda staff in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. Under the Scheme, the Minister may also designate by order that existing civil servants within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will change status, but only after engagement with trade unions and staff associations. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that no changes to the status of existing Garda staff will take place solely as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation. An order of the Minister will be required before any designation changing the civil servant status of existing Garda staff may be made. The Minister must engage with any trade union or staff association concerned and consider any representations made by them.

The Programme for Government commits to continuing to fund Abhaile, and to introducing the necessary reforms to our personal insolvency legislation to ensure that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties. This also reflects the Government&rsquo;s ongoing prioritisation of more vulnerable citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the period of national recovery which will follow.</p><p>An important component of Abhaile relates to the provision of legal aid for proceedings under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended). This legislation provides for a process where a proposal for personal insolvency arrangement can be implemented by a court even if rejected by creditors at a creditors meeting. </p><p>The legal aid available includes the services of a solicitor from the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Abhaile Solicitors Panel and payment to the personal insolvency practitioner with respect to the expenses they incur in making the section 115A application. Prior to 1 March 2019 the services of Junior Counsel were funded in all section 115A applications. Since that date the services of Counsel may be sought on a case by case basis as is the case in other civil legal aid matters.</p><p>These panels and supports are administered independently by the Legal Aid Board under the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions. They are also subject to statutory audit and certification by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and subject to the relevant internal audit and corporate governance procedures. The following information has been provided in the form of three Schedules by the Legal Aid Board.</p><p><b>Schedule A </b>sets out the amounts spent by the Legal Aid Board on solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to 31 May 2021.</p><p><b>Schedule B </b>sets out the amount paid to by the Legal Aid Board to each individual solicitor, barrister and personal insolvency practitioner for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to 31 May 2021.</p><p><b>Schedule C </b>sets out the total amounts incurred but not yet paid by the Legal Aid Board in connection with solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 as at 11 June 2021. </p><p>I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board and am informed that the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide information as to individual amounts accrued into the future for individual service providers. This is because the legal aid recipients concerned engage their own solicitor from the panel on foot of a legal aid certificate and it is for that solicitor (if authorised to do so) to instruct counsel. The Legal Aid Board does not therefore become aware of which solicitor and barrister has been so engaged until the relevant claim is later submitted to it for that purpose.</p></reply>

Of those 68 recommendations, 59 have been decided upon and the prisoners have been informed of the Minister&rsquo;s decision. The remaining 9 recommendations (5 of these were received on 7 May 2021 and 4 were received on 26 May 2021) are currently being processed. </p>  <p>  When making recommendations to the Minister for Justice, the Board advises the Minister of the prisoner's progress in their rehabilitation to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic and other services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence.</p>  <p>  The final decision regarding the recommendations of the Parole Board lies with the Minister for Justice. This function is currently delegated to me. I may accept these recommendations in their entirety, in part or reject them. In doing so, a range of factors are taken into consideration before a final determination is made on the recommendations received. These include: </p>  <p>  - The nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served relates;</p>  <p>  - The sentence of imprisonment and the period of the sentence served by the prisoner;</p>  <p>  - The conduct of the person in custody; </p>  <p>  - The recommendations of the various services involved in the management of the prisoner's sentence and the Parole Board, and</p>  <p>  - Recommendations and reports made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the number of cases where recommendations were accepted, rejected or amended as to do so would require a review of each individual file which would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time, in particular at a time when resources are being focused on finalising recommendations received from the Interim Parole Board in advance of the establishment of the Parole Board on a statutory basis. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, to provide the Deputy with the reason(s) for any amendment or rejection of the Parole Board recommendations could lead to the identification of the prisoner concerned and/or the victim and their families. Each prisoner receives the Minister&rsquo;s decision in writing following their review by the Board and are advised of the factors (as outlined above) taken into consideration in making that decision.</p></reply>

Aside from the supports provided through Abhaile, normal legal aid rules apply in repossession cases.</p>  <p>  These supports for citizens are provided independently by the bodies concerned who continue to deliver their services in accordance with their respective statutory mandates with continued success. They have maintained provision of these services to the public, including through the innovative deployment of remote technologies, during the challenging pandemic period. Moreover, these cases have also continued to be dealt with by the Courts as part of the priority being given to vulnerable citizens under the Government&rsquo;s national COVID-19 response. </p>  <p>  A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) is an insolvency solution for people with unsecured and secured debts. PIAs are proposed by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) − a qualified professional advisor expert in the area of debt advice and regulated by the ISI to deal with Personal Insolvency Arrangements.</p>  <p>  The PIA Court review is available where the borrower has worked with a PIP and proposed a PIA to their creditors but the creditors have not approved the proposal, although the borrower&rsquo;s PIP considers it fair and reasonable to all concerned. Under section 115A of the Act, the PIP in this situation can ask the Courts, on behalf of the borrower, to review the PIA proposal. If the Court agrees that the proposal is overall fair and reasonable, using the criteria set out in section 115A, it has the power to impose the proposal on the creditors.</p>  <p>  As part of the PIA Court review process, the Legal Aid Board can provide the borrower with legal representation by a solicitor and barrister to make the Court review application, subject to the case meeting the criteria set out in the Civil Legal Aid Act. For this service, the borrower&rsquo;s PIP applies on their behalf to the Legal Aid Board. If the Legal Aid Board is satisfied with the application, it can then issue a Legal Aid Certificate for the borrower. The PIP chooses and instructs a solicitor on the Board's PIA Review Solicitors panel to act in the matter.</p>  <p>  Under the legal aid element of the Abhaile Scheme, any barrister on the Legal Aid Board's panel may act in a section 115A personal insolvency review case. I am advised that the practice is that the barrister is selected by the solicitor who has been appointed to represent the applicant. The Legal Aid Board also informs me that it has attempted to encourage additional practitioners to take up work relating to section 115A of the Act including holding a training event for members of the Bar to encourage them to take on civil legal aid work earlier this year. More generally, I understand that the Board always welcomes a spread of barristers undertaking legal aid work in any specific area of law or similarly in any specific geographic location. </p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board reports that it has granted 206 section 115A reviews in the period from 1 January 2021 to 28 May 2021. During January to December 2020, 562 borrowers were granted legal aid to apply for a personal insolvency review under section 115A of the Act. Since the launch of the Abhaile Scheme in mid-2016, almost 2,300 borrowers were provided with legal aid to take proceedings pursuant to section 115A.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently conducting an external governance review of Abhaile, which will be followed later this year by a comprehensive review of the Scheme as part of the previous government decision to extend Abhaile until the end of 2022.  A further commitment has been made under the Programme for Government to continue to resource Abhaile. It is the intention that these reviews will, in their respective findings, inform the delivery of Abhaile into the future, including as a key support for citizens during the period of COVID recovery.</p></reply>

The existing citizenship laws are based on lawful and reckonable residency of the parent or parents of the child and this will continue to be the case under the proposed amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, contained in the General scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021.</p><p>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 sets out the conditions for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation conferring Irish citizenship on a minor born in the State.  One of the conditions for naturalisation is that the applicant must have had one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and 4 years residence during the 8 years preceding that.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which was published last week, includes a proposed amendment to section 15 of the 1956 Act to reduce the residence requirement for naturalisation for minors born in the State from the current 4 year residence requirement to 2 years.  In effect, this will replace a 5 year residency requirement with a 3 year residency requirement with the requirement of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application continuing to apply.</p><p>I know that it has been a cause for concern for some that children born in Ireland to non-Irish parents do not have an automatic entitlement to citizenship. The Government fully respects the amendment of the Constitution approved by the Irish people in the 2004 referendum; however, we believe that providing a shorter pathway to citizenship is the right thing to do for these children. The Oireachtas will have the opportunity to debate the proposed changes to the legislation in the normal way. </p></reply>

Further communications will issue over the coming weeks and my Department is on track to meet the target of communicating with 6,500 people by the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions. Unfortunately, processing rates have been impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and we have been unable to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. In addition to the Covid-19 disruption, a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, also resulted in significant delays and the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time.</p>  <p>  Of the more than 24,000 applications currently on hand, there are 12,007 applicants waiting longer than 12 months for a decision on their application and the average time to an approval decision is currently 22 months.  This figure will improve as the backlog in applications is cleared, with the easing of Government restrictions allowing more staff to return to the office to process applications. </p>  <p>  To further address the volume of applications on hand, we are assigning additional staff to the citizenship team; and a number of measures have been introduced to increase the digitisation of the process. This includes the introduction of eTax clearance and eVetting; rolling out online payments; revising the Department's website to make it more user-friendly for customers; and launching the first immigration chatbot, Tara, which has answered more than 12,000 customer queries in a user-friendly way since last November. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up staff resources to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p></reply>

Prices for timber for forest owners has increased significantly in the last 12 to 18 months due to high demand for all forest products. This is an international issue and there are supply issues also being experienced in other European markets as timber is exported to others markets, including outside of the EU. Commodity prices have also risen across the board in a number of areas, including steel, concrete and plastics which together, with increased timber prices, is impacting on the cost of construction.</p>  <p>  Ireland's sawmill industry is highly competitive and supplies significant volumes of timber products for export to the UK. Over 80% of wood based panels manufactured in Ireland are exported to the UK and further afield. Ireland has always imported and exported timber and will continue to do so for the construction of houses.  </p>  <p>  Forestry, particularly the resolution of licensing issues, is a major priority for both myself and Minister of State Hackett who is responsible for the forestry sector. Under Project Woodland, the backlog and a review of licensing processes are being examined and recommendations are being made by the Working Groups in terms of improving the situation. We have committed to issuing 4,500 licences this year, a 75% increase on last year which I accept was a low year, and I fully expect to deliver on this promise. This year to date timber licensed is 59% higher than the same point last year. </p></reply>

When greening is added, the total value of this transfer is  approximately &euro;93m. </p><p>This process saw a minimum entitlement value reached in 2019 of 60% of the average. If full convergence were implemented in 2020 with no changes to the direct payments ceiling, i.e. to move from the minimum 60% to full flattening in that single year, approximately &euro;150m in total would have been redistributed (this figure includes entitlement value adjustment and greening). The requested county breakdown of this amount is not available at this time but is part of ongoing work.  It should be noted that this amount reflects the convergence process and direct payments structures which apply in the current CAP programme. </p><p>Note : Figures for the category &euro;50,001 - &euro;60,000 have also been included in the table below</p></reply>

The Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners share responsibility for verifying compliance with the legal requirements related to GI spirit drinks, including labelling.  </p><p>The Spirit Drinks Regulation requires that a GI spirit drink must be verified as compliant with the product specific Technical File, before it is placed on the market. These verification checks apply to any person or business who (a) is involved in any of the five Irish whiskey production processes (i.e. fermentation, distillation, maturation, blending, bottling and labelling/labelling only), or (b) who receives Irish whiskey in bulk or who markets or intends to market their product as Irish whiskey.  </p><p>Eligibility to use the registered Geographical Indication for the spirit drink 'Irish Whiskey' is governed by Regulation (EU) No. 2019/787 and the Irish Whiskey Technical File (IWTF).  The IWTF requires that the stages of production 'Brewing', 'Fermentation', 'Distillation' and 'Maturation' take place on the island of Ireland, while &lsquo;Blending&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bottling and Labelling&rsquo; may take place off the island. Such is the complexity of the Irish Whiskey supply chain, that some producers choose to carry out all production stages, while others opt to specialise in specific stages. Additionally, many Irish Whiskies are brought to the market by Brand Owners, who are not involved in any of the stages of production.</p><p>Since January of this year, the Department has assumed responsibility from the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the assessment and approval of labels for Irish Whiskey and Irish Poit&iacute;n.  When assessing Irish whiskey labels, the Department assesses 'provenance' under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, which states &quot;<i>1. Food information shall not be misleading, particularly: (a) as to the characteristics of the food and, in particular, as to its nature, identity, properties, composition, quantity, durability, country of origin or place of provenance, method of manufacture or production&quot;.</i></p><p>Where uncertainty arises regarding who or where the product is produced, the Department seeks clarifications from the FBO. Furthermore, where FBOs are not directly involved in any of the stages of production, the Department does not approve the label unless it states that the product has been 'produced for them', as opposed to 'produced by them'. Additionally, the Department does not permit references to Distilleries that do not exist.</p></reply>

We all agree that supporting young farmers and facilitating generational renewal is critical to ensure a bright future for the agri-food sector. The new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has cited generational renewal as one of the nine key objectives, which reflects the need to ensure a vibrant agricultural sector equipped with skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods.  </p>  <p>  Under the current CAP, the National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years when setting up a farm enterprise. Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40%.  </p>  <p>  While the CAP negotiations are still ongoing and the Department is actively engaging on these issues, there is no facility in the regulations to earmark funds generated from a definition of a genuine farmer for young farmers. As negotiations are at an advanced stage, the introduction of a new facility such as this is extremely unlikely. However, the Department would be happy to explore all options that arise. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are additional supports at national level, with strong taxation measures assisting land mobility and facilitating succession, access to finance measures and a range of educational, training and advisory services. Supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority and I will continue to actively engage on this issue.</p></reply>

As a result of this cessation in peat harvesting, industrial cutover peatlands are becoming increasingly available for other land use options, including opportunities for the restoration of native woodland habitats. </p><p>This availability of land occurs at a point in time where there is a greater demand than ever for new woodlands, to counteract existing biodiversity and climate challenges. Native woodlands are an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, history and culture, and are unique in terms of their biodiversity. They are home to specialised native woodland animals, birds, insects and plants. They provide numerous ecosystem services, including the protection and enhancement of water quality, wider habitat linkage, landscape enhancement, opportunities for outdoor recreation and interpretation, wider rural development linkages, and carbon capture. </p><p>Further to a request for support for exploration of possibilities for native woodland creation on former industrial cutaway peatlands by Bord na M&oacute;na, the Department has developed a Pilot Scheme that is intended to facilitate the establishment of new native woodlands on state owned former industrial cutover peatlands on a pilot basis. This Pilot Scheme will facilitate native woodland regeneration at landscape scale, aiming at minimum intervention, and is compatible with other forms of peatland restoration measures at this scale. </p><p>The overall purpose of the Pilot Scheme is to support biodiversity, help reduce carbon emissions and stabilise soils to minimise soil erosion. These objectives are therefore different to the objectives of the current Afforestation Scheme.  The Pilot Scheme aims at mimicking natural vegetation establishment processes in high, dry areas and on slopes that are not suitable for re-wetting. </p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na intends to complement their rehabilitation plans for end-of-life cutaway bogs by creating a mosaic of wetlands and sparse woodlands that enhances biodiversity value, stabilises the loose peatland soil and reduces carbon losses. No project like this has been undertaken before and the Pilot therefore includes the establishment of trials to explore the most effective silvicultural techniques.</p><p>The Pilot Scheme was developed in accordance with provisions of the Forestry Act 2014 and is compliant with national and EU legislation, operational and environmental guidelines.</p><p>Following the specific purpose of this Pilot Scheme, the Scheme is confined to State bodies who own former industrial cutaway peatlands.</p><p>Grant funding for native woodlands created under this Pilot Scheme is subject to the applicant obtaining a licence for afforestation from the Minister.  An Environmental Impact Assessment is to be carried out as part of the licensing process and is at the applicant's own expense. No licence under the Pilot Scheme has been approved to date.</p><p>Grants paid under this Pilot Scheme are not following the GPC system which is applied to projects funded under the Department&rsquo;s Afforestation Scheme, but are on the basis of vouched expenditure and up to a maximum rate per hectare of native woodland established. To be eligible for grant aid, each plot within a plantation must conform to as specifically defined Industrial Cutaway Woodland (ICW) category.  I continue to work closely with Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has responsibility for both the horticulture and forestry sectors.</p><p>In terms of the processing of licence applications for private landowners to plant land, the Department is focusing all efforts on addressing the current backlog in licences .  We have committed to issuing a total of  4,500 licences this year, which is a 75% increase on the number issued last year which I accept was a low year, and I am hopeful that we will deliver on this promise.</p></reply>

Decisions on Coillte applications are subject to the same assessment, public consultation and appeals process as decisions on private sector applications.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, the issuing of tree felling licences was relatively balanced with 52% of felling licences issuing to Coillte and 48% to private applicants (in volume terms). To date this year, the breakdown is 56% to Coillte and 44% to the private sector. In recent weeks, the number of private felling licences issued has increased with the largest number this year issued last week at 39 licences. I expect this output to continue.</p>  <p>  The Department has set a target of 4,500 forestry licences to issue this year which is a 75% increase on last year, which I accept was a low year, and is committed to meeting this target.

However, there are still a wide range of areas where more clarity is needed and, whilst we expected the next iteration of the BOM in May, this did not occur and we have no definitive date as to when it might be updated.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Department continues to engage regularly with DEFRA, including at senior official level, to press for decisions on outstanding issues, including pre-notification periods and details to be pre-notified, certification queries, requirements for products transiting the landbridge and Border Control Post (BCP) infrastructure, processes and procedures in British ports. </p>  <p>  The Department has had very good technical engagement with DEFRA before and in the period since 1st January to ensure coordination between officials conducting import checks on goods from Great Britain in Irish BCPs and officials in the UK responsible for communicating the EU import requirements to stakeholders and officials in the UK responsible for meeting the EU import requirements, including for example, in relation to export health certification.  This engagement continues and is now focussing on UK import requirements for products of animal origin for the benefit of Irish exporters.  </p></reply>

Import controls on Products of Animal Origin entering Great Britain will come into effect from 1st October 2021.  </p>  <p>  Meeting the UK regulatory requirements poses significant challenges for the Department in the provision of veterinary certification, as well as for businesses, which must adapt their processes in order to ensure that they meet these new requirements. The Deputy should be aware that it will not be a specific requirement for a veterinary inspector to be present at a food business to sign off on an export health certificate, except on a risk basis, to check the load or when an official seal is requested.</p>  <p>  The Department has invested significantly in ensuring that the necessary staffing resources, IT systems and businesses processes are in place to support industry. Preparations are ongoing to provide veterinary certification in a manner that will support the geographically dispersed, just-in-time nature of supply chains with Great Britain.  </p>  <p>  However, the Department will not be providing veterinary certification 24/6, and it is important that businesses understand this and structure their requirements accordingly. The Department has established a Supply Chain Working Group to understand the specific challenges that industry faces, with a view to seeing how processes can be streamlined, both by the Department and by businesses themselves, in order to meet the UK requirements. Officials are continuing to communicate with industry and this engagement will step up over the coming months, including sharing lessons learned from trials.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of import controls by the UK has the potential to disrupt trade and I encourage all businesses exporting goods to Great Britain to prepare now and to work collaboratively with the Department to mitigate this disruption as much as possible.  </p></reply>

Initially, as REAP is a pilot initiative, we were limited to 2,000 spaces. However, following extensive engagement with the European Commission, I was able to increase the participation numbers in the project. Now, almost 5,000 farmers will be supported to undertake environmental commitments to increase the environmental value of existing farm features. This figure is more than double the original participation figure envisioned.</p>  <p>  Letters have issued to those approved into REAP. Unsuccessful applicants will receive a letter in the coming days. In the case of the person named, the application submitted did not meet the minimum mark required for approval under the ranking and selection process. Details of the ranking and selection process are set out in the project terms and conditions. Any farmer who receives notification to state their application has been unsuccessful may request a review of this decision by writing to the REAP Section at the Department.

These premises will allow onsite use of high-speed broadband by the public and will support a range of digitally enabled services, not least remote work and study.</p><p>The project is a collaboration between my Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, 28 of the 31 local authorities and approximately 300 community groups, sports clubs, libraries and small local businesses.</p><p>BCPs are identified by the local authorities and are assessed by my officials to ensure they will serve the public need, and by officials at D/ECC to ensure they are viable from a technical and cost perspective.</p><p>As part of the contract with Vodafone, BCP&rsquo;s are provided with branded materials and a range of marketing supports. NBI also assist with this, as do the local authorities, D/ECC and my Department. These are intended to drive demand for BCP services.</p><p>Notwithstanding these supports, awareness raising of the location of BCPs and the services they offer are vital to their long-term success. Accordingly, I have made &euro;5,000 available to every local authority to hold a County Launch, advertising the excellent work they have done to date preparing for a return to work, albeit through remote and blended working arrangements.</p><p>In April of this year it was bought to my attention that a number of BCPs had made their premises available to individual workers such as teachers, to support them during the lockdowns. They did this at no cost to the workers and did it in a safe and compliant manner. I am aware that this has a cost implication for the sites, not least for electricity use and heating during the winter months.</p><p>Under the original agreement, my Department committed to paying 75% of the ongoing connection costs of the majority of BCPs. </p><p>In April of this year I directed my Department to assume 100% of the ongoing connectivity costs for the remainder of this year. I also announced an upgrade in equipment specifications for a number of BCPs, to allow for the use of wired devices to support remote workers.</p><p>Furthermore, under the Connected Hubs Fund, BCPs and other hubs may apply for between &euro;10,000 and &euro;75,000 as a single applicant towards the costs of improving facilities to add remote working capacity. The total budget for this scheme is &euro;5M. I also continue to support the employment of a Broadband Officer in each local authority at annual cost of &euro;42,000 per local authority.</p><p>Lastly, as a development measure my Department has identified a number of activities and projects that may be delivered at BCPs. These include eHealth, education and training, remote working, and arts and culture. A number of these projects will be rolled out over the coming months. In the longer-term, I am committed to supporting the BCPs as they identify their communities&rsquo; own priorities and have pledged &euro;1,000 vouchers for each BCP to procure courses, services and memberships of networks as they see fit.</p><p>With regard to the dates of launch of each BCP, a table is attached with the &lsquo;Live&rsquo; date of all 188 operational BCPs. It is not possible to give projected live dates for the remaining BCPs as these are subject to a number of variables, not least access to premises and the availability of resources. Further BCPs will go live over the coming weeks and it is expected all BCPs will be fully functioning this year.</p></reply>

The competition has been in existence since 1958 and continues to grow in popularity, with a record 924 entries received in 2019. TidyTowns Groups operate on a voluntary basis and the continued success of the competition is testament to the time and effort which volunteers, young and old, put in to the competition right across the country. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the contribution which the TidyTowns Groups make to their local communities, grant funding of &euro;1.4 million was made available by my Department to TidyTowns Committees in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. This funding has allowed the Groups to better prepare for the annual competition through the purchase of small equipment and other materials.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the 2020 competition did not proceed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, last December I announced funding of &euro;1 million to help TidyTowns groups to prepare for this year's competition. This provided up to &euro;1,000 for every eligible TidyTowns group in the country, and is being provided as a top-up to the funding allocated to these groups at the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  If a Group participated in the competition in any of the years  2017, 2018 or 2019, the Group is eligible for the TidyTowns Grant. Eligible groups were contacted with details of how to apply for the extra funding. The closing date for applications was 19th March although some flexibility has been provided in this regard.</p>  <p>  I understand that the one of the groups referred to by the Deputy, Ballymore TidyTowns, was eligible to receive the grant but did not submit an application. While the closing date for applications has passed, my Department is open to receiving an application from this group on an exceptional basis provided that the application for funding is submitted immediately. Officials from my Department will liaise directly with the group in this regard. </p>  <p>  I further understand that the second group, Baylin TidyTowns, has not entered the competition since 2009. This Group is not eligble for funding as they must have entered the competition in at least one of the years 2017, 2018 or 2019.  </p></reply>

For the purposes of the 2014-2022 LEADER Programme, County Cork is divided into 3 sub-regional areas, with a Local Action Group (LAG) in each area delivering separate Local Development Strategies. </p>  <p>  Under the current LEADER Programme, the Cork West Local Action Group (LAG) is responsible for the delivery and implementation of LEADER Programme in West Cork. </p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the programme the Implementing Partners have employed a number of staff, including Project/Development Officers for the implementation of the Programme in the West Cork area and thus the role of the development officer is currently in place for this programme.</p></reply>
