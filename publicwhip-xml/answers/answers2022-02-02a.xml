The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.I appreciate people's frustration when they are living close to a fibre network owned by a commercial operator, but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 21 January, almost 294,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 11 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary and over 54,400 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties. In County Meath surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Dunboyne/Clonee, Navan and Hill of Down, with over 10,000 premises surveyed and over 3,000 premises under construction to date, with over 2,000 of those premises located in the areas around Bettystown, Julianstown, Duleek and Bellewstown  to be completed in H1 2022, as advised by NBI.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Meath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p><p>Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 21 January, 454 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Syddan Gaelic Football Club (approx. 6.7km from premises referred to), Drumree GAA Club, Rathkenny Hall, Meath GAA Centre of Excellence, Cormeen Sports Complex, Teach Raithneach Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural Centre, Meath Hill Community Centre, Castletown GAA Club, Boardsmill GAA Club/Community Centre, Kilskyre GAA Club, Moynalty GAA Club, Ballinlough Shop &amp;amp; Former Halfway House Public House, Bective GAA Clubrooms, Cortown GAA Club and Carnaross Mart. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p><p>Kentstown National School, Gaelscoil na M&iacute;, Gaelscoil an Bhrad&aacute;in Fheasa and Newtown National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December 2020 with an ambition to connect some 679 schools to high speed broadband by the end of 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframes across the NBP fibre program. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. I understand from the Deputy that the matter raised in this specific instance has already been submitted to the complaint resolution service offered by CRU. The CRU, as the Deputy will appreciate, is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. I have no function in these matters.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.   A range of home energy improvements can be funded under this scheme. The upgrades that are recommended for any given property depend on many factors including age, size, type and condition of the property. Each eligible home is assessed on a case-by-case basis by SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent. This involves a survey of the home which determines the upgrades that can be installed and funded. The home is subsequently allocated to a contractor which carries out a further assessment of the property to confirm the initial recommendation.  A programme of work is then agreed between the contractor and SEAI. Decisions in relation to the recommended upgrades made by both SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent and contractors are informed by a technical operations manual</p>  <p>  From 1 November 2019, new building standards have applied to major renovations on existing residential dwellings. This means where renovations affecting more than 25% of the surface area of a home (e.g. external wall insulation) are being carried out the energy performance of the whole home must be upgraded to new energy efficiency standards. This means that older heating systems in these homes must be replaced with newer, more efficient models.</p>  <p>  My department has contacted SEAI and they have been informed that the works on this home including the heating system upgrade have been agreed with the homeowner and allocated to a contractor and will commence in due course.</p></reply>

Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP and those households must source their own accommodation in the private rental sector. </p>  <p>  Under HAP, households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports. To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988. The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder service, is a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  As reported in Parliamentary Question No. 308 of 25 January 2022 the total expenditure by my Department on the HAP scheme in 2021 was &euro;541.7 million.

This includes the delivery of 47,600 new build social homes and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026. Under Housing for All, each local authority was required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and affordable housing delivery in the period 2022-2026. </p><p>The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation was enacted last July, establishing a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through; (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands; (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental; (3) a First Home shared equity scheme; and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>The delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 and the funding being made available, will be underpinned by local authorities' housing Delivery Action Plans. In drawing up their plans, each local authority assessed the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) and will plan provision accordingly.My Department is currently liaising with local authorities to finalise affordable housing targets at local authority level for the period 2022-2026.  </p><p>In September 2021, I issued social housing targets for build and long-term lease to all local authorities for 2022-2026.  Details of the targets for each local authority are set out in the table below. </p><p> </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.    </p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords and to impose sanctions, where appropriate. The RTB has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.  </p>  <p>  The powers granted to the RTB since July 2019 has brought about a fundamental change in the operation of the RTB by expanding its regulatory remit. The RTB has set up a dedicated Investigations and Sanctions Unit which includes 15 staff members with a collective experience in conducting civil and criminal investigations in other regulatory and enforcement bodies as well as significant internal knowledge of the RTB and the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  Following recommendations in the RTB Workforce Plan (2018 &ndash; 2021) and engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), the RTB has received sanction for an additional 41 staff since 2019 to ensure that its enhanced powers and additional legislative provisions are fully implemented and enforced, and to advise my Department on any necessary further reform along with its implementation.</p></reply>

A total of 7,824 social homes were delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes in 2020, with a further 5,187 social homes delivered in the first nine months of 2021.  Data for Quarter 4 is being collated and will be published in due course.  </p>  <p>  In relation to affordable homes for purchase and rent, the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 establish the basis for two new affordable purchase schemes and a cost rental scheme.  The Covid-19 pandemic, and associated closure and restrictions of construction sites, had significant impacts on the anticipated timelines for the delivery for Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) and Affordable Housing Fund (AHF, previously known as the Serviced Site Fund (SSF)) supported housing developments. However, 65 Cost Rental Units, supported by CREL were delivered during 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold details on the numbers of new private homes or new private rental homes completed during this period. Data published by the CSO shows that 20,433 new homes were completed in 2021 and 20,526 new homes were completed in 2020.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing across all tenures is a priority for the Government.

Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include: </p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5. </p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot  with costings to be set by my  Department in consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI. </p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home.  </p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000. </p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process. </p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard. - A new independent appeals process will be introduced. </p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes will also be examined.</p>  <p>  Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/</p>  <p>  I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline.</p>  <p>  In the immediate term I am making amendments to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 which will allow for the recoupment of Engineer fees to homeowners who have applied for entry into the scheme. Furthermore, as part of these amended regulations, &euro;5,000 will be recoupable as an allowable cost under the scheme for essential immediate repair works which are deemed necessary by a homeowners engineer under a Building Condition Assessment report.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department, including the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also held several additional discussions with the Russian Ambassador in this regard. </p>  <p>  In the course of this engagement with the Russian authorities, I raised a number of concerns in relation to the naval exercises, in particular in the context of the current political and security environment in Europe. I also drew attention to the concerns of the Government and other stakeholders in respect of the potential impact on fisheries and on other marine life in the area of the planned exercises.</p>  <p>  On 29 January, I received a response from Minister Shoygu, confirming that the exercise will be relocated outside of Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone. I have welcomed this response.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland remains concerned at the wider security situation in Europe.

We have also cautioned very strongly against unilateral action by the UK Government in this most sensitive space.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has conveyed these concerns to Prime Minister Johnson, and at every available opportunity I have underlined this message to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In engagements with my EU counterparts, I have made clear the Government&rsquo;s position when I update them on the latest developments with respect to Northern Ireland.  We have also been very clear in our interventions in the Council of Europe that the rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.

I am in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, with the party leaders in Northern Ireland, and with victims and civil society organisations as we continue to press for progress on this issue.  </p>  <p>  The Government agreed to take part, together with the UK Government and the Northern Ireland parties, in a legacy engagement process which began in July last year, with the aim of finding a collective way forward on these issues. We also continue to raise individual legacy cases and the urgent need for access to information, including with respect to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the murder of Pat Finucane.</p>  <p>  The Government has of course noted the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's report into the RUC's handling of paramilitary attacks by the UDA/UFF between 1989 and 1993, which resulted in 19 murders and multiple attempted murders. Within this report, the Ombudsman has identified collusive behaviours and raised significant concerns about police conduct. This is an important report and we are studying it carefully. </p>  <p>  The publication of this report was undoubtedly a significant and emotional moment for the families who lost loved ones as a result of this violence, and indeed for all families across the island who have shared that terrible experience and have had to campaign for decades to access the truth.  It has been the consistent position of the Government that all families deserve access to information and a process of justice for their loved one, regardless of the perpetrator. Too many families have been waiting for too long.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive legacy framework, as we set out in the Stormont House Agreement, is urgently needed.  We will continue to work for the implementation of such a framework, in order to support wider societal reconciliation, build greater community confidence in policing and meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently engaged with the British Government at all levels to make clear that a Statute of Limitations is not an approach we could support, and to caution strongly against unilateral action in this area. Only a collective approach, that meets the needs of families and upholds our shared human rights obligations, can be the way forward on this most sensitive of issues.

The Strategy covers all countries on the African continent in a single strategic approach engaging political, economic, cultural, and development relations.</p>  <p>  The Africa Strategy also sets out the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s expanded presence in Africa, including a number of new Embassies in North and West Africa by 2025, in parallel with a deepening of existing strong relationships across the continent.   As part of the Strategy a new Embassy was opened in Rabat, Morocco, during 2021, bringing the current total number of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassies across the African continent up to thirteen, and providing an opportunity for Ireland to build our visibility in Morocco and the wider region including through the Embassy&rsquo;s secondary accreditations. </p>  <p>  Also in 2021, the Government announced its intention to open a new Embassy in Dakar, Senegal, if possible by the end of 2022. Ireland&rsquo;s new Embassy in Dakar will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Senegal and significantly contribute towards the advancing of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests in francophone West Africa and the Sahel.

Construction is expected to take two years and is scheduled to commence within the next twelve months.</p>  <p>  Japan is an important and like minded partner for Ireland. As the third largest economy in the world, Japan is a vital market for Irish goods and services and an important source of foreign direct investment. The new Ireland House will be a symbol of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to its relationship with Japan and our ambition to develop this further. </p>  <p>  The vision for this new &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; building is to provide an exceptional platform for Ireland to deepen our engagement in Japan in future years. In addition, the new building will help raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile in Japan and showcase our cultural heritage, creativity and innovation through excellence in design. The building will meet the highest sustainability standards.</p>  <p>  Located in Yotsuya district in central Tokyo, Ireland House will be home to offices for the Embassy and the State Agencies and the official accommodation of the Ambassador. The building will also house a multi-use event and exhibition space for culture, promotion and business and will be a meeting place for the Irish community in Japan.</p>  <p>  An international Design Competition was held to identify a design for the architects for the building, with Dublin based architects firm Henry J Lyons announced as the winning team in September 2020.</p></reply>

The Review Group have been specifically asked to advise on whether further work is required to examine issues of an historical nature and to make any recommendations regarding how this might be pursued. </p><p>The Review Group will provide me with an interim report after six months. A final report is expected within 9 months. I will bring the Final Review Report to Government, who may consider any further bodies of work that might be necessary, taking into account the findings of the Independent Review Group. Thereafter, I intend to make the Final Review Report public.</p><p>I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Secretary General and Chief of Staff, to ensure that every member of the Defence Forces, can carry out their duties in a safe and respectful workplace based on dignity, equality and zero-tolerance for any kind of unacceptable behaviour.</p></reply>

Under this &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension scheme, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years and the pension is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. </p><p>Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;9.21 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years&rsquo; service.  This gives a maximum additional increment of &euro;92.10 weekly. However, under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable if and when the pensioner reaches the prescribed age for the State Pension (Contributory), that is, currently at age 66. </p><p>These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, such as the State Pension (Contributory).  </p><p><i>Integration </i>means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of their occupational pension payable. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension or similar contributory Social Welfare benefit is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. </p><p>The person in question (details supplied) qualified for maximum pension and retirement benefits immediately upon his retirement in 2013 at age 52, having completed more than 31 years service.  The integration process will only begin when his state pension becomes payable, currently at age 66.</p><p>Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of State Pension payable (&euro;253.30 a week currently if under age 80) is considerably more than any reduction that will happen under the Defence Forces pension schemes by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension.</p><p>It might be noted that the method of integration for &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is in fact more favourable than in other areas of the public service.  In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the occupational pension commences payment, for example from age 60/65 where &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; pensions apply in pre-2013 public service schemes</p></reply>

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points.  A number of other proposals submitted to my Department were also considered.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government yesterday, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. </p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  I have also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.</p>  <p>  I believe that the decision announced will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals.</p><p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p><p>Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again next month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p><p>I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021.  </p><p>The following points are noted in this guidance: </p><p>o The guidance provide to all schools advised that &ldquo;the over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms during periods of colder weather. </p><p>o Similarly ensuring that at the end of the school day each evening, the windows in each room are opened (as wide as is practical and safe, while also considering security issues) for at least 15 minutes to ventilate the room fully will ensure that the classrooms are ventilated from the night before and this does not need to be repeated prior to class in the morning. During this first class of the school day windows should, weather conditions permitting, be partially opened (as per guidance in this document) to keep the room fresh and prevent stuffiness and condensation etc. This is in addition to and complements the end-of-day ventilation described above.  </p><p>- Achieving fresh air by having a number of windows partially opened as required rather than one window fully open can help to maximise the use of window driven natural ventilation distribution across the room without causing discomfort. In colder weather any local chilling effect can be offset by partially opening the windows nearest to and above the radiators.  </p><p>- As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their boilers operation temperatures are set at the recommended manufacturers&rsquo; guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school. </p><p>- In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open (partially when classrooms are in use and fully when not in use) in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels&rdquo;  </p><p>To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021.  The minor works funding is a capital grant and provides good flexibility to address issues at local school level. The works</p><p>that can be undertaken under the primary minor works scheme include maintenance and small-scale improvements to school buildings and grounds, improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor coverings and window blinds and the purchase of IT related equipment.</p><p>Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required. </p><p>My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme. The main grant is the capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating costs.</p><p>My Department has ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p><p>As you are aware the Department has also issued additional funding to schools to support the implementation of infection prevention and control measures required to help minimise the risk of Covid-19.  Funding has recently issued to cover the new term.  </p></reply>

Any such scheme would also require a more significant operation than that which currently underpins the administration of my Department&rsquo;s free travel scheme, as it would have to grant and withdraw potentially huge number of passes each year given that many people may only be in receipt of a means tested payment from my Department for a short period.  Any such scheme may also prove to be extremely costly.   </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It aims to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding.</p><p>During Phase 1 of the Plan, which began in 2021 and is expected to last 2-3 years, childminding-specific regulations will be developed that are proportionate and appropriate to childminders, as will childminder-specific training. In addition, primary legislation will be amended, and there will be further engagement and consultation with childminders. </p><p>The Steering Group met for the first time on 14 September 2021, and met again on 1 December. Its role is to drive, oversee and monitor implementation. The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Communications; Training and Support; Funding and Financial Supports, and Regulation and Inspection. The first two Advisory Groups have already commenced their work. The third and fourth Advisory Groups will be established in the coming months. </p><p>Extensive consultation with parents, childminders and representative bodies took place throughout the development of the Plan and continues in the implementation phase that has now begun. Representative bodies and childminders are members of the Steering and Advisory Groups. Ongoing consultation will be critical to effective implementation, and work is underway to develop a Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Communications strategy.</p><p>Phase 2 will be a transition phase lasting 3-5 years, which will see new regulations coming into force, access opened to the National Childcare Scheme, transitional training requirements, and expansion of supports.</p><p>Phase 3 will involve full implementation, with the end of transitional arrangements, and childminders regulated and able to access multiple supports.</p><p>To support implementation of the National Action Plan, a National Childminding Coordinator has been appointed, as well as a City/County Childcare Committee Lead for Childminding and six regional Childminding Development Officers within the City/County Childcare Committees. Six additional Childminding Development Officers will be appointed by City/County Childcare Committees shortly. </p></reply>

Measures introduced to support public health guidelines have unavoidably led to a reduction in processing capacity across all areas at certain times. My Department constantly manages and reviews the allocation of resources to ensure that they are optimised to meet business requirements and that staff are allocated where they are most needed. </p><p>Despite these challenges, in 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015. My Department is also taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of citizenship applications during 2022.</p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, immigration permissions have been extended nine times and as a result, people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 31 May 2022.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers. It is currently operating 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday (8am to 8pm) and 8 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday (9am to 5pm). There are between 15 and 20 customer service representatives taking calls and making appointments. All appointments for customers to register their immigration permission are now issued through this service, with operators offering one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. Almost 9,000 registration appointments have been booked to date and are scheduled to take place between now and April.</p><p>Demand for first-time appointments is tracked by the number of people coming forward to seek appointments, along with information provided to my Department by educational institutions, businesses, Government agencies such as the IDA, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p>The processing of renewals for Dublin based customers takes place fully online since July 2020, and currently takes between 8-10 weeks. In the meantime, customers continue to benefit from the extension of immigration permissions until May.</p><p>In 2021, the Registration Office in Burgh Quay processed 66,321 online renewals and 15,125 first time registrations and issued 6,805 re-entry visas.</p><p>Visa applications are processed in a number of Visa Offices overseas, in my Department's Visa Office in Dublin, and at Embassies of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which process certain visa applications under delegated sanction from my Department.</p><p>The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as the volumes and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result. Processing times are regularly updated on my Department's website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/. </p><p>Further statistical details on applications across a number of immigration-related operational areas are set out in the attached tables, for the Deputy's information.</p></reply>

Regrettably, this included the suspension of physical visits to prisoners for extended periods of time.  However, the Service introduced a new video visit system to ensure that prisoners could continue to have visual contact with their families throughout this time. </p>  <p>  In addition, in order to enhance contact with families the Service introduced phones into cells in newer prisons where technically feasible. Owing to the success of this initiative the Service has commenced a project to install telephones into all cells across the prison estate.  In-cell phones have been introduced in Castlerea, Cork, Cloverhill and Limerick Prison not including the female wing.  The practice currently available in the female wing in Limerick Prison is a telephone is provided in each cell and a line is made available to prisoners on request to facilitate phone calls in the privacy of their cells.</p>  <p>  The construction of a new prison facility to provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners in Limerick Prison is advanced and is scheduled to become operational in the third quarter of 2022. The new accommodation will contain a telephone in each cell and the design of the facility is based on the principle of rehabilitation and normalisation recognising the unique requirements of female offenders. </p>  <p>  In-cell phones are currently being installed in Midlands Prison and the next phase of this project will see in-cell telephones installed in Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons and a procurement process is currently in place to facilitate this process. </p>  <p>  The provision of in-cell telephones facilitates outbound calls by prisoners from their cells.</p></reply>

In 2016 a new purpose designed modern prison opened in Cork replacing the old prison facility. Similarly a major construction project is currently nearing completion at Limerick Prison which will provide a new accommodation block for male and female prisoners, along with relevant rehabilitation and support facilities and will end the practice of slopping out at Limerick Prison.  I understand that &lsquo;slopping out&rsquo; in Limerick should cease in early Q3 2022. However, this timeframe assumes no further impact by Covid on supply chain or construction staff</p><p>Exploratory engineering surveys have been undertaken at E block, Portlaoise Prison to explore the options of providing in-cell sanitation along with other work to upgrade the cellular accommodation having regard to the age and fabric of the building.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that a contract has been awarded for the construction of a sample cell at E block.

Applications will be accepted for six months until 31 July 2022, when the scheme will close. The scheme is only open to those who do not have a current permission to reside in the State and will enable eligible applicants to remain and reside in the State and to regularise their residency status. </p><p>The fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for the scheme which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process. A fee of &euro;700 will generally apply to family unit applications and children up to 23 years, living with their parent(s), can be included in a family unit application. A fee of &euro;550 will apply to individual applications. There is no provision for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p>Successful applicants to the scheme will be required to register their permission granted and everyone over the age of 18 years will be required to pay a registration fee of &euro;300. </p><p>Full details regarding the qualifying criteria, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document and the required documentation for the scheme is available on my Department's website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/regularisation-of-long-term-undocumented-migrant-scheme/. </p><p>As previously announced, international protection applicants who have an outstanding application for international protection and have been in the asylum process for a minimum of two years will have a separate application process. The International Protection Office of my Department will contact potentially eligible applicants shortly with further details, which will also be made available on the website . There will also be a six month application window for this strand of the scheme from the date it is launched. There will be no application or registration fee associated with this strand. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-02a.289.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020200088#WRF05400"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to tackling anti-social behaviour (ASB) and ensuring that people both feel safe and are safe in their communities. </p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB). The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of ASB on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p>  <p>  Arising from the work of the subgroup on the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes, funding of almost &euro;200,000 is being provided to eight community-based projects to work with young people involved in the anti-social use of scramblers and quad bikes and related crime. My Department welcomes additional applications from other YDPs and is working with a number to support them in developing additional local scrambler initiatives.</p>  <p>  The knife crime subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform policy on knife crime, with particular reference to effectiveness of proposals, to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and I also published the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 last year, which provides a developmental framework to support children and young people subject to multiple disadvantage and guide them away from involvement in anti-social or criminal behaviours. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority within the Strategy is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 YDPs. In Budget 2022, an additional &euro;6.7 million was provided to kick-start this process.</p>  <p>  The new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland - that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone. The Bill will help to achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs). The Partnerships will develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves, which are likely to include measures to address issues such as ASB.</p>  <p>  LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees (JPCs). Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities as well as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The factors underlying the incidence of crime and ASB are the subject of ongoing academic and expert research and the Department engages with the research community to monitor trends and emerging evidence.  </p>  <p>  With regard to anti-social behaviour involving children and young people, the Department has a strategic research partnership with the University of Limerick known as the REPPP project (Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice). The REPPP team is involved in the design and implementation of a number of internationally recognised cutting edge initiatives such as the Greentown initiative and the Bail Supervision Scheme. </p>  <p>  Although anti-social behaviour is sometimes represented as a youth-related problem, crime figures show that relevant offences occur across a wide age range, underlining the need for a considered and evidence informed approach to developing measures to counter ASB. </p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, and the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027, work is underway to examine if further measures to divert young adults away from criminal or anti-social behaviour can be developed as an alternative to prosecution in appropriate cases. It is intended that issues will be the subject of a public consultation process later this year. </p>  <p>  One of the further measures to be examined is that of restorative justice. These practices are used effectively in other jurisdictions to deter young people from crime as well as providing an alternative to criminal prosecution. Although there are certain restorative justice mechanisms available in this jurisdiction, it is expected that the public consultation process will include consideration of the improvement of the mechanisms currently in place and the introduction of new ones. </p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2022 will shortly be published by Minister McEntee and I, and will continue the Department&rsquo;s commitment to working with public sector colleagues, NGOs and wider society to deliver communities that are, and feel, safe for all members of society.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that while my Department is the lead Government Department on policy relating to anti-social behaviour, such behaviour has many underlying factors and measures to combat it fall under a wide variety of State agencies, bodies, offices and Government Departments. It is a key issue being addressed in a range of National Strategies, including the National Drugs and Alcohol Strategy, which is led by the Department of Health, as well as Garda Policing Plans and local authority area plans. The issue will also intersect with the forthcoming Domestic Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy.</p></reply>

It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7). This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant.</p>  <p>  As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people". It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. </p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other government departments continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.  </p><p>Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. </p><p>The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p><p>The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment. </p><p>Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health. The potential numbers in scope in the private sector nursing homes and hospices are difficult to confirm, however the most recent estimate available points to approximately 36,000 people employed in the private nursing home sector. It is not possible to determine the breakdown of who may or may not be in scope within these private organisations at this point.</p><p>The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

It has acknowledged the systemic failures that occurred over a sustained period of time and accepted the recommendations.</p>  <p>  There were many contributory factors that led to this catalogue of failures, including an absence of clinical oversight, appropriate governance and management structures.</p>  <p>  There are 35 recommendations in total in the report, including an assessment of a reconfiguration of the service. Work is under way to implement the full suite of recommendations as a matter of priority - six have already been implemented and 13 have commenced implementation.</p>  <p>  As part of the recommendations a full nationwide audit will be conducted of compliance with existing CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams. I have also directed that there be an independently led prescribing audit in each of the CAMHS teams. This will cover community and inpatient teams. There will be a further independent-led audit of case files in north Kerry.</p>  <p>  Alongside this, the HSE will commission qualitative research to identify the experiences of children, young people and their families using child and adolescent mental health services nationwide. I have directed that this three-stranded approach be subject to independent oversight. </p>  <p>  The HSE has met with 198 of the 240 young people affected, and their families, to discuss the deficits they received in their care and to provide them with key information and referral to any necessary services and supports. This includes counselling supports and appropriate services from within child and adult mental health services. I am in close contact with the chief officer of the area to ensure that any additional supports that are required are provided. The HSE apologised to each individual at these meetings, and subsequently in writing, for any harm caused.</p>  <p>  The Government has  committed to a non-adversarial scheme for compensation for those children, young people and families affected by the report. I will be working closely with my Department, the HSE and the Attorney General to ensure that the details of such a scheme are confirmed without delay. Many families have already been subjected to harm and considerable distress. I will do my utmost as Minister of State for mental health to reduce the potential for any further upset as this process continues.</p>  <p>  The report is shocking and frightening and my thoughts are still very much with the children and young people affected. The systems we have in place must be fit for purpose to support the good work that we know is going on as much as to bring to light and address what harm is caused. Accountability in this context is vital. I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Kerry is in receipt of the detailed and extensive final report, which will now be considered to see if there are grounds to commence a criminal investigation. While it is not appropriate to comment on HR or industrial relations matters relating to any individual, the CEO of the HSE has said that disciplinary action will be taken if appropriate.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the clear benefits to individuals and families in terms of quality of life indicators, remote working from hubs will also support local economies, reduce carbon emissions and may arrest or reverse the depopulation of certain areas.</p><p>My Department operates a number of funding schemes that focus on projects supporting remote working through the development of hubs and Broadband Connection Points as long-term, digitally-enabled community assets. To date, my Department has awarded approximately &euro;100 million to projects involved in developing remote working facilities under programmes such as the Rural Regeneration Development Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p><p>Last year, I awarded almost &euro;9 million in funding through the Connected Hubs Call to applicants across all regions.  This funding allowed for the expansion of existing hub facilities and remote working infrastructure in digital hubs throughout the country. </p><p>The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the strategic development of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery. </p><p>I am currently reviewing all my Department&rsquo;s funding streams and I will make an announcement shortly on the plans for 2022. </p></reply>
