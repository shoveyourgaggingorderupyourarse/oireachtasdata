    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-24a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400069#WRA00600"><p>There are approximately 140,000 local authority social housing properties in the State. it is important that local authorities ensure the optimum management and maintenance of this valuable State asset, that the homes comply with relevant standards and that vacancy and letting turnaround times are kept to a minimum.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting local authorities in the optimum management and maintenance of their housing stock and is working with them to transition from a largely response based approach to a strategic planned maintenance approach based on stock condition surveys.</p>  <p>  A national standardised stock condition survey template has been agreed, as has the implementation of a centrally hosted ICT system to support asset management. The ICT system is currently being procured by the Local Government Management Agency. The stock condition surveys will begin once the ICT system is in place and will be completed over a four to five year period. The start has been delayed somewhat during Covid restrictions and it is likely to be 2022 when surveys commence.</p>  <p>  Funding support from my Department is important in order to drive high standards and minimum vacancy within the local authority housing stock. </p>  <p>  In 2020, the largest ever voids programme was funded by my Department at a cost of &euro;56.4m. This allowed 3,607 properties to be refurbished and made available for allocation. A similar programme is underway in 2021 at a cost of &euro;44.7m to remediate 3,000 homes. The enhanced voids programmes in 2020 and 2021 will significantly reduce  legacy vacancy within the local authority housing stock and put both the local authorities and my Department in a good position to transition from a voids responsive approach to a planned maintenance funded approach to stock maintenance over the period 2022 and 2023.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities under the existing programmes of stock improvement works, such as, Voids, Disabled Persons Grants and Remedial Works Scheme during the transition to a planned maintenance approach over the years 2022 and 2023 but it is equally important that local authorities ensure adequate budgetary provision is made for housing repairs and cyclical maintenance as part of their annual budget process.</p></reply>

This engagement is currently underway although the in-ability to hold face to face discussions due to Covid restrictions has hampered the process. I understand, however, that such discussions will take place in the coming weeks in line with the relaxation of restrictions in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Change is difficult for any workforce. I am fully aware that many in the local government service do not necessarily wish to see changes to the current arrangements. However, the fact is that the Government has decided that Irish Water is to become a fully integrated, direct labour, national public utility. The status quo is not an option and continued uncertainty about the future does a disservice to everyone currently employed in the water services in local authorities. It is therefore important that the parties to the transformation process engage intensively over the coming weeks at the WRC to agree an outcome which will deliver for all parties.  </p>  <p>The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

The annual fee is typically set at &euro;125 but, to support the outdoors focus of Summer 2021, I recently set the 2021 licence fee at zero. Local Authorities can also, pursuant to Section 199(1) of the Local Government Act, 2001, make bye-laws to control the consumption of alcohol in public spaces. Many local authorities have such bye-laws in place and they typically allow for the consumption of alcohol at tables and chairs immediately adjacent to hotels, restaurants, public houses etc.</p>  <p>  The legislation relating to the serving of alcohol in licensed premises and the drinking of alcohol in public places comes under the remit of my colleague, Heather Humphreys, the Minister for Justice, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for policing the liquor licensing laws and public order generally. Licences allow for alcohol to be served and consumed on the premises, which can include areas outside the confines of the building. </p>  <p>  I have become aware recently of some engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and licensees regarding the consumption of alcohol outdoors in spaces licensed by local authorities. My officials are in ongoing contact with the Department of Justice to ensure that the safe operation of such outdoor dining areas continues to be facilitated. The Minister for Justice has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that discretion will continue to be applied by Garda&iacute; in their engagement with licensed premises. In addition to this, Minister Humphreys has also discussed this matter with the Attorney General and she is examining how legislative action could bring certainty to this complex area of law. </p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted for all, apart from the most vulnerable tenants. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) and subsequently, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provide that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during the period from 1 August 2020 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration.  </p><p>Measures introduced on 1 August 2020 assist tenants who might face rent arrears on foot of a rent increase. Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. The RTB will acknowledge receipt of the warning notice to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. </p><p>The Government published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 on 17 June 2021 which, if passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 12 July 2021, will extend the targeted protections of the PDRTA for a further 6 months until 12 January 2022.</p><p>Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period. </p><p>The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.  </p></reply>

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p>  <p>   Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access and Use.

A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p>  <p>  The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared  to support a  public consultation in the matter later this  year.</p></reply>

Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, and the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following:</p>  <p>  - the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;</p>  <p>  - the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;</p>  <p>  - the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;</p>  <p>  - the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;</p>  <p>  - the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation;</p>  <p>  - vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and/or</p>  <p>  - the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020 to temporarily modify the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations. Once the Minister for Health makes regulations restricting movement outside a 5 km radius of one's place of residence, the moratorium on evictions taking place will automatically apply.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced permanent protections to provide new procedures to be followed in the context of rent arrears warnings and associated tenancy terminations.</p>  <p>  Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days from 1 August 2020) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. </p>  <p>  The RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. If the tenant agrees, the RTB can help them to engage with MABS to resolve their rent arrears and sustain their tenancy. The aim of the new procedures is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.</p>  <p>  Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears on foot of Covid-19, enhanced protections and procedures now apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA).  The PDRTA provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 July 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 July 2021. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 July 2021.</p>  <p>  The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. The Government published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 on 17 June 2021 which, if passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 12 July 2021, will extend the targeted protections of the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie - including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

At the same time, it will also build confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply.  Budget 2021 had made available &euro;75m to support the scheme and it is estimated that this level of intervention could account for approximately 1%-2% of housing transactions annually.</p>  <p>  Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and the significant feedback has been factored in to the development process, and I am confident that the final design of the Scheme can mitigate any potential inflationary risks.</p>  <p>  A 2019 report by the UK C&amp;AG and the National Audit Office concluded that a similar scheme in England increased housing supply by 14.5% and prices by just 1% compared to homes not purchased under the scheme.  However, I intend to apply more targeted measures than the English scheme to ensure that potential risks can be addressed and mitigated before the introduction of the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme later this year. The Scheme will be specific to new builds, and will establish conditionality linked to maximum allowable home price by local authority area and maximum levels of equity support that will be made available. Any financial support provided will be limited to bridging the gap between the maximum mortgage available to the household and the open market price of the home.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the prices for new homes under the Scheme, the setting of maximum allowable home prices will informed by the CSO recorded median prices of new first-time buyer homes sold by area, thereby targeting homes in the lower half of recorded sales prices over the previous year. The proposed caps will be reviewed and finalised in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s deployment, and will be kept under review thereafter.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have previously confirmed that the scheme will be formally reviewed after one year of operation.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/8f3c71-public-consultation-on-the-revised-wind-energy-development-guideline/ </p>  <p>  The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are quite detailed and technical in nature.  My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) have analysed the submissions received in conjunction with the contracted SEA and noise consultants, and are in the process of preparing finalised guidelines having undertaken detailed consideration and analysis of the submissions received.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising the technical guidance on the noise aspect in conjunction with DECC (which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters). However, this piece of work is quite technical in nature and a small number of matters remain to be resolved in this regard.</p>  <p>  Once the outstanding issues have been finalised by both Departments, the proposed amendments will need to be reviewed by the SEA consultants in order to conclude the SEA process.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other forms of proposed development.  In this connection, it is not intended to place a moratorium on planning applications for wind farm developments as referred to pending the finalisation of the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines.</p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted. The standardised average rent rose by 2.5% to &euro;1,256 from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020 and remained at that level in Q4 2020.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during an emergency period, from 1 August 2020 until 10 January 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration.  This ban on rent increases was targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs.</p><p>The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provides that a rent increase is not permitted to take effect during an emergency period from 11 January 2021 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. This ban on rent increases is also targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs. The delimiting of landlords&rsquo; constitutionally protected property rights has been carefully and effectively targeted in this regard.</p><p>Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is not payable by relevant tenants in respect of the emergency periods identified above. It is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period. </p><p>The maximum rent increase is 4% per annum in RPZs, irrespective of the emergency legislation. Where a landlord carries out a rent review for the first time in  2 years in an RPZ, a total increase of 8% can apply. Where a rent increase cannot be given effect for certain tenants during an emergency period, a total increase of greater than 4% can apply where the necessary rent review notice(s) have been served. In all cases, a tenant must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice before a rent increase takes effect.</p><p>The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. The majority of tenants in the private rented sector have not been protected from rent increases since 1 August 2020. The Government published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 on 17 June 2021 which, if passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 12 July 2021, will extend the targeted protections of the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability.</p><p>The emergency protections against rent increases and evictions for the most vulnerable tenants has meant that they could remain in their home and not face higher rent during the pandemic.  </p><p>My Department, the Housing Agency and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) keep the operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 under constant review and any necessary legislation will be progressed without delay to help provide long term security of tenure for tenants at affordable rents.</p></reply>

This capital will be utilised by the LDA to support the delivery of its projects, including the acquisition of land, on an economic basis in line with the provisions of the Bill. </p>  <p>  The LDA has been progressing significant preparatory work on its existing sites made available to them with potential for 4,000 homes and is also developing a pipeline of additional sites.  </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the LDA Bill details how sites will be acquired by the LDA. With respect to public lands, on disposal of any land by a relevant public body, the land must first be offered for sale to the LDA. The LDA shall also furnish a report to Government every 2 years detailing how public lands are being utilised and identifying any lands which may be appropriate for the LDAs objectives. On receipt of such a report, the Government can direct a relevant public body to dispose of its land to the LDA. The LDA will also be empowered to purchase lands on the open market. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the LDA is required to pay market value for the purchase of public land, there will a minimum 50% affordable housing delivery requirement for relevant public lands under Part 9 of the LDA Bill, which will be 80% for such public lands in Dublin and Cork City.  This will be in addition to the increased 20% Part V social and affordable housing obligation being introduced under the Affordable Housing Bill. As such from an LDA financing perspective, the market value of such public lands will likely be significantly reduced to a nominal level in terms of the purchase price that the LDA will pay.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-24a.69.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400070#WRB04400"><p>The funding system for local authorities is complex, with authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government. Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, population distribution, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, all factors which should be taken into account when comparing levels of funding in different local authority areas. </p>  <p>  Most of the funding from Central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department provided &euro;51.1m and &euro;82.9m to Galway County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 rates waiver and other Covid related expenses that occurred in 2020.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of that process, to vary the ARV and LPT in order to increase the revenue available to them.  I understand that Galway County Council has opted not to use these tools for many years. </p>  <p>  The power to vary LPT is a reserved function and local authorities must balance those priorities against available resources. To achieve that balance, the elected members must make informed and necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income. For 2021, 22 of the local authorities throughout the country opted to vary their local property tax upwards while only three have opted to vary it downwards. Arising from these variation decisions, the local authority sector will gain an additional &euro;11.5 million from LPT when compared with 2020. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Galway County elected members decided not to vary the LPT rate for 2021.  My Department, as a matter of course, does not provide supplementary funding to local authorities in lieu of LPT changes; to do so would undermine one of the reasons LPT was introduced, which is to strengthen the link between the decision making of elected members of local authorities and services provided in the area. This has consistently been the position since 2015. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing about reforms in the workings of LPT. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D., recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the Local Property Tax. The legislation required to implement those changes falls under the remit of the Department of Finance as a tax policy matter and will be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  Finally, on 13 April 2021, I met with a delegation from Galway County Council and agreed that my Department will work with Galway County Council to explore the options available to putting their finances on a more sustainable footing. </p></reply>

Subject to the impact of COVID-19, this investment will fund the delivery of 12,750 new social homes in 2021, including 9,500 new build homes.  In December 2020, I issued delivery targets for 2021 to each local authority, with Mayo County Council set a target to deliver 156 new homes, including 91 new build homes.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Construction Status Report is published each quarter and provides scheme level detail on social housing new build activity in each local authority, including Mayo.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, the owners of dwellings located within the counties of Kildare, Meath or Offaly or the administrative areas of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin or Limerick City and County Council, are eligible to apply for remediation works under the scheme. </p>  <p>  &euro;20m was provided under Budget 2021 to cover the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2021. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 300 additional dwellings in 2021 and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approx. &euro;166m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014. </p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that 2,889 applications have been received under Scheme and, so far, 2,413 dwellings have been included. A further 108 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, 108 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process and 260 applications were not successful.

This represents a decrease of 6,813 households or 9.9% on the last assessment in June 2019. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 61,880, a reduction of 32.4%.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The oversight and management of the lists of qualified households awaiting accommodation, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with Sections 20 and 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment and Allocation Regulations, respectively.</p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme. There are many and varied reasons why some households may remain on the social housing waiting list for a longer period, generally associated with the size and type of home required and the availability of such homes  in the areas of choice selected by the applicant household. It is however, important to note that HAP is a flexible and immediate support which is available to all eligible households in all local authority areas across the State.</p>  <p>  With regard to reducing waiting times, increasing the supply of social, affordable and private housing is a priority for this Government. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of 50,000 new social homes with a focus on new build homes.  </p>  <p>  In 2021, the Government has made available &euro;3.3 billion for housing delivery programmes.  Subject to delays arising from COVID-19 restrictions, this funding will support the delivery of 12,750 social homes through Build, Acquisition and Leasing, including 9,500 new build homes. The Government will be publishing a new housing strategy in the coming weeks, which will set out details of social housing delivery for 2021-2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards.  In addition to supporting households in homes allocated by local authorities, eligible households are supported in the private rental market through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p>  <p>  Also, my Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on all social housing delivery activity. This is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/ </p></reply>

Information on the schemes that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at: </p>  <p>  www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund/, and </p>  <p>  www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf/. </p>  <p>  In addition to the 35 SSF projects referenced in the links above, approval in principle has also been given to five additional projects - Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road (Dublin City Council), Shanganagh (D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council), Hayestown and Ballymastone (Fingal County Council). </p>  <p>  Cumulatively, these 40 SSF projects, across 14 local authorities, will assist in the delivery of just over 4,200 affordable home to buy or rent. My Department continues to engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects, with the first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase under the SSF later this year being the Boherboy project in Cork City. </p>  <p>  In making an application for SSF funding, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with purchase prices of at least 10% below open market values, with the reduction remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill. </p>  <p>  In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help these first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will also place a new form of tenure in Cost Rental on a statutory basis for the first time. Cost Rental directly links rents to the cost of provision rather than market dynamics. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway. The first Cost Rental homes in Ireland, 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, will be delivered by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies in Quarter 3 2021. Dublin City Council is also progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill. </p>  <p>  The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters. </p>  <p>  In addition to the aforementioned measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a site in Shanganagh, County Dublin.  Approximately 34% of the units will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: www.lda.ie/. </p>  <p>On 4 May last, the Government also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements.  </p>  <p>  Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are already available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. </p>  <p>  The Help to Buy Initiative may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx. The availability of the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers can help secure the required level of deposit for a new home. </p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, which operated by my Department, is designed to enable creditworthy first-time buyers, who are unable to access a mortgage from a commercial lender, to obtain sustainable mortgage lending to purchase a new or second-hand property. </p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines. Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property. </p>  <p>  Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified. </p>  <p>  Exceptions to the above can be made where an applicant/applicants can clearly demonstrate a consistent and credible record of savings or rent payment through their bank account which, at a minimum, is equal to the proposed monthly loan repayment. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy, &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo;, will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years. </p></reply>

The Bill was introduced into the Oireachtas in May 2021 and was passed by the Seanad on 18 June.  </p>  <p>  Three pilot Cost Rental projects are already underway, including 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, which are under construction by the Tuath and Respond AHBs, and are scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2021. A project led by Dublin City Council at Emmet Road, Inchicore (site of the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) is at the design stage, while an LDA-led project at Shanganagh Castle, Shankill has planning permission and is expected to commence construction later this year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35m in funding for a new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, under which the Government will make loans on favourable terms to AHBs for up to 30% of the cost of new homes for Cost Rental. A Call for Proposals from AHBs opened on 14 December 2020 and closed on 5 January 2021. These applications were then assessed by officials in my Department and the Housing Agency. On 8 February 2021 I gave approval in principle for CREL funding this year of 390 new homes, located across eight sites in Dublin, the surrounding Greater Dublin Area, and Cork, to be owned and managed by the Cl&uacute;id, Respond, and Tuath AHBs. Further details of these new homes, including the specific locations, will be released when the successful AHBs have completed commercial and contractual arrangements.  It was initially anticipated that all of these Cost Rental homes would be delivered in 2021 though following the Covid related closure of construction sites, some may move to Q1 in 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition, the LDA is tasked to work with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, on the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. </p>  <p>  Work has also progressed on a new multi-year housing strategy "Housing for All", which the Government intend to publish next month. This strategy will build on our commitments in the Programme for Government and provide a roadmap to outline how we get to a housing system that gives us the sustainable supply we need, at a price that people can afford, and with appropriate housing options for all. As such, delivery targets for Cost Rental homes for 2022 will be set as part of this process.</p></reply>

The IDG is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD).  The IDG has met four times since its inaugural meeting in November.  </p>  <p>  In parallel with the IDG, a Town Centre First Advisory Group was also established to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development, and to support the work of the IDG. The Group, which I chair, comprises individual representatives from a broad range of sectors to ensure effective and diverse representation with the capacity and experience to contribute in a meaningful way to the preparation and implementation of a practical TCF framework.  The work of the Advisory Group has been advanced primarily through written submissions and bi-lateral meetings with the Co-chairs of the IDG and also the chairs of three IDG working groups that were also established to further inform and underpin the work of the Advisory Group and the IDG.  </p>  <p>  Following the initial development stages through the forum of the IDG and Advisory Group, four key pillar areas are now in development as part of a TCF framework, via the support of three dedicated working groups which reflect the first three pillars below, tasked with addressing the following:</p>  <p>  - Governance &amp;amp; Enabling Structures;</p>  <p>  - Economic &amp;amp; Social Purpose;</p>  <p>  - Living Towns Approach;</p>  <p>  - Investment &amp;amp; Resources.</p>  <p>  The fourth pillar, Investment and Resources, is cross-cutting and will draw on the combined work of the other three pillars.  Work has progressed well and draft working group papers are currently concluding for discussion, initially with the IDG and the Advisory Group, over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The aim is that the Inter-Departmental Group will conclude its work over July/August in order to provide recommendations for consideration by Government shortly afterwards.  </p>  <p>  There is general consensus among all the groups that there is no one solution or issue that can or should be addressed in isolation but rather that a TCF framework should be holistic and capable of being tailored to address the individual needs, size and characteristics of a town.  It is envisaged that recommendations will cover the short, medium and longer-term out to 2040, to align with Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

This policy statement was published by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health in 2019. The policy statement is available on my Department's website at:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/special-housing-needs/older-people/housing-options-our-ageing-population-policy-statement.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the Implementation Group will provide its final report addressing each of the 40 actions, by the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society and supporting renters is a key component of that. The Affordable Housing Bill 2020 will ensure that affordability is put at the heart of the housing system and will underpin the introduction of a new national Cost Rental scheme. This year will also see the first ever cost rental units, more than 400 units, built and occupied in the State. Cost rental is targeted at moderate income households where the rent charged only covers the cost of provision of homes. The Land Development Agency will be put on a statutory footing and given capital to ramp up cost rental provision to the scale needed.  </p>  <p>  In addition to social housing rental accommodation provided specifically by local authorities for older people, Approved Housing Bodies who provide affordable rented housing for people who cannot afford to pay private sector rents or buy their own homes often focus on specific accommodation for particular groups, such as older people.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for people who have a long-term housing need. If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.   </p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, tenants source their own accommodation in the private rented market. The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - 'Our Shared Future', commits to improving the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing Residential Tenancies Board enforcement and examining incentives for long-term leasing.</p>  <p>  Proposals for further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts are currently being developed, for inclusion in the General Scheme of the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill which is expected to be submitted in the coming months for Government approval to proceed to legal drafting. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted by the end of 2021. Long-term letting rights for tenants are being considered in this context.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I again extend my sympathies to the families concerned. It is important that we respect peoples privacy while working to establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available. </p>  <p>  A review of homeless deaths was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) by Dr. Austin O&rsquo;Carroll, the HSE appointed Clinical Lead for Covid-19 and Homelessness in Dublin.  The review analysed the available data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. This &lsquo;Interim Report on Mortality in Single Homeless Population 2020&rsquo; was submitted to me earlier this month.  Owing to certain data limitations, including Covid-19 restrictions limiting access to coroner&rsquo;s reports, the report will be subject to revision when further data becomes available. I have met with Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll to discuss his Report and its recommendations. </p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been discussed at the Task Force. </p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital.  This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of accommodation.  But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.</p>  <p>  In addition to the recent Report, and relevant to its recommendations in respect of improving data in this area, a separate feasibility study on data collection of deaths nationally of people, who had been sleeping rough or accessing homeless services, is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health.

In those situations, it can make sense for local authorities to undertake acquisitions in a targeted and strategic manner.</p>  <p>  I have directed local authorities and AHBs where they undertake such targeted acquisitions, that they do not compete with private purchasers and leave value in the market particularly for first-time buyers. However within these constraints, acquisitions by local authorities can be cheaper than construction and allows them to make best use of existing housing stock. I have also asked local authorities to increasingly target vacant and derelict properties that can be brought back to use as part of new public housing delivery.</p>  <p>  Where local authorities and AHBs engage with developers to acquire newly developed housing through turnkey arrangements, this is done on the basis that there is not undue interference in private housing supply and in most cases, the developments are ones that would not have been undertaken without the interest of a local authority or an AHB.</p>  <p>  I am determined that the Government&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; national strategy will put in place the resources to deliver new public housing based in the main on delivery by local authorities, AHBs and State agencies with property acquisitions from the open market being a targeted and strategic aspect only of delivery.</p></reply>

Local authorities have been advised that design- build rapid delivery approaches should be adopted where appropriate to deliver social housing projects on local authority-owned land.</p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of design-build contractors in 2017. This framework which expired in February 2021, was available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.  While some local authorities have progressed projects using the framework, the scope of works was generally limited to certain development sizes and unit types. On this basis, other local authorities have implemented their own frameworks, while some have tendered on individual projects for design-build contractors, on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  The Housing Delivery and Co-ordination Office and my Department are currently working with the OGP on replacement frameworks which will operate on a regional basis and cater to a variety of development sizes and unit types, including apartments. In addition, Dublin City Council has developed a framework of design-build contractors for the delivery of a volumetric programme of houses and apartments which is available to all local authorities and AHBs to use on larger projects. It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track homes will be built using the Dublin City framework, and while the majority of these will be in Dublin, there will also likely be schemes in other large centres.</p>  <p>  Many of the issues around delivery that &lsquo;standard&rsquo; social housing construction projects face, are also faced by design-build projects, such as preparing sites, services/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.  There can however, be savings in terms of programme and construction with these advantages growing as more use is made of these frameworks and as contractors gain more experience in implementing these methods. Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the design-build services of specialist contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. As well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, the new frameworks will provide sustainable and durable quality housing. All new dwellings (including modular build units) must comply with the building regulations and building control requirements and for social housing achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units, including through design-build schemes. </p></reply>

I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I expect final updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising them that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department.</p>  <p>   It is noteworthy that there is strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years &ndash; with more than 25,000 rural house planning permission granted in last 5 years.  In the same period, more than 90% of that number of rural homes were built, comprising around one in three houses completed in Ireland between 2016 and 2020.</p></reply>

If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list. Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support.  </p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. </p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental. </p>  <p>  In relation to affordable measures, the Affordable Housing Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, one of the aforementioned provisions. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home, much sooner than would otherwise be the case, by bridging the gap between what people have and the price of the new home they want, while also building confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply. </p>  <p>  Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and significant feedback has been factored in. Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year. </p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p>  <p>  An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, &euro;310 million was made available to service local authority land for the delivery of affordable housing under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The SSF provides for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent. This fund sub-vents the cost of facilitating infrastructure, with a current maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per affordable home. This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.  On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure.  </p>  <p>  To date, funding support of &euro;200 million has been allocated to enable delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or rent. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021.</p></reply>

These provisions are set out in the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 and link the State funding of political parties in the electoral Acts to the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection at D&aacute;il general elections.  To receive full State funding under the electoral Acts, a qualified political party must have at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the election. This will rise to 40% in 2023.</p>  <p>  The impact of the gender provisions at the 2016 general election was that 163 women contested the election, representing 30% of the 551 candidates.  This was a significant increase over the 2011 general election, where only 15% of the candidates were women.  In 2016, 35 women were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This represents 22% of the total membership, compared with 15% in 2011.  At the 2020 general election 162 women contested the election, representing 31% of the 531 candidates.  This represents a slight increase in percentage terms (1%) over the 2016 general election.  36 women were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2020 representing 23% of the total membership, again representing a 1% increase over the 2016 general election.</p>  <p>  Funding received by qualified parties under the Electoral Acts can be used for the promotion of participation by women and young persons in political activity.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in recognition of the need to promote gender equality in local government, also introduced a funding scheme in March 2019 to incentivise political parties to increase the number of women candidates in the 2019 local elections. The scheme was open to all political parties on the Register of Political Parties on an opt-in basis.  The funding provided was an annual grant to political parties, based on their performance in fielding women candidates in the 2019 local elections.  This funding was to be used by the parties specifically for the purposes of promoting gender balance and diversity among the party&rsquo;s candidates and elected representatives. Examples of such activities could include the training of women candidates and the recruitment of diversity officers whose role would be to build the diversity of party membership and future local election candidates. </p>  <p>Since the introduction of the scheme in 2019, nine political parties have applied for funding. Following engagement with a number of political parties and key stakeholders, the scheme has been reviewed and now includes suggested activities and measurables.  This new scheme is open to all registered political parties and in the interests of inclusivity, to official representative groups of Independents.  The deadline for receipt of applications under the new scheme is 25   June 2021</p>  <p>  My Department also supports organisations such as the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, Women for Election and Longford Women&rsquo;s Link.  These organisations work with women in a non-partisan way, providing key capacity building services for all women interested in local government.  My Department also continues to support local authorities in their endeavours to encourage the participation of women and wider diversity in local government.  In 2019 and 2020, funding was provided to local authority initiatives for projects which included building general awareness of local government and participation in local decision-making structures, particularly among women, minority and diverse communities.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Government approved a significant reform of the remuneration of local authority elected members.  It also noted the work of local government stakeholders in agreeing an Action Plan to implement a range of non-pay related reforms, including issues such as maternity leave, administrative supports and professional development for councillors. These reforms, taken together with the pay reforms approved, will make the role of councillor more sustainable and manageable, facilitating a cohort of members representative and fully reflective of the diverse communities where they are elected. </p></reply>

The Affordable Housing Bill 2020 will ensure that affordability is put at the heart of the housing system and will underpin the new local authority led scheme of affordable homes for purchase, an Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme (private lands) and, for renters in Co. Galway and all over Ireland, the introduction of a new national Cost Rental scheme.</p>  <p>  This year will also see the first ever cost rental units, more than 400 units, built and occupied in the State. Cost rental is targeted at moderate income households where the rent charged only covers the cost of provision of homes. The Land Development Agency will be put on a statutory footing and given capital to ramp up cost rental provision to the scale needed in counties such as Galway. </p>  <p>  The Government has, and continues to, put in place enhanced legislative protections for renters during the pandemic. There are targeted protections for renters with evictions bans in place during periods of restricted movement and protections for renters whose income has been impacted by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Building on the urgent Covid-19 rental measures to date, the Government plans through the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 to  extend by a further 6 months until 12 January 2022,  the targeted protections under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 for those tenants whose income has been impacted by Covid-19 resulting in rent arrears and the risk of tenancy termination.</p>  <p>  Low-income tenants are disproportionately employed in sectors that have been severely affected by Covid-19 restrictions. Significant State income supports are available to assist tenants to pay their rent including changes to the Rent Supplement eligibility rules for tenants whose income has been reduced because of Covid-19.</p>  <p>For any tenants impacted by rent arrears, my Department has published a guidance document, Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 - Guidance for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out the enhanced rental protections for tenants and landlords dealing with rent arrears that succeeded those provided under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and provides details on the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords.  The document is available on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie  .</p>  <p>  The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and the safety of gas, oil and electrical supply. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  On 1 July 2019, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 expanded the role of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in certain breaches of the law, defined in the Schedule 2 of the Residential Tenancies Acts as Improper Conduct. The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit of the RTB can investigate include: failure to comply with RPZ requirements; failure to register a tenancy; a reason given on a notice of termination that is known to be false or misleading; and failure to offer a tenant their tenancy back when certain conditions have been met. The RTB also has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - 'Our Shared Future', commits to improve the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing Residential Tenancies Board enforcement and examining incentives for long-term leasing.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2020 also includes provision to restrict the amount of money required to be paid as any advance rent payment and/or a deposit to secure a tenancy and limits regular advance rent payment to cover no more than 1 month's rent. </p>  <p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keep the operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 under constant review and any necessary legislation will be progressed without delay to help provide long term security of tenure for tenants at affordable rents.</p></reply>

If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.   </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted.</p>  <p>  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  In considering this issue, the Department is conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  My Department keeps HAP rent limits under constant review, as well as the use of discretion by local authorities. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department issued Circular Letter PL 03/2021 on 8 March 2021 requesting the submission of a  progress report on the collection of the levy by each local authority. A response has now been received from each of the 31 local authorities.  My Department is currently assessing the responses received and intends to proactively engage with individual local authorities as necessary and identify any issues to be addressed.

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 confers significant powers upon local authorities, including requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Site Levy and the Vacant Site Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. These levies are applied annually for as long as relevant sites remain derelict or vacant. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.</p>  <p>  While the legislation is kept under regular review, there are no plans to amend the legislation at this point in time.</p></reply>

All private landlords, Approved Housing Bodies and providers of Student Specific Accommodation are required to register their tenancies with the RTB. Managing the registration of tenancies is a core function of the RTB. This allows the RTB to collect and provide definitive data on the rental sector and for transparency across the rental sector through the public register of tenancies; thus, enabling a better understanding of the sector.</p>  <p>  Non-compliance with the requirement to register a tenancy is dealt with by two processes in the RTB, the Registration Enforcement Process or the Investigations and Sanctions Process.</p>  <p>  The RTB has registration enforcement powers to pursue landlords who have not complied with their obligation to register their tenancies. Failure to register is an offence which may result in a criminal conviction, a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. The RTB makes every effort to inform landlords of their obligations to register and legal action is taken as a last resort. The RTB, receives information from different sources regarding whether a tenancy is registered or not, including local authorities, members of the public, RTB checks and follow-ups and the Department of Social Protection. The RTB writes to landlords directly and gives them opportunities to comply before legal action is taken. The majority of landlords who are contacted are already complying with their obligation or then comply with their obligation to register which halts any requirement for the formal enforcement process. However, in a small number of cases formal notices and Solicitor Letters must be issued.</p>  <p>  The RTB has an Investigations and Sanctions unit dedicated to investigating certain potential breaches of rental law by a landlord referred to as improper conduct under Schedule 2 to the Acts. One of the breaches that can be investigated is a failure to register a tenancy with the RTB within one month of the tenancy commencing. The Investigations and Sanctions Unit can start an investigation either as a result of information received from members of the public or as a result of information gathered from records that the RTB has access to under the Residential Tenancies Acts. If a landlord is found to have engaged in improper conduct, a sanction may be imposed on them by an independent Decision maker which may comprise on or all of the following - a written caution, a monetary sanction of &euro;15,000 and &euro;15,000 in costs.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution.

The Circular advises that the PUP payment should be considered as temporary in the overall context of an applicant household's income. In this regard, when assessing a household, the household&rsquo;s income immediately prior to receipt of the PUP should be considered by the authority. Based on all of the available income information, the authority must then make a decision as to whether the household meets the income criteria. </p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

The Irish and UK Governments also set out their own respective commitments.</p>  <p>  The Government has remained focussed on implementing these important commitments. They are reflected in our Programme for Government, which ensures that their delivery is at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s work.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the Government established a Shared Island Initiative and Shared Island Fund, which provides &euro;500m for capital investment over the next five years. This funding is ring-fenced for collaborative North/South investment, and emphasises our commitment to mutually beneficial North-South cooperation on new and existing projects, as set out in the NDNA agreement.</p>  <p>  Projects such as the Ulster Canal and the reviews of rail and air connectivity are being progressed, as is work relating to the development of Greenways including the cross-border Sligo-Enniskillen Greenway.</p>  <p>  We will work with the Executive and the UK Government on commitments regarding third-level opportunities for young people, from across the North West, at the Ulster University Magee Campus in Derry. Proposals for the establishment of All-Island Research Centres are also being discussed.</p>  <p>  Projects such as the Narrow Water Bridge and potential investment in research and innovation, continue to be developed, and announcements regarding these are expected this summer.</p>  <p>  The Government has also made budgetary provisions to deliver on the language and culture commitments we made as a Government to support Irish language broadcasting, community groups, and the development of Irish language networks.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s expanded Reconciliation Fund, along with the International Fund for Ireland and the new PEACE PLUS programme for Northern Ireland and the Border counties, will provide critical funding for work on peace and reconciliation.</p>  <p>  The first NDNA Implementation Review Meeting took place virtually on 11 January 2021. I attended together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, First Minister and deputy First Minister, and the leaders of the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. At this meeting, we affirmed our shared commitment to the ongoing implementation of the NDNA agreement.</p></reply>

I welcomed the ceasefire which came into effect on 21 May and encourage all efforts to ensure that it holds. </p>  <p>  Tensions in the region are still high. There is a responsibility on all parties to ensure that the ceasefire is respected and to avoid all unilateral actions which can increase tension. The international community bears a responsibility to support the ceasefire and to encourage the parties towards a return to political engagement. I am committed to that effort and have been in regular contact with key counterparts in the region, and in Europe and the US, to that end. </p>  <p>  Recent violence has had a serious impact on an already difficult humanitarian situation and in this context I announced on 19 May that Ireland would provide &euro;1.5 million in emergency humanitarian support for the occupied Palestinian territory through UNRWA and UNICEF.</p>  <p>  The events which took place in May happened in a context of settlement expansion and ongoing threats of evictions. Ireland remains committed to a negotiated Two-State solution based on international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to raise our issues of concern with Israel at both political and official levels, bilaterally and in multilateral fora. These include the serious issues of unnecessary demolitions, settlement expansion and evictions. </p>  <p>  Ireland supported emergency sessions of the UN Security Council on this issue. We will continue to use our seat on the Council to stress the importance of these issues to Ireland, including at the meeting of the Council later today. In my address to the Council on 16 May, I emphasised the obligations that all sides have under international humanitarian law. These obligations must also be remembered in the context of the ceasefire.</p>  <p>  I will continue to highlight this issue at the UN and through the EU, and support international efforts to ensuring the current ceasefire holds. In this respect, I also want to underline Ireland&rsquo;s full support for the efforts of UN Special Co-ordinator on the Middle East, Tor Wennesland.</p></reply>

The Government announced on 28 May that subject to the prevailing epidemiological situation, international travel will resume on 19 July. </p>  <p>  The EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC), previously called the Digital Green Certificate, is intended to facilitate freedom of movement across the EU and to allow for the progressive lifting, in a coordinated way, of travel restrictions, subject to prevailing medical and scientific advice in each Member State. The Regulation is expected to come into force on July 1. All Member States will have a six-week phasing in period in order to become compliant with the Regulation. The new Certificate will not become a pre-condition to free movement across the EU. Persons travelling without a EUDCC can still travel, but may be subject to limitations such as enhanced testing, quarantine or self-isolation.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach has established a group, involving a broad range of Departments, in relation to this proposal. The Department of Health is working on the required legal instruments. On the Certificate itself, the HSE. in cooperation with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is developing the IT and required operational procedures. </p>  <p>  From 19 July, Ireland will broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries (outside EU/EAA). To protect citizens against the importation of variants, an &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be co-ordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest.</p></reply>

Ireland is proud to be among the top OECD DAC donors in targeting gender equality. In 2019, 76% of our ODA contributed to gender equality and we expect this figure to be similar for 2020 and 2021.  The Irish Aid annual report for 2019, published last autumn, had a spotlight on Ireland's support for gender equality and is available on the Irish Aid website.</p>  <p>  All organisations which receive funding from Irish Aid are asked to demonstrate how they are addressing gender equality through the activities being supported. Within the OECD, Ireland's aid programme is one of the strongest supporter of civil society organisations.  Many civil society organisations in receipt of Irish Aid funding advocate for women's rights, as well as rights of LGBT+ people. The full articulation of such rights has in many jurisdictions been under particular strain during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  I attach importance to the advocacy role played by civil society organisations in many of our partner countries. Ireland is proud to promote free speech and active policy debate, as a marker of a healthy democracy.</p></reply>

These challenges involve particularly rule of law but also more recently LGBTQI+ rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a firm supporter of the values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. </p>  <p>  As I said earlier, I am particularly concerned about recent changes to Hungary&rsquo;s laws. The potential for the Bill recently passed by the Hungarian Assembly to harm the rights and freedoms of the LGBTQI+ community in Hungary, particularly young people, is extremely worrying.  The Government has made known its clear views on these developments, including at the EU's General Affairs Council.  The Embassy of Ireland in Hungary has also actively supported statements made locally by like-minded partners and has registered deep concern about this law and its implications for equality and human rights</p>  <p>  The Multiannual Financial Framework and Recovery Fund 2021-2027 package, finalised unanimously last December, requires Member States allocated funding from the EU budget to respect the rule of law. Although it is regrettable that Hungary and Poland have since felt that a legal challenge to this Regulation is necessary, they are within their rights to do so. However, Ireland strongly believe this Regulation is fair and proportionate and plans to intervene in support of the Council in these proceedings. </p>  <p>  In 2020, the European Commission introduced a new Annual Rule of Law Report process that offers an impartial assessment of the rule of law situation in each Member State. The Hungary chapter of the 2020 Report highlighted a number of concerns regarding judicial independence and anti-corruption.</p>  <p>  As part of the Article 7 process, there have been a number of hearings in relation to Hungary and EU values at the General Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to urge Hungary to engage constructively with the Commission and Member States and to address the concerns raised by its EU partners.</p></reply>

I have written to Israel&rsquo;s new Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid and I look forward to having the chance to speak with him in due course on a range of issues.  </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s High Representative has spoken to Foreign Minister Lapid. I participated in a discussion on the Middle East at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, 21 June. At this meeting I supported early engagement with the new Government by the EU. The relationship between Israel and the EU is important and we hope to have an opportunity to meet with Minister Lapid at a Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months. </p>  <p>  At the FAC I also supported EU engagement in a reinvigorated role for the Middle East Quartet and for the role of the EU's Special Representative on the Middle East Peace Process, including in engaging with the new Israeli Government. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship with Israel is important and valued across a range of issues. I have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have clearly outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Middle East Peace Process during these visits and will continue to do so. During the escalation in violence last month, I discussed the conflict with the Israeli Ambassador; in particular on the issue of compliance with international humanitarian law. These messages are important, as is our channel of communication with the Israeli Government.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated Two-State solution based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.</p></reply>

However, as I have stated before, ease of travel is vital to our economic relationships and for building connections across the Atlantic. We continue our work to ensure that the restrictions will not have any long-term impact on existing channels of migration, exchange, education and tourism, which benefit our countries significantly.</p>  <p>  We have raised the issues associated with the ongoing US travel restrictions, including the question of resumption of travel between our two countries, in our contacts with the US Administration - most recently, during my meeting with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan in May. We agreed that it is important that we restore connectivity with the US as soon as it is feasible, and safe, to do so. </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C is also engaging closely with other contacts in the Administration, and with the US Department of State on these matters, urging them to ease the restrictions, where appropriate. Our Ambassador has written to them to raise the issue of processing National Interest Exemptions for economic reasons to assist Irish companies travelling to the US. Together with other EU countries, we have also written to US Secretary of State Blinken requesting reconsideration of the US travel restrictions currently in place. </p>  <p>  My Department has a very positive working relationship with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin. Although US immigration regulation is a matter for the US authorities, my Department has continued to encourage the US Embassy to maintain the processing of exemptions to their travel restrictions for those travelling to the US for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  We are particularly keen that the current travel restrictions will not negatively impact the future of the J1 and Working Holiday Agreement programmes. I look forward to working actively with the US again to promote travel between our countries.</p></reply>

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish, and does nothing to tackle the public health, security or economic issues faced by the people of Myanmar. I have called upon the Myanmar military to demonstrate restraint, respect human rights and the rule of law, immediately release political detainees and restore legitimate civilian government. </p>  <p>  In my statements, I have emphasised the importance of a united response to this crisis, in particular, we need to recognise the importance of engaging partners in the region to ensure an effective, appropriate, and sustainable outcome to the crisis. Ireland has been active in supporting similar statements from the EU and notably from the Security Council.  </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes and supports the diplomatic efforts of ASEAN. I appreciate the sensitivity and complexity of the situation. However, the promise of their Leaders&rsquo; Summit and the five-point consensus has yet to be fulfilled and I encourage ASEAN and its members to be resolute in finding a path forwards. </p>  <p>  Ireland repeated our call for the urgent, full implementation of the ASEAN Consensus most recently at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Monday and in the closed consultation of the United Nations Security Council regarding Myanmar last Friday.  </p>  <p>  Ireland was also a member of the core group for the Resolution that was comprehensively adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Friday last, which called on the Myanmar armed forces to engage with ASEAN constructively with a view to realising an inclusive and peaceful dialogue among all stakeholders in the country.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to be concerned that Myanmar may well be facing a period of protracted repression, conflict and instability. I share those concerns and Ireland will continue to work actively to use our influence with partners and through our positions within the EU and the UN Security Council to promote the rule of law and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

It is no coincidence that of the 15 countries most susceptible to climate risks, 8 host a UN peacekeeping operation or a special political mission.</p>  <p>  As a result, we have prioritised the issue of climate change through our membership of the UN Security Council. We are doing this in a number of ways.</p>  <p>  First, we have taken up the role of co-chair of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security along with Niger. As co-chair we are working to ensure that members of the Council have access to the latest analysis and research on climate related security risks. This is important to build our collective understanding of how climate change contributes to insecurity but also how climate action can help build peace. The strengthening of knowledge in this way is part of our efforts to build consensus across Security Council members on the importance of the Council robustly tackling this issue as part of its mandate.</p>  <p>  Secondly and relatedly, we are working to advance the inclusion of climate in UN Security Council mandates and resolutions where it makes sense to do so. This includes, for example, the provision for comprehensive risk assessments and risk management strategies in peacekeeping mandate renewals where relevant.

Recent hostilities have caused severe damage to infrastructure and the humanitarian consequences have been devastating for a community already enduring both a blockade and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to local authorities, more than 2000 housing units were damaged or destroyed and essential services, including water, sanitation and health systems, adversely affected.  </p>  <p>  In light of this situation, on 19 May my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney TD announced that Ireland would provide &euro;1.5 million in emergency humanitarian support for the occupied Palestinian territory. This includes &euro;500,000 to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) for the provision of medical and sanitation services to thousands of children in acute need, and &euro;1 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for emergency food, water and sanitation supplies. Ireland is also addressing a critical infrastructure gap by funding the development of a solar energy plant which will power the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment Plant, reducing the strain on Gaza&rsquo;s electricity grid.</p>  <p>  The rebuilding of Gaza and restoration of essential infrastructure such as water, sewage and electricity will require an integrated approach, which will include determining the part which the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism will play into the future. A Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment is presently being carried out by the United Nations, European Union and World Bank.  Decisions on further Irish Aid support for reconstruction, including the use of new or established mechanisms, will be influenced by the outcome of that study.  Irish officials continue to be engaged on this issue on the ground.</p>  <p>  However, the roots of the problems in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. Ireland has consistently called for the lifting of the blockade so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume. We will continue to make every effort to ensure that the situation in Gaza remains high on the international agenda.</p></reply>

Fundamentally, Ireland believes that the embargo serves no constructive purpose and that its lifting would facilitate an opening of Cuba&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people. Ireland, along with our EU partners, has been a consistent supporter of the annual Resolution put forward by Cuba at the UN General Assembly regarding the US economic blockade, and I can confirm that Ireland again voted in favour of this Resolution when it was brought before the General Assembly yesterday, 23 June. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department closely follow developments relating to the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which is a US federal law that strengthens and continues the US economic embargo against Cuba. I was concerned by the decision taken in 2019 by the previous US Administration to suspend waivers for Title III of the Act, which had previously protected European persons and entities from its extra-territorial elements. Together with our EU partners, Ireland has firmly and continuously opposed extra-territorial measures that seek to extend the US embargo against Cuba to third countries, as contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.</p>  <p>  I also regret the inclusion of Cuba on the list of State-sponsors of terrorism by the previous US Administration and I support the statement by EU HR/VP Josep Borrell following the third EU-Cuba Joint Council in January 2021, that this decision will have a negative impact on foreign direct investment in Cuba and will further aggravate the already difficult situation of the Cuban people in the midst of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the lifting of the US embargo on Cuba and my officials, including at the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico which covers Cuba, will continue to monitor the situation closely, in liaison with our EU partners.</p></reply>

The Security Council met five times on the escalation of the conflict in the month of May. On 16 May I addressed the Council and called for the cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and humanitarian access, and emphasised the obligations that all sides have under international humanitarian law. I called on the UN Security Council to speak with one voice in clearly demanding an immediate end to violence. I welcomed the 21 May ceasefire and the UN Security Council press statement on the matter of 22 May. </p>  <p>  I discussed the conflict with the Israeli Ambassador on 11 May, in particular on the issue of compliance with international humanitarian law. </p>  <p>  During the escalation I was in contact with my counterparts across the Middle East region to support efforts to bring an end to the cycle of violence and to move to political engagement.  I want to acknowledge in particular the role played by Egypt in brokering a ceasefire. I discussed the situation with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Tony Blinken in Shannon on 24 May.  I had further discussions on the Middle East Peace Process with the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates during my visit to the Gulf on 15 -17 June.</p>  <p>  I joined EU Foreign Affairs Ministers at an extraordinary meeting on the conflict on 18 May where there was a clear call for an immediate ceasefire. At the recent meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers on 21 June, I underlined support for EU engagement in a reinvigorated role for the Middle East Quartet and for the role of the EU's Special Representative on the Middle East Peace Process.  </p>  <p>  I have stressed that the immediate focus must be on getting vital humanitarian assistance to those who need it. Ireland has stepped up in this respect; on 19 May I announced an additional &euro;1.5m in emergency support to UNRWA and UNICEF in response to emergency appeals.  </p>  <p>  The events of the past month have not happened in isolation. They are taking place in the context of unabated settlement expansion and ongoing threats of evictions and violence against Palestinians. Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated Two-State solution based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions and agreed parameters. I support the role of the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process in this regard. Ireland will participate in consultations with Mr Wennesland along with other UN Security Council Members later today.</p></reply>

Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The European Commission published its latest Annual Enlargement Package and country reports in October 2020. The country reports for 2020 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made limited progress.</p>  <p>  Inter-Governmental Conferences ("IGCs") with Serbia and Montenegro will take place on 22 June. The EU Common Positions will be presented at the IGCs, followed by a political discussion between EU MS and Serbia and Montenegro at each respective meeting which will focus on the pace of reform. The IGCs will be the first held under the new enhanced accession methodology. </p>  <p>  The IGCs are important to maintain momentum and to ensure focus on those areas in which progress is lacking, so that both Serbia and Montenegro can progress on their EU paths. In the case of Serbia, while it has not proved possible to open chapters/clusters at this IGC given the lack of sufficient progress on the rule of law, we hope that Serbia will make further progress over the coming months to allow for the opening of clusters at the next IGC. While Montenegro has opened all chapters, concerns remain around the slow pace of reform on the rule of law in particular.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains concerned with the consistently slow progress in both countries in regard to reforms on the fundamentals (rule of law, freedom of expression). It is ultimately the responsibility of the countries themselves to clearly demonstrate that they have the political will to follow through on commitments made concerning the acceleration of their reform efforts. It is also crucial that Serbia takes the opportunity to make progress in the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, aimed at achieving a comprehensive resolution of all issues between Kosovo and Serbia, which resumed in Brussels on 15 June. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been, and remains, a steadfast supporter of EU Enlargement and believes that EU accession is central to ensuring stability and peace in the Western Balkans.</p></reply>

Under UNITAD's terms of reference, it is required to implement its mandate according to UN best practices, meaning that no evidence may be shared for criminal proceedings in which capital punishment may be imposed. There are ongoing efforts to establish arrangements for the sharing of evidence with competent Iraqi authorities in accordance with UNITAD's terms of reference, and we encourage progress in these efforts.</p></reply>

I firmly believe that universal and equitable access to safe, effective, and affordable diagnostics, treatments and vaccines is crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.  I am determined that Ireland, in particular the Irish Aid programme, plays its full part in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with an emphasis on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable. The Government has shown support for sharing COVID-19 related knowledge and research outputs in a number of ways. This includes engagement in the National Open Research Forum, and the granting of non-exclusive royalty-free licenses through Knowledge Transfer Ireland. It also includes Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s alignment with Plan S, an initiative to ensure publicly funded research is openly available, immediately, without embargo for the betterment of societal needs.</p>  <p>  Overall, in 2021, the Department of Foreign Affairs through Irish Aid has allocated some &euro;100 million to global health, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes a &euro;4 million donation to COVAX, the vaccine sharing mechanism so far, accompanied by  &euro;1 million to WHO to support their oversight of the response. It also includes support through Irish Embassies abroad to help partner countries manage the pandemic, and direct support provided to countries such as Nepal, and India, in partnership with the HSE. </p>  <p>  Discussions are underway at the WTO on proposals for a waiver on intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines. The Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment leads on Intellectual Property Rights and World Trade Organisation (WTO) matters, including on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement. While it is important to provide access to technologies for production of vaccines, there are other obstacles to rapid scale-up of production, including production capacity, and availability of know-how.  My officials will continue to engage with their colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as they work with the European Commission and other Member States on the EU position on the TRIPS waiver. </p>  <p>  Consideration is also being given to Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in technology-pooling mechanisms such as the Covid Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) initiative. My Department continues to liaise with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-24a.291.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062400074#WRF03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 136, 151 and 154 together.</p>  <p>  The Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement. It was jointly negotiated, and jointly agreed, by the EU and the UK &ndash; the result of a painstaking process which took more than four years, during which a whole host of options were explored. Ultimately, the Protocol was - and is - the only solution found to the problems caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the Protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set down in the Good Friday Agreement. The Protocol prevents a hard border on this island and protects the gains of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  As a jointly negotiated agreement, it now needs to be jointly implemented, in good faith. There are undoubtedly challenges. Earlier this month, the Joint Committee &ndash; the proper forum for discussion regarding implementation &ndash; came together to take stock of progress to date and give consideration to the identified issues of concern. EU and UK officials continue to work on developing solutions to these outstanding issues. It is important that process continue and be encouraged.</p>  <p>  Working together like this is the only path to sustainable solutions. Unilateral actions on sensitive issues in Northern Ireland never work. UK unilateral actions taken to date have damaged trust. The UK and EU must work together to find pragmatic solutions. In that regard I am encouraged by the decision of the UK Government to seek EU agreement on extending the grace period on chilled meat products. Vice President &Scaron;efcovic, speaking last Friday in Bruges, welcomed this request, which is currently being assessed. Requesting the extension recognises that the Protocol is jointly owned and is to be jointly implemented. </p>  <p>  The European Union continues to show that it is a willing partner. The UK must show its willingness by honouring the commitments to which it has already signed up, which it negotiated, agreed, campaigned on, and ratified through its parliament. </p>  <p>  There are options to reduce the burden on businesses. An SPS agreement, even on a temporary basis, would offer a clear win and has broad support in Northern Ireland. This could reduce the level of checks on agri-food products travelling from GB to NI by up to 80% - this is a prize worth fighting for. US interlocutors have been clear that such an agreement would not stand in the way of a UK-US trade deal. People right across the political, business, retail, and farming sectors in Northern Ireland have made clear that they favour such an agreement. The EU Commission has said it could be put in place within weeks. It would be a simple, concrete and popular step. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the politics of Brexit are proving to be corrosive to the already very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland, polarising opinion and increasing tensions. I want us to get to a place where the implementation of the Protocol is fully realised in a way that works for Northern Ireland. We all have a responsibility to listen to the concerns and engage with citizens, businesses, politicians and community leaders in the North. </p>  <p>  There is also an onus on leaders and politicians to engage openly and honestly with citizens, businesses, politicians, and community leaders to explain the context of the Protocol - and to be clear and honest that the alternative to the Protocol is not life as it was before Brexit, but a scenario of much deeper and more difficult disruption. </p>  <p>  There is no easy alternative to the problems caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland. We spent four years exploring other options without success.  While Brexit has inevitably meant change for businesses, and sometimes difficult change, there are also significant potential opportunities for Northern Ireland through the Protocol, with open access to the rest of the UK internal market and to the entire EU Single Market of more than 450 million people. </p>  <p>  There is evidence of increased interest in Northern Ireland as an investment location - but stability and certainty are needed to help realise that potential. I will continue to do all I can to encourage pragmatic engagement on the implementation of the Protocol and to underpin peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

The latter is referred to as the British-Irish Agreement and it is an international Agreement which has been registered with the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Under the British-Irish Agreement, the two Governments affirmed their solemn commitment to support, and where appropriate implement, the provisions of the Multi-Party Agreement. Reflecting that solemn commitment, successive Irish and British Governments have worked together in partnership over the last 20 years - and continue to do so today - to secure the progressive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the consolidation of peace, increasing prosperity and furthering of reconciliation across these neighbouring islands, which the Agreement has enabled.</p>  <p>  The Government looks forward to the continuation of the partnership approach with the British Government as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, so as to secure the effective operation of all of the institutions and the full implementation of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. It was reached collectively, by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations. A key component of the framework is the establishment of an Independent Commission for Information Recovery (ICIR). In 2015, the two Governments concluded an international treaty on the ICIR, which will operate on an all-island basis and enable victims&rsquo; families to seek and receive information  about the circumstances of the deaths of their loved ones.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we make progress with respect to addressing legacy, for the victims and families who have been waiting for so long, and for society as a whole as we seek to build deeper reconciliation. The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p>  <p>  Where the British Government are proposing significant changes to that framework, we have made clear that these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  The Government remains ready to engage and work with the British Government and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive with a view to reaffirming a collective approach that is consistent with the Stormont House Agreement.</p></reply>

The new Strategy to implement this, &lsquo;A Career for EU&rsquo;, was approved by Government at the beginning of May and subsequently launched by the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, TD on 6 May 2021.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland faces a &lsquo;demographic cliff&rsquo; in its representation among the staff of the EU&rsquo;s Institutions, as senior Irish officials retire. At the same time, there are fewer Irish citizens entering into the system at junior grades. The new strategy is intended to address these issues, including with the aim of having 50 Irish citizens to have succeeded in gaining permanent positions in the EU Institutions by 2030.</p><p>The new strategy builds upon existing work presently carried out by my Department in promoting careers in the EU and includes a wide range of actions to significantly increase the numbers of Irish officials in both permanent and temporary positions within the EU Institutions over the coming years.</p><p>1. Increased promotion and outreach regarding EU career opportunities, including traineeships, to second and third-level students.</p><p>2. Providing more tailored support and training to Irish candidates applying for posts in the EU Institutions.</p><p>3. Providing additional resources dedicated to supporting the use of Irish as an official EU language, including by making training material available in Irish.</p><p>4. Increasing the funding of the Centrally Funded Scheme for Seconded National Experts to more than double, to 50, the number of civil servants seconded annually to the EU Institutions. </p><p>1. Expanding the current post-graduate scholarship programme, to enable at least 10 Irish students to study at the College of Europe in Bruges and Natolin.</p><p>2. Creating a stream within the Irish civil service for EU specialists, who will be assisted in applying for posts in the EU Institutions.</p><p>The implementation programme has commenced.  For example, Minister Byrne has met with careers services representatives from Third Level institutions, while a webinar on language careers in the EU is being organised by the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU. </p><p>I would encourage that those interested in careers in the EU institutions to consult my Department&rsquo;s website www.dfa.ie/eujobsfor more information.</p></reply>

At the most recent EU-Bahrain Human Rights Dialogue in February 2021, issues of concern raised by the EU included prison conditions and the impact of Covid-19 on human rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the EU&rsquo;s new Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, established in December 2020. The Regime provides the EU with a concrete tool to target those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses, wherever they might occur, including in States not currently subject to a specific sanctions regime. To date, sanctions have been imposed on a broad list of individuals and entities involved in human rights abuses, drawn from six different jurisdictions; China, Russia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Libya and DPRK.</p>  <p>  These designations send a strong message that the promotion and protection of human rights are a priority of EU external action. The EU is willing to act tangibly and directly to confront serious human rights violations, when other tools have not brought about the desired change of behaviour.</p></reply>

When Yemen was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 May, EU Member States were in agreement that there is no military solution to the conflict in Yemen and all parties should agree to an immediate ceasefire. </p>  <p>  As part of our role on the Security Council, Ireland is maintaining a very high level of engagement on Yemen with key parties in the region.

Relations with Russia will also form part of the discussions at the European Council taking place on 24/25 June, where An Taoiseach and his counterparts will discuss the EU's approach to the strategic relationship with our largest neighbour. This follows a substantive discussion on this strategic relationship at the European Council on 24 May.</p><p>On 16 June, High Representative Josep Borrell presented a Joint Communication on EU-Russia relations. The Communication recognises that the relationship has deteriorated since 2014. There was also clear acknowledgement our policy towards Russia continues to be guided by the following five principles, first agreed in 2016: </p><p>1.  full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements in relation to the conflict in Ukraine as key to any substantial change in the relationship; </p><p>2.  closer ties with Russia&rsquo;s former Soviet neighbours; </p><p>3.  strengthening EU resilience to Russian threats; </p><p>4.  selective engagement with Russia where this is clearly in the EU&rsquo;s interest; </p><p>5.  increased support for people-to-people contacts and for Russian civil society as a whole.</p><p>Ireland has made our concern about the imprisonment of Alexei Navalny very clear and we continue to call for his release. We have also raised concerns around human rights abuses in Russia and we will continue to do so. </p><p>It is important to remain open to areas where the EU can have constructive engagement with Russia on issues of strategic importance to us, while adhering to the five principles. In this regard, Ireland supports the strengthening of people-to-people contacts, engagement with Russia on global issues of concern, including Climate Security, and continued support to Russian civil society and human rights defenders.</p></reply>

A fourth package of targeted sanctions against 78 individuals and 8 entities was adopted, targeting those behind the repression, those responsible for the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk and several prominent business figures, who support and benefit from the Lukashenko regime. Ministers have also agreed on sectors to be targeted by the economic sanctions and work is underway to implement that agreement.  </p>  <p>  By these actions we are sending a strong signal to those supporting this regime - their continuous support for Lukashenko comes at a substantial cost. At the same time, Ireland and the EU stand ready to support a peaceful, democratic transition. This is why the European Commission has prepared a very ambitious comprehensive plan of up to &euro;3bn in economic support for a democratic Belarus.</p>  <p>  We will continue monitoring closely developments in Belarus and the EU will not shy away from taking further action in the near future including on other economic actors and sectors if the situation in Belarus does not improve.</p></reply>

It is vital that credible, transparent and inclusive elections are held in Nicaragua, as elsewhere, free from interference and in line with international standards.</p>  <p>  The recent adoption of legislation in Nicaragua such as the Foreign Agents Registration Law and the Special Law on Cybercrime is also a cause for concern. These laws serve to tighten restrictions on civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms in Nicaragua and hinder the work of civil society and non-governmental organisations.</p>  <p>  I fully support EU High Representative / Vice-President Josep Borrell's statement of 10 June 2021 on the situation in Nicaragua and echo his call for the immediate and unconditional release of the detained potential Presidential candidates and all other political prisoners, ensuring respect for their human, civil and political rights. Inclusive dialogue is the only way to resolve the political, economic and social crisis in Nicaragua. I also urge the Government of Nicaragua to authorise the return of international human rights bodies to the country, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to support efforts towards reaching a peaceful and negotiated solution in Nicaragua. Officials in my Department, including the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico which covers Nicaragua, will continue to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the EU Delegation to Nicaragua.</p></reply>

As outlined in the Programme for Government, its full implementation is an important priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government commitments that were made at the time of the NDNA are focused on working with the Executive through the NSMC to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. The first implementation review meeting took place in January of this year, which I attended with representatives of the British Government and the Executive. We reaffirmed our shared commitment to ensuring the sustainable and effective operation of all the devolved institutions, and to the ongoing implementation of NDNA.  </p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Secretary of State last week gave an assurance that the positive measures agreed in support of linguistic diversity and cultural expression in Northern Ireland will be put in place through legislation in Westminster in October in the event that this balanced cultural package is not enacted through the Northern Ireland Assembly. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that we can arrange another implementation review meeting in the period ahead. </p>  <p>  The NSMC is essential to overseeing and developing North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, including the implementation of the NDNA Agreement. The important work of the NSMC to develop cooperation on an all-island basis has resumed following the NDNA agreement. Two successful NSMC plenary meetings have now taken place, as well as a number of Sectoral meetings at Ministerial level. It is regrettable that it was necessary to postpone the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council scheduled for 18 June, and we will seek to find an early date for that to be rescheduled.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work with both the UK Government and the Northern Irish Executive to ensure that the NDNA agreement is fully implemented to ensure the effective functioning of the Executive.</p></reply>

I trust that the Colombian authorities will fully investigate and bring those responsible for abuses or human rights violations, be they members of the security forces or other individuals, to justice. </p>  <p>  I note the recent statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, detailing reports of &ldquo;private individuals&rdquo; firing shots at protesters &ldquo;in the presence of police officers". I support Ms Bachelet's call for the end to all forms of violence, including vandalism, and for dialogue and the need to ensure respect for the life and dignity of all people. I remain deeply concerned at reports of disproportionate use of force by the police in Colombia against protestors and observers, as well as reports of attacks on the police  and police infrastructure. The Embassy of Ireland in Colombia supports and works closely with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia and Ireland contributes to the core budget for their important work.</p>  <p>  I echo the message of EU High Representative/Vice-President Borrell following his call with President Duque of Colombia on 22 May 2021, that the solution to the current crisis should be reached through inclusive dialogue and negotiation. In that vein, EU Special Representative for Human Rights and EU Special Envoy for the Peace Process in Colombia, Eamon Gilmore, conducted a high-level visit to Colombia last week to discuss the situation. I hope that progress can be made in the period ahead on negotiations on a national dialogue. </p>  <p>  After decades of violence, Colombia needs to continue to strengthen the advances made on the path towards peace. Colombia&rsquo;s citizens deserve stability, safety and certainty, especially in view of the serious challenges the country is facing from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I would like to express again Ireland's solidarity with the Government and people of Colombia in facing these challenges in a peaceful, inclusive and constructive manner and in forging a consensus on dealing with them. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, including at the Embassy of Ireland in Colombia, will continue to closely monitor this complex and evolving situation.</p></reply>

Ireland is actively promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms in our engagement across the Security Council agenda. </p>  <p>  This includes country situations addressed by the Council, many of which involve serious human rights issues. I will mention just some of these today.</p>  <p>  In Council discussions on Myanmar last week, Ireland called on the international community to respond urgently to the crisis since the coup. We have consistently condemned the ongoing violence, including reports of abuse and harassment of women asserting their right to political participation. </p>  <p>  At the Council discussion on Haiti last week, Ireland reaffirmed the importance of credible, inclusive and transparent elections as a vital step towards restored and reinvigorated democratic institutions. In March, the Council agreed a presidential statement which called on the Haitian Government to respect freedom of expression and association and to hold free and fair legislative elections. </p>  <p>  At a Council meeting in May following the most recent coup in Mali, Ireland called for all parties to strictly comply with Mali&rsquo;s Transition Charter, for a return to constitutional order and for the holding of inclusive and democratic elections. </p>  <p>  The human rights situation in Belarus continues to be a matter of serious concern. At the Council meeting in May, following the coercive forced landing of a civil aircraft by the Belarusian authorities, we again condemned the increasing levels of repression and reaffirmed our unwavering support for a sustainable, democratic and peaceful resolution of the situation in Belarus. </p>  <p>  We engage openly with all Security Council members on the basis of our values. I regularly raise human rights issues in my discussions with Council members and other key partners. This is part of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to being an active and constructive Council member and complements our strong engagement at the Human Rights Council and in other multilateral human rights fora.</p></reply>

In particular, this includes addressing the situation of undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and working to secure legal pathways for Irish people who wish to live and work in the US. We have continued to raise these matters in our engagement with successive US Administrations, Members of US Congress and leaders from across the political spectrum. The Taoiseach raised the matter in March this year directly with President Biden during his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, work closely with Irish Immigration Centres, which support the needs of Irish citizens. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2020, over &euro;4.25m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for ESP and Covid-19 related projects.</p>  <p>  I am glad to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for the President as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. We will actively engage with the Administration and Congress, as they pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US, including through our Embassy in Washington DC. We also continue to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens and we will seek the reintroduction of the Bill to Congress at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

I emphasised the importance of allowing unrestricted access to the region to independent observers in order to make an objective assessment of the situation, particularly through the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland has raised concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang in multilateral fora on a number of occasions. Most recently, this week we supported a Joint Statement at the 47th session of the Human Rights Council, expressing our concern at the human rights situation in Xinjiang, and calling on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland also raised this issue  in our National Statement at the UN Human Rights Council in March this year, and supported a Joint Statement on the issue at the UN Third Committee on 6 October 2020.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and the Government will continue to monitor and assess the situation and engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

At this time I do not believe from our soundings on the ground that this support currently exists. A failed Resolution would set back progress on this important issue. The work of building support must continue.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to taking action in ways which are consistent with the proposed Resolution. In the short term, the revision of the European Union&rsquo;s Gas Directive and Gas Regulation provides an opportunity to build consensus within the EU, itself an important constituency for any work at the UN.  </p>  <p>  Separately, upcoming climate related events provide an opportunity to advance understanding of international dynamics around this proposal. Such events include the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy in September 2021, the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in October 2021 (COP15), the Conference of Parties to United National Framework Convention on Climate Change in November 2021 (COP26), the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (date TBC), and the United Nations Ocean Conference to be held in 2022.  This will complement Ireland's engagement on the Climate and Security agenda during our term on the Security Council. </p></reply>

A Strategic Partnership for Mutually Beneficial Co-operation was signed in 2012 and there are Memoranda of Understanding in relation to co-operation in a number of sectorial areas.</p>  <p>  Total trade between Ireland and China has increased significantly in recent years, amounting to approximately &euro;23 billion in 2019. So far in 2021 merchandise trade with China is up almost &euro;743m, when compared with the same period in 2020, reaching a total of &euro;5.55 billion. </p>  <p>  While we share strong links in a number of areas, there are nevertheless a number of areas of difference in our relationship. I believe it is important to also have constructive engagement in areas where we do not agree and in order to address areas of concern.</p>  <p>  I visited China in late May to meet with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. During this meeting we discussed an extensive agenda covering bilateral relations, EU-China relations as well as issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council. I also raised the issue of human rights, particularly in relation to Xinjiang, as well as the situation in Hong Kong. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with Chinese authorities both bilaterally and in multilateral fora to enhance our cooperation and also to raise issues of concern to us.</p></reply>

My Department does not promote one structure over another and the enterprise supports developed by the Department and its agencies are available to co-operatives where they meet the criteria for such supports. It is premature at this stage to speculate on how co-operatives could most appropriately be supported into the future and whether a dedicated development unit would be necessary. Should such a unit be considered, then its proposed functions would determine the number and skillsets of staff and associated grades and salary levels. My Department is prioritising the supports and assistance available to enterprises, including co-operatives, in the context of economic recovery and the challenges ahead including climate action and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  However, it is clear that the laws underpinning co-operatives are in need of reform and my Department is well advanced in the preparation of a general scheme of a Co-operative Societies Bill. This Bill will consolidate and modernise the existing Industrial and Provident Societies legislation and provide an effective and robust legislative framework for the diverse range of organisations using the co-operative model in Ireland, including worker co-operatives. The Bill will support the co-operative ethos and introduce new / expanded provisions across a range of areas including registration; corporate governance; compliance; financial reporting; and powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. This will provide co-operatives with a modern and fit for purpose legislative basis on a par with other legal structures such as companies.  </p>  <p>  In the context of enactment of the Co-operative Societies Bill, my Department intends to engage widely with stakeholders including the co-operative sector, professional advisers, development agencies, relevant Government departments etc. to raise awareness of the modernised legislative basis underpinning co-operatives as an attractive option for entities wishing to operate under the co-operative ethos.</p></reply>

At that point, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement&rsquo;s (ODCE) annual budget was &euro;5.057m.

As the Deputy will be aware, delays arose in progressing the legislation over that period, but with the finalisation of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Pre Legislative Scrutiny, I intend to revert to Cabinet shortly for the publication of the Bill which will establish the CEA. I would hope that the Bill could be enacted in the Autumn session paving the way for the establishment of the CEA next year.</p><p>The Department also sanctioned an additional 14 staff at civil service grades to the ODCE which would represent a 35% increase in such staff.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market. The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states. Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.</p>  <p>  In order to work in Ireland a non-EEA National, unless they are exempted, must hold a valid Employment Permit. All applications for employment permits are processed in line with the Employment Permits Acts and associated Regulations which lay down in legislation the criteria in relation to the application, grant and refusal of an employment permit.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Section of my Department inform me that, a number of issues were identified with regard to the employment permit renewal applications for both these named individuals. My officials are engaging directly with the company to outline the issues in question and assist them in clarifying the options available to them under the employment permit system.</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments.My Department outlined proposals for a new Micro-generation Support Scheme in a public consultation that closed on 18 February last. A summary report of the submissions received has now been published on my Department's website. Analysis of these submissions will help to inform the final scheme design, to be approved and announced in the coming months.</p><p>While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. Work is ongoing with a view to achieving transposition of the Directive into Irish law as soon as possible.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will publish a draft framework later this year which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee payment for exported renewable electricity, to give effect to the above-mentioned articles and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro-generators.</p></reply>

Likewise, if the loan to which the payment protection policy is attached, is fixed in duration for at least at five years and one month, the PPI policy is likely to be considered a &ldquo;long-term financial service&rdquo;. In these circumstances the Ombudsman may investigate a complaint where the conduct complaint of occurred during or after 2002, if the complaint is made within the time limits specified by the Act.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman is aware that the time limits governing complaints to the FSPO can be complex. For that reason, every complaint is examined individually by the FSPO, to establish whether it meets the eligibility criteria for investigation, laid down by the governing legislation. This includes a consideration, if a complaint does not otherwise meet the prescribed time limits, as to whether the Ombudsman should use his discretion to extend the time for the making of the complaint, on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to do so and it would be just and equitable in all of the circumstances.</p></reply>

This applies even if the EU has a Free Trade Agreement with the relevant third country.</p><p>In cases where it is applicable, the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration.</p><p>Vehicles originally exported from the EU to the UK which meet certain criteria may be eligible for Returned Goods Relief under the EU customs rules (the Union Customs Code).  Under Union Customs Code, goods can be exported from the EU to a third country and re-imported into the EU without payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief<b></b>are met. The goods must have been originally exported from the EU, must not have been altered and must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. In very specific circumstances, relief from VAT may also apply where the goods are re-imported into the EU by the same economic entity that originally exported the goods out of the EU.</p><p>Further information on Returned Goods Relief and Movement of Motor Vehicles including proofs required for claiming the relief is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p><p>On the matter of Vehicle Registration Tax, the UK exit from the EU has no impact on VRT liability. Buses generally fall within EU Categories M2 or M3 and, when registered in the State, these vehicles are liable to a VRT flat rate of &euro;200.</p><p>The Deputy is asking also about the potential for VAT recovery by businesses whose activities are exempt from VAT. The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT. In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that under Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rules, the supplier of passenger transport services does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and, consequently, has no VAT recovery entitlement on their input costs.</p><p>In accordance with the EU rules, Ireland may continue to apply this existing, historic VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport but, for as long as the exemption remains, the conditions under which the exemption was granted cannot be changed;  for example, Ireland could not adopt the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to introduce a new entitlement to VAT recovery on purchases of buses from Great Britain. In fact, the introduction of a new entitlement to VAT recovery for the passenger transport sector could only be done if Ireland were to decide to end its historic exemption for the sector, and bring passenger transport services into the VAT net;  this would then require suppliers to register for VAT and require them to charge VAT on their passenger fares.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that under the existing arrangements, certain reliefs from VAT are already available to passenger transport operators, whose businesses are established in this State, as follows:</p><p>- the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012 provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport; and </p><p>- provisions within Section 59 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, which allow a person established in this State to claim deductibility in respect of input costs incurred in relation to the transport of passengers outside this State.</p></reply>

Since the last questions she asked on this topic, having considered the issues, I have directed my Officials to commence work on a comprehensive review of the FOI legislation.</p>  <p>  My view remains that the FOI system as it stands is robust and functioning well. This puts us on a strong footing from which to move forward.  However, I also have noted issues that have arisen with the operation some provisions of the Act, as well as calls for a review from various stakeholders, including the Information Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The fact that no urgent interventions are required to ensure the effective operation of the FOI system allows the scope for a careful and thorough review. I am firmly of the view that the review should involve a close collaboration between my Department and the full range of interested stakeholders, from public bodies and FOI Officers to journalists, academics, activists, TDs, and perhaps most importantly the general public.</p>  <p>  Given that I have only recently directed that a review should be commenced, work is at a very early stage. My Department will shortly publish a road-map setting out the review process and anticipated time-frames. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm for the avoidance of doubt that no drafting work has been undertaken by my Department on a replacement or amendment of the Freedom of Information Act.  Once the review has been completed, consideration will be given to what changes, if any, might be made so as to improve the legislation and ensure that it continues to deliver on its goals of openness, transparency and accountability in public administration.</p>  <p>  I look forward to considering the Deputy's input as the review process moves forward.</p></reply>

Since the last questions she asked on this topic, having considered the issues, I have directed my Officials to commence work on a comprehensive review of the FOI legislation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the costing of FOI, the position remains as stated in my previous response to a similar question from the Deputy. While preparatory work was undertaken by my Officials on such a project, and a methodology was developed, the project was put on hold due to the onset of the pandemic.  However, I anticipate that costing FOI will form part of the review process that my Department is undertaking.  </p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish a road-map setting out the review process and anticipated time-frames.</p>  <p>  Similarly, issues around the bodies that are covered by the legislation may form part of the review. However, I would highlight that in fact the material scope of the legislation as it stands is very extensive, with approximately 600 bodies covered. Moreover, the legislation provides that FOI applies where a public body engages a contractor, even where the contractor rather than the body may have physical custody of the records concerned.  </p>  <p>  With that said, while in my view the FOI system as it stands is robust and provides a solid footing from which to move forward, I welcome the opportunity to consider any proposals as to how the legislation might be improved.  I look forward to considering the Deputy's input as the review process moves forward.</p></reply>

The Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It currently stands at &euro;12.30 per hour according to the Living Wage Technical Group document 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2021, is &euro;10.20 per hour, as set out in the National Minimum WageOrder (No. 2) 2020.</p>  <p>  The suggested Living Wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.</p>  <p>  Detailed data on civil service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the civil service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747. Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.20 per hour.</p>  <p>  Those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage and above through incremental progression. </p>  <p>  Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 provides for a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater) on both 1 October 2021 and 2022, as well as the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund (in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement) on 1 February 2022. The Agreement is heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments. By the end of the Agreement, the annualised pay increases will almost eliminate the cohort of civil servants earning less than the suggested living wage.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Low Pay Commission has, on request of the Government, formally begun work on examining how Ireland could move towards a Living Wage. The study will examine the design of a living wage in an Irish context and consider the policy, social and economic implications. It is expected that the report will be completed in the second half of 2021.</p></reply>

The protections for whistleblowers are to be further strengthened by the transposition of EU Directive 2019/1937, the Whistleblowing Directive, which is due to be transposed this year.</p>  <p>  Protected disclosures can be made by workers in the public and private sectors. This includes not only employees but also contractors and agency staff engaged by an organisation.</p>  <p>  A protected disclosure, as defined in Section 5 of the Act, is a disclosure of information, which, in the reasonable belief of a worker, tends to show one or more relevant wrongdoings that came to the worker's attention in connection with their employment and is disclosed in the manner prescribed in the 2014 Act. Relevant wrongdoings that can be reported include: criminal offences; failure to comply with a legal obligation; miscarriage of justice; endangerment of health and safety; damage to the environment; unlawful or improper use of public funds; oppressive; and discriminatory or negligent behaviour by a public body as well as any attempt to conceal or destroy evidence of any of the above wrongdoings.</p>  <p>  Workers can make a protected disclosure to their employer in accordance with section 6 of the Act. The vast majority of protected disclosures are made in this manner in the first instance. If a worker does not want to report to their employer or they have reported to their employer but no action or insufficient action was taken, they can report to a prescribed person under section 7 of the Act, provided they have a reasonable belief the information is substantially true. A full list of prescribed persons is available at: www.gov.ie/en/collection/41798-protected-disclosures-whistleblowing-list-of-prescribed-persons/. A worker in a public body can make a protected disclosure to a relevant Government Minister in accordance with section 8 of the Act. A worker can also make a protected disclosure to another third party in accordance with section 10 of the Act. This section is subject to a more stringent set of conditions in order for the worker to be entitled to protection.</p>  <p>  There are also special rules in place under section 17 for reporting on matters relating to law enforcement and section 18 for reporting on matters relating to security, defence, international relations and intelligence. </p>  <p>  Workers who make protected disclosures are protected from dismissal and any other form of penalisation for having made a protected disclosure. They are also protected from civil and criminal liability for any breach of confidentiality if to so was necessary in order to make a disclosure. Protection is provided through the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see from the above, entitlement to protection under the Act depends on who has made the report, the matter that has been reported and to whom the report has been made. If a worker is uncertain as to whether they qualify for protection under the Act, they should seek legal advice. In this regard, my Department provides Exchequer funding to Transparency International Ireland to operate a free Speak Up Helpline and Legal Advice Centre to assist persons who have made or are considering making a protected disclosure.  Further information can be found at: www.transparency.ie/helpline.</p></reply>

In 2018 the Commissioners of Public Works, having restored the pleasure gardens at Castletown, installed a visitor experience there which catered exclusively for parents and young children. This children's garden features a play area with play equipment, picnic benches and seats, a fairy trail and specially commissioned animal sculptures. The OPW is currently working to expand the offering with dedicated children's trails on the subjects of ecology and biodiversity. It is planned to further enhance the facilities for parents and children in this part of the site.</p>  <p>  Castletown is a very significant site for biodiversity and is the recipient of a Green Flag Award for good management of the estate and has also won the All-Ireland Pollinator award. The great majority of the parkland surrounding the great house is managed to maximise the benefit to wild flowers, meadowland plants, insects,  animals and birds. The meadow grass and associated wild plants are encouraged to grow naturally and local management does not encourage people to stray off the paths as this has a disastrous effect, particularly on ground nesting birds. Walking pathways have been cut through the meadowland to allow visitors to appreciate them and management encourage people to confine themselves to using these paths and to the extensive network on hard paths throughout the estate.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to introduce a treetop or canopy walk at Castletown as it considered that this would not be appropriate to the estate. </p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to ensure compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment which are key to demonstrating the State&rsquo;s attainment of maximum value for money through competitive procedures. To create a level playing field for all businesses across the Single European Market, EU law sets out minimum harmonised procurement rules for all Member States.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of the SME sector and continues to enhance the already substantial measures to support SMEs in accessing the public procurement market. Significant work has been undertaken by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), an office within my Department, to ensure that the opportunity to compete in public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs. Specifically, the OGP has developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10/14). These include:</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value);</p>  <p>  - Contracting authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale;</p>  <p>  - Proportionate insurance levels; and</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.</p>  <p>  This ensures that as many businesses and SMEs are aware of tendering opportunities as possible. Indeed, the latest analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 92% of the &euro;4.8 billion procurement addressable expenditure analysed is with firms with an Irish base and that the majority of spend (53%) is with the SME sector.</p>  <p>  The OGP also collaborates with Inter Trade Ireland in the delivery of a series of &lsquo;Go-2-Tender&rsquo; events. This programme has been developed to give SMEs the confidence, knowledge and practical skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts on a cross-border basis. The programme is geared towards SME&rsquo;s which want to improve their basis tendering skills to increase their success rates in public sector tenders.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in relation to public procurement including a commitment to continue to support and train Irish indigenous SMEs so that they can compete for public procurement contracts in Ireland and abroad. The OGP will support the work of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State, Ossian Smyth TD, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group with industry representative bodies ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF. The Tender Advisory Service, which was re-launched in 2018, was set-up to assist SMEs with public procurement issues. This initiative was developed following consultation with the SME Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to proactively engage with business to enhance the significant measures and strategies already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities building on the progress to date.</p></reply>

The 237 grants awarded will help support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are engaging with applicants in relation to queries regarding the outcome of their Live Performance Support Scheme application. Information in relation to the appeals process for this scheme is available on my Department's website here - www.gov.ie/en/service/ca5d7-live-performance-support-scheme-2021/. </p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of flat payments:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p>  <p>  - &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support. </p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence.

These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  As the LPT revaluation process is likely to take a number of months, detailed information on the new yield per local authority will not be available until later in the year. Accordingly, LPT allocations for 2022 will provisionally be based on updated information regarding the 2021 yield, on a no change basis i.e. the 80:20 model. All other elements are also be based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. It is recognised that the yield will change following the revaluation and the matter will be revisited at that point. </p>  <p>  My Department last week confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amounting to &euro;528m. These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3m. There will be no change to allocations for the 20 local authorities requiring equalisation funding, as their LPT yield is below their funding baseline. When detailed information on the new LPT yield becomes available, my Department will progress work on the planned move to 100% local retention of LPT and the effects on the funding system for local authorities. </p>  <p>  As previously, every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT in their local area by up to 15%; those variation decisions have not yet been made and are not reflected in these allocations. The proposed LPT Amendment Bill referred to above will bring forward the deadline for notifying Revenue of the Local Adjustment Factor (LAF) to 31 August in a revaluation year, such as this year. While I appreciate this timeframe is extremely challenging for local authorities, there is little option. The regulations have already been amended to assist local authorities to meet the earlier deadline.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the local government sector on a range of financial issues, to ensure that any additional resources that may be available are appropriately targeted. The funding for all local authorities will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process and in the context of the aforementioned LPT revaluation process.</p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted. The standardised average rent rose by 2.5% to &euro;1,256 from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020 and remained at that level in Q4 2020.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during an emergency period, from 1 August 2020 until 10 January 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration.  This ban on rent increases was targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs.</p><p>The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provides that a rent increase is not permitted to take effect during an emergency period from 11 January 2021 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. This ban on rent increases is also targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs. The delimiting of landlords&rsquo; constitutionally protected property rights has been carefully and effectively targeted in this regard.</p><p>Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is not payable by relevant tenants in respect of the emergency periods identified above. It is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period.</p><p>The maximum rent increase is 4% per annum in RPZs, irrespective of the emergency legislation.  Where a rent increase cannot be given effect for certain tenants during an emergency period, a total increase of greater than 4% can apply where the necessary rent review notice(s) have been served. In all cases, a tenant must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice before a rent increase takes effect.</p><p>The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. The Government published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 on 17 June 2021 which, if passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 12 July 2021, will extend the targeted protections of the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability.</p><p>The emergency protections against rent increases and evictions for the most vulnerable tenants has meant that they could remain in their home and not face higher rent during the pandemic. </p><p>My Department, the Housing Agency and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) keep the operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 under constant review and any necessary legislation will be progressed without delay to help provide long term security of tenure for tenants at affordable rents.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including visual amenity setback distances, sound or noise, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/8f3c71-public-consultation-on-the-revised-wind-energy-development-guideline/ </p>  <p>  The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are quite detailed and technical in nature.  My Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) have analysed the submissions received including those relating to setback distances, in conjunction with the contracted SEA and noise consultants, and are in the process of preparing finalised guidelines having undertaken detailed consideration and analysis of the submissions received.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising the technical guidance on the noise aspect in conjunction with DECC (which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters). However, this piece of work is quite technical in nature and a small number of matters remain to be resolved in this regard.</p>  <p>  Once the outstanding issues have been finalised by both Departments, the proposed amendments will need to be reviewed by the SEA consultants in order to conclude the SEA process.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The scheme was open to all political parties and the funding provided was an annual grant to political parties, based on their performance in fielding women candidates in the 2019 local elections.  This funding was to be used by the parties specifically for the purposes of promoting gender balance and diversity among the party&rsquo;s candidates and elected representatives. Following engagement with a number of political parties and key stakeholders, the scheme has been reviewed and I launched a new scheme earlier this year which aims to improve gender balance and diversity among candidates to be fielded by political parties in the 2024 local elections. </p>  <p>  At its meeting of 18 May 2021, the Government approved a significant reform of the remuneration of local authority elected members.  It also noted the work of local government stakeholders in agreeing an Action Plan to implement a range of non-pay related reforms, including issues such as maternity leave, administrative supports and professional development for councillors. These reforms, taken together with the pay reforms approved, will make the role of councillor more sustainable and manageable, facilitating a cohort of members representative and fully reflective of the diverse communities they are elected to represent.</p></reply>

This Group meets regularly to monitor and coordinate delivery of social housing programmes and to identify and address any systemic issues that could block or delay progress.  In September 2020, I increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million, the threshold within which local authorities can advance their proposals for new social housing construction projects via a single funding approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  I have also enhanced the role of the Housing Delivery Coordination Office to work with all local authorities on accelerating their social housing construction programmes, including the activation of existing sites and the acquisition and development of new sites.  The restrictions on construction activity this year - following on from the 2020 restrictions - will have an unavoidable impact on the completion timelines for all housing construction, including public housing, but local authorities and AHBs know that notwithstanding the difficult circumstances, full funding is available to support the maximum possible delivery this year. </p>  <p>  The Government will be publishing a new housing strategy in the coming weeks, which will set out details of social housing delivery out to 2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards. While local authorities already have social housing construction programmes in train, I am keen that they are proactive in adding to this pipeline and, working with the AHBs, in advancing their existing projects as speedily as possible, with the assurance of the funding being available from my Department.</p>  <p>To provide transparency on the new social housing projects being advanced, my Department publishes a Social Housing Construction Status Report each quarter. These reports provide details of the social housing construction schemes completed and those in the pipeline for all local authority areas. The most recent publication covers the period up to the end of Q1 2021 and is available at the following link: www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-obrien-publishes-social-housing-construction-status-report-for-q1-2021/ The publication of this information can also give Councillors and public representatives the opportunity to work with the local authority officials to press the advancement of these social housing delivery projects, in line with the 2021 delivery targets already in place and the multi-annual targets that we will be publishing with the new housing strategy.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.</p><p>This commitment is reflected in Budget 2021, which provides for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government to fund the largest build programme, in the history of the State.</p><p>Importantly, &euro;110 million of this amount will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers and a new funding model to accelerate the delivery of cost rental homes through the Approved Housing Body sector.</p><p>&euro;75 million was allocated for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, aimed at first-time buyers buying new-build homes on private land. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people can get, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different areas.  It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks - depending on the final design, this will allow support for approximately 1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.</p><p>The new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is the first dedicated funding stream for Cost Rental housing in Ireland. CREL will assist Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in developing or acquiring new homes for Cost Rental, to accelerate implementation of this new housing sector in the immediate term. The scheme harnesses the expertise and capacity of AHBs, amply demonstrated in the provision of social housing, and builds a foundation for further AHB involvement in Cost Rental.</p><p>Under the CREL scheme, the Housing Agency will make loans available to AHBs on very favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the development or acquisition costs of new homes for Cost Rental. The Budget allocation of &euro;35 million is intended to assist the delivery and tenanting of c. 350 new homes this year, on top of the 50 new Cost Rental apartments scheduled for delivery later this year at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.</p><p>To date, my Department has issued two broad-based Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) calls for proposals to local authorities. Funding of almost &euro;200 million has been approved in principle in support of 40 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas across 9 counties, to assist in the delivery of almost 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or for rent.</p><p>Details of 35 SSF projects which received approval in principle under the two SSF calls to date are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website as follows:</p><p>Call 1 www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund/  .</p><p>Call 2 www.rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf/  .</p><p>In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to five further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, Fingal County Council&rsquo;s projects in Ballymastone, Donabate, and Hayestown, Rush and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s project in Shanganagh.</p><p>In making an application for SSF, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values.</p><p>In addition, the Land Development Agency (LDA)  is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, in considering the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. All these measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most.</p><p>The Government has also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements.</p><p>Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p><p>The Help to Buy Scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available online at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx  .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage. Further information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available at   .</p><p>Finally, I can confirm the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years. </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits/</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.</p>  <p>  In relation to affordable measures, the Affordable Housing Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, one of the aforementioned provisions. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home, much sooner than would otherwise be the case, by bridging the gap between what people have and the price of the new home they want, while also building confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply.</p>  <p>  Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and significant feedback has been factored in. Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p>  <p>  An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. </p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, &euro;310 million was made available to service local authority land for the delivery of affordable housing under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The SSF provides for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent. This fund sub-vents the cost of facilitating infrastructure, with a current maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per affordable home. This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.  On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure. </p>  <p>  To date, funding support of &euro;200 million has been allocated to enable delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or rent. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021.</p></reply>

To address this situation, a Rent Predictability Measure was introduced to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation was driving rent levels upwards most acutely. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country where rents are high and rising have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) and rent increases in those areas are capped at 4% per annum. The total number of RPZ&rsquo;s designated is 55 since Rent Predictability Measures were introduced in 2016, and encompasses over 74.04% of all registered tenancies.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 changed the expiry date of all RPZs to 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>  In relation to affordable measures, the Affordable Housing Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, one of the aforementioned provisions.

The objective is to ensure long-term strategic housing needs are met. The purpose of the HNDA is to: (1) assist local authorities to develop long-term strategic views of housing need across all tenure, (2) provide a robust evidence base to support decisions about new housing supply, wider investment and housing related services, which inform an overall national housing profile, (3) inform policies about the proportion of social and affordable housing required, and (4) provide evidence to inform policies related to the provision of specialist housing and housing related services. Further information on the HNDA is available online at: </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/eaa99-housing-need-and-demand-assessment-hnda/.</p><p>The HNDA will inform the provision of housing, including affordable housing, helping to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system, while also recognising that a need for affordable housing exists for people of all ages. Delivery on this commitment is evidenced in the measures contained in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, currently before the Oireachtas, which provides for three schemes that will increase the supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, and (3) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme.</p><p>The delivery of affordable homes on local authority land is supported by the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). In making an application for SSF funding, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question, and that it is viable to deliver homes with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values, with the reduction remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill.</p><p>Currently, 40 SSF projects across 14 local authorities have received approval in principle which, cumulatively, will assist in the delivery of just over 4,200 affordable home to buy or rent. My Department continues to actively engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects. The first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase will at the Boherboy project in Cork City, and the first SSF project to deliver Cost Rental homes will be at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, both of which will see new homes available later this year.</p><p>In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help these first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage.</p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will also place a new form of tenure in Cost Rental on a statutory basis for the first time. Cost Rental directly links rents to the cost of provision, rather than market dynamics. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, Emmet Road in Inchicore, and Shanganagh in Shankill.</p><p>The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.</p><p>In addition to the measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a site in Shanganagh, County Dublin. Approximately 34% of the homes will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: .</p><p>Another key priority of Government is to increase social housing stock nationally by more than 50,000 units, with a key emphasis on delivering new build homes. This is complemented by our support of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in working in partnership with developers to deliver new social homes through Turnkeys arrangements, which commonly provides a faster delivery of units</p><p>Not only will each of the aforementioned measures increase much needed housing supply, they will also help return confidence, and encourage employment, in the construction sector in general. They also reflect the realisation that we need to increase housing supply, not only from the State, but from the private sector as well.</p><p>Finally, I would add that the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy, &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo;, will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of social and affordable housing over the coming years.</p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 6,813 households or 9.9% on the last assessment in June 2019. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 61,880, a reduction of 32.4%.</p><p>Below are the links to the summary reports for 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 which include the total number of qualified households on the waiting lists nationally and breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories.</p><p>In relation to the number of applicants currently on each local authority waiting list who are currently accommodated through HAP, please note that the key figure reported in the SSHA is referred to as &lsquo;net need&rsquo;. Net need is the total number of households qualified for social housing support whose need for support is not being met. This total excludes the following households:</p><p>- Duplicate applications &ndash; Where a household has applied to more than one authority for social housing support, only their first application was included in the count.</p><p>- Those in receipt of social housing support&mdash;for example, households currently living in local authority rented accommodation, approved housing body accommodation, accommodation provided under the HAP scheme, accommodation provided under the RAS, or accommodation provided under the SHCEP schemes.</p><p>- Households on a transfer list&mdash;any household that has applied for a transfer from an existing form of social housing support including HAP.</p><p>However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing through a transfer list. </p><p>Details on the number of applicants on each local authority waiting list whose main need for social housing support is that they are dependent on Rent Supplement can be found at tables 2.5 and A1.5 of the report. </p><p>In relation to the estimated time to meet applicants housing requirements, information of this type is not held by my Department. However, details on the length of time spent on the record of qualified households (waiting lists) can be found at tables 2.8 and A1.8 of the report.</p><p><b>SSHA 2020 Report</b></p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/970ea-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2020-key-findings/#:~:text=The%20Summary%20of%20Social%20Housing,is%20not%20currently%20being%20met.</p><p><b>SSHA Report 2019</b></p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/29da7-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2019-key-findings/</p><p><b>SSHA Report 2018 </b></p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/6fab90-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2018-key-findings/</p><p><b>SSHA Report 2017</b></p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/6205a6-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2017/</p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists. </p><p>In relation to affordable measures, the Affordable Housing Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p><p>Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, one of the aforementioned provisions. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home, much sooner than would otherwise be the case, by bridging the gap between what people have and the price of the new home they want, while also building confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply.</p><p>Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and significant feedback has been factored in. Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year.</p><p>In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p><p>An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan. </p><p>As part of Budget 2019, &euro;310 million was made available to service local authority land for the delivery of affordable housing under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The SSF provides for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent. This fund sub-vents the cost of facilitating infrastructure, with a current maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per affordable home. This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.  On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure. </p><p>To date, funding support of &euro;200 million has been allocated to enable delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or rent. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021.</p></reply>

NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p>  <p>  Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/.  </p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared that will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns in order to avoid over-development of those areas. I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I expect final updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising them that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the granting of permissions by local authorities, in making a decision in respect of an application for planning permission, planning authorities (and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to planning appeals) are required to consider such applications in the context of the relevant Development Plan, or Local Area Plan where one exists for the area, as well as any relevant Ministerial Guidelines.</p>  <p>  It is noteworthy that there has been strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years &ndash; with more than 25,000 rural house planning permissions granted in last 5 years.  In the same period, more than 90% of that number of rural homes were built, comprising around one in three out of all houses completed in Ireland between 2016 and 2020.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is unlikely that the construction of rural housing as opposed to scheme housing or apartments would have any alleviating impact on the construction sector.  There are diseconomies including supply chain and transaction costs associated with developing housing on multiple dispersed sites in comparison to larger-scale projects on a single site.</p></reply>

An initial prototype mapping tool has already been completed and is available on the LDA website.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency Bill  2021 will put the register on a statutory basis.  When completed, it will contain information on all relevant public lands, including lands owned by local authorities in urban population areas greater than 10,000.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Kildare area, the LDA have lodged a planning application for a development on the 10.08 acre site at Devoy Barracks in Naas. Subject to a successful grant of planning permission, it is estimated that this site has the potential to provide 221 units. Under the Serviced Sites Fund, the Ardclough Road project in Celbridge, Co. Kildare has received approval in principle and will assist in the delivery of 10 affordable homes.</p>  <p>  In relation to local authority land, Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. As such, it is a matter for each local authority to control its own land assets.</p>  <p>  In utilising their own lands for social housing purposes, my Department provides 100% funding to local authorities in this regard. The Housing Delivery Coordination Office works with all local authorities on accelerating their social housing construction programmes, including the activation of existing sites and the acquisition and development of new sites.</p></reply>

An integral part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, the Protocol is the agreed way to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border, and protect the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it.</p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, and other British Government Ministers, including the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, Lord Frost, on issues related to Northern Ireland, including implementation of the Protocol. I am also in regular and ongoing contact with political leaders in Northern Ireland on these issues.</p>  <p>  Throughout these engagements, I have continued to make clear that our shared goal must be full implementation of the Protocol to minimise the disruption caused by Brexit in Northern Ireland. I have welcomed the ongoing engagement between the EU and the UK on outstanding issues and stressed the need for these issues to be dealt with by the UK and the EU working together, in partnership.  </p>  <p>  I also continue to listen carefully to the genuine concerns that are there and will continue to advocate for appropriate flexibilities with regard to implementation within the framework of the Protocol so that the negative impact of Brexit on the people of Northern Ireland is minimised. This has always been the aim of the Protocol: to minimise the disruption which Brexit was inevitably going to cause for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  We should also note opportunities presented by the Protocol for Northern Ireland &ndash; unique, full access to both the UK internal market and the EU Single Market of 450 million people. This presents real opportunities for trade, for inward investment, and for jobs which would benefit all communities in Northern Ireland. Politicians and stakeholders from across these islands should be highlighting that and helping to fully exploit these opportunities to improve prosperity across Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of the recent political developments in Northern Ireland, including within the DUP, I look forward to working with the next leader of the DUP, with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and with all the parties in the Northern Ireland Executive, for the benefit of people in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that North South co-operation, a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, is protected under the Protocol. The North South Ministerial Council brings our Government and the Northern Ireland Executive together to oversee and further develop this co-operation. While I regret that last week&rsquo;s Council plenary was postponed, I look forward to a rescheduled meeting of the Council in the period ahead. </p></reply>

The Government regularly engages with the British Government, including through the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British Irish Council. The Government is also in regular ongoing contact with both members of the Executive and of the British Government. </p>  <p>  The NSMC is essential to overseeing and developing North South co-operation on matters of mutual interest, including the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The important work of the NSMC to develop co-operation on an all-island basis has resumed following the New Decade New Approach agreement. Two successful NSMC plenary meetings have now taken place, as well as a number of Sectoral meetings at Ministerial level, and progress continues across the breadth of North-South areas of co-operation. It is regrettable that it was necessary to postpone the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council scheduled for 18 June, and we will seek to find an early date for that to be rescheduled.</p>  <p>  The Government also looks forward to enhanced roles for the British Irish Council and British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), as set out in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The BIC, which is provided for under the Good Friday Agreement brings together: the Irish Government; British Government; Scottish Government; Northern Ireland Executive; Welsh Government; Isle of Man Government; Government of Jersey and Government of Guernsey to &ldquo;promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands&rdquo;. The Government has participated in a range of BIC meetings this year on a diverse range of topics including: collaborative spatial planning, housing, and digital inclusion. On Friday, 11 June 2021 the Government attended the 35th BIC summit in Co. Fermanagh. </p>  <p>  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement, bringing together the British and Irish Governments under Strand Three of the Good Friday Agreement to promote bilateral co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  The Agreement provides for meetings of the Conference concerned with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters on which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals.  It also provides that the Conference may consider all-island cross-border co-operation on non-devolved issues. The Government will host a BIIGC on Thursday, 24 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Members of the Oireachtas also engage with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through the North South Inter-Parliamentary Association, which is to hold a virtual preliminary plenary on 25 June with a view to holding an &ldquo;in-person&rdquo; plenary (hosted by the Ceann Comhairle) in September/October. Similar engagement with Parliamentarians happens through the British Irish Parliamentary Association, whose next plenary is scheduled for October 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government strongly supports the Stormont House Agreement framework. It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented. Where, particularly with regards to legacy, the UK Government are proposing significant changes to that framework, we have made clear that these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>  <p>  The achievements of the peace process must never be taken for granted and we will continue to work with both the British Government and the Northern Executive to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements in all circumstances.</p></reply>

The important work of the NSMC to develop co-operation on an all-island basis has resumed following the NDNA agreement. Two successful NSMC plenary meetings have now taken place, as well as a number of Sectoral meetings at Ministerial level, and progress continues across the breadth of North-South areas of co-operation.  It is regrettable that it was necessary to postpone the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council scheduled for 18 June, and we will seek to find an early date for that to be rescheduled.</p>  <p>  The Government also looks forward to enhanced roles for the British Irish Council (BIC) and British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), as set out in the Programme for Government. The Government participated in a BIC meeting on Friday, 11 June 2021, where members of the Irish Government; UK Government; Scottish Government; Northern Ireland Executive; Welsh Government; Isle of Man Government; Government of Jersey and Government of Guernsey, met and discussed, among other issues, matters related to devolution. The Government will also host a BIIGC in Dublin on Thursday, 24 June 2021, where matters relating to developing the East-West relationship and related developments in Northern Ireland will be discussed with the UK Government. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work closely on a North/South and East-West basis in support of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and successor agreements. </p></reply>

Ireland is playing, and will continue to play, a full and active part in these engagements.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland specifically &ndash; itself a special effort to resolve issues arising from Brexit for the island of Ireland &ndash; Ireland attends and contributes to the meetings of the Joint and Specialised Committees seeking to resolve the various outstanding issues. </p>  <p>  Some have sought to characterise the Protocol as the problem. However it is clear that Brexit itself is the problem, and the Protocol is the agreed joint solution to address the challenges caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. It is the result of a painstaking process which took more than four years. The Protocol prevents a hard border on this island, secures the gains of the Good Friday Agreement, and protects the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it.</p>  <p>  As a jointly negotiated agreement, the Protocol now needs to be jointly implemented in good faith. Earlier this month, the Joint Committee met to take stock of progress and to give consideration to the identified issues of concern. EU and UK officials continue to work intensively on developing solutions to these outstanding issues. Ireland supports and encourages these efforts.</p>  <p>  Working together like this is the only path to sustainable solutions. Unilateral actions on sensitive issues in Northern Ireland never work. UK unilateral actions taken to date have damaged trust. In that regard I am encouraged by the decision of the UK Government to seek EU agreement on extending the grace period on chilled meat products. </p>  <p>  We want to see positive momentum in the EU-UK relationship. We will continue to advocate so that the negative impact of Brexit on the people of Northern Ireland is minimised. This has always been the aim of the Protocol: to minimise the disruption which Brexit was inevitably going to cause for the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly engaged on Brexit-related political and economic developments. Ireland has played, and will continue to play a full and committed role on Brexit issues through the structures of the agreements, as well as through direct interactions with stakeholders and counterparts in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the European Union and beyond. </p>  <p>  With regard to the trading and commercial implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland &ndash; it has always been clear that Brexit had the potential to be profoundly disruptive for Northern Ireland.  We are listening carefully to genuine concerns and are committed to supporting engagement between the UK and EU to address outstanding issues appropriately within the framework of the Protocol. We are also highlighting the significant potential opportunities for Northern Ireland through the Protocol, with open access to the rest of the UK internal market and to the entire EU Single Market of more than 450 million people - a unique benefit for Northern Ireland in seeking more foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  There are also of course options to reduce the burden on businesses. An SPS agreement, even on a temporary basis, would offer a clear win and has broad support in Northern Ireland from right across society. This could reduce the level of checks on agri-food products travelling from GB to NI by up to 80% - this is a prize worth fighting for. People right across the political, business, retail, and farming sectors in Northern Ireland have made clear that they favour such an agreement. The EU Commission has said it could be put in place within weeks. Reaching such an agreement would be a simple, concrete and popular step, which we strongly support.</p></reply>

This includes greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. Although Covid 19 has been the understandable focus in the year since the NDNA was reached, nevertheless progress has been made to implement those important commitments.</p>  <p>  It is also welcome that the Secretary of State last week gave an assurance that the positive measures agreed in support of linguistic diversity and cultural expression in Northern Ireland will be put in place through legislation in Westminster in October in the event that this balanced cultural package is not enacted through the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>  <p>  The important work of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) has resumed, to develop co-operation on an all-island basis.

Conflict, economic shocks related to COVID-19 alongside the impacts of climate change led to 155 million people experiencing acute food insecurity - an increase of 20 million people from the previous year. </p>  <p>  Across 55 countries, over 75 million children under five were stunted (too short for their ages) and over 15 million wasted (too thin for their ages). Africa remains disproportionally affected by acute food insecurity, and in a number of countries the situation is deteriorating. Conflict remains a major driver of hunger, and insecurity is a barrier to providing timely and effective assistance.</p>  <p>  Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, established a Task Force on Preventing Famine in March 2021. The Task Force aims to bring high-level attention to famine prevention and mobilize support to the most affected countries.</p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council, Ireland plays a leading role on hunger and conflict. Working with Niger, we are leading on the implementation of Resolution 2417, which recognizes the imperative of addressing conflict driven hunger and deals with issues such as starvation as a weapon of war and the denial or impeding of humanitarian access. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the UN Secretary-General will convene a Food Systems Summit as part of the Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs by 2030. The Summit will launch ambitious initiatives to deliver progress on the SDGs, by building healthier, more sustainable, and equitable food systems.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a leader in the fight against hunger.

Over 155 million people experienced acute food insecurity at crisis levels, or worse, an increase of around 20 million people from the previous year,</p>  <p>  Women and children are particularly affected by hunger and food insecurity. Nearly half of all deaths in children under age five are attributable to undernutrition. In 2019, 21 per cent of all children under age five (144 million) were stunted and 49.5 million children experienced wasting. Women and girls represent more than 70 per cent of people facing chronic hunger. They are more likely to reduce their meal intake in times of food scarcity and may be pushed to engage in negative coping mechanisms, such as transactional sex and child, early and forced marriage. </p>  <p>  Conflict is the main cause of acute hunger; 70 per cent of the top 20 countries at risk of food insecurity are in fragile and conflict-affected situations. Economic shocks, many caused by COVID-19, and extreme weather events, associated with climate change have also contributed significantly to increasing levels of hunger, and the particular vulnerability of women and children. </p>  <p>  The UN and partner organizations aim to assist 160 million people most in need across 56 countries in 2021 and require a total of $35 billion to do so. </p>  <p>  Through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland works with partners, including the EU, the UN, the Red Cross and NGOs to save lives and protect the dignity of people affected by crises. In 2019, Ireland provided humanitarian assistance in the amount of &euro;185 million. Our assistance focuses on reaching the furthest behind. It includes a three-year strategic partnership with the International Rescue Committee to address Gender-based violence (GBV) in emergencies, and to support the empowerment of women and girls in humanitarian crises, with a budget of &euro;4.5 million. </p></reply>

This includes our work across the UN system, including at the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly, and at the UN Human Rights Council. The rights of women and children are central to our engagement and especially so in regards to conflict zones. </p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council the issue of trafficking in persons and the issue of child soldiers are considered in the context of certain country-specific discussions. Ireland actively engages in these discussions in addition to co-chairing the Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security. UN Security Council resolution 2331 on Islamic State, recognised the trafficking of women and girls in conflicts as a form of violence against women.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also a member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict which addresses the issue of child soldiers and ensures follow up of the recommendations at country level. Additionally, Ireland seeks to mainstream child protection across the work of the Council.</p>  <p>Ireland also engages actively at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). The 47th   session of the Council began on 21 June and Ireland will make national statements on a broad range of thematic issues and country-specific human rights situations including in regard to trafficking and violence against women. My Department meets regularly with the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally from NUI Galway. On 28 June Professor Mullally will present her report on the principle of non-punishment of victims of human trafficking and Ireland will deliver a national statement during the subsequent interactive dialogue.</p>  <p>  At EU level, combating trafficking is a key priority in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024. The Plan&rsquo;s objectives include promoting measures to prevent and fully eradicate trafficking in human beings, including by countering impunity for all perpetrators involved.</p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland provides core funding to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). IOM works in partnership with governments, the United Nations, international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and development partners on all aspects of counter-trafficking responses: prevention, protection, and prosecution.</p></reply>

Ireland fully supports the Council Conclusions on Hong Kong adopted by the EU last July, which set out a coordinated response package of measures in various fields including the operation of Member States' extradition agreements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong. In line with these Conclusions, on 13 October 2020, the Government agreed to suspend Ireland&rsquo;s Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong. I also raised the matter of Hong Kong in my recent meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, on 30 May.</p>  <p>  The EU has also issued a number of statements in response to this situation. Most recently the High Representative and Vice President issued a statement on 9 June which stated that the EU will continue to pay increased attention to the situation in Hong Kong as part of the overall relations between the European Union and China. Prior to this, EU Member States issued a statement on 11 March which highlights our regret that the fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, and political pluralism that are central to Hong Kong's identity and prosperity are under increasing pressure by authorities. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the EU has raised its concerns regarding the situation with Chinese authorities on a number of occasions, including directly during the most recent EU-China Summit and EU-China Leaders' Meetings, and in multilateral fora such as the Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly condemned the coup carried out by the Myanmar military and its use of violence against civilians. The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish, and does nothing to tackle the public health, security or economic issues faced by the people of Myanmar. I have called upon the Myanmar military to demonstrate restraint; respect human rights and the rule of law; immediately release political detainees; and restore legitimate civilian government. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains active on this issue within the UN Security Council. The Council has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, has strongly condemned the use of violence by the military and has called for the release of all those detained. It is welcome that the Security Council has taken a united position on this crisis as this sends a strong message to the Myanmar military. </p>  <p>  Ireland was also a member of the core group for the Resolution on Myanmar that was comprehensively adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 June, which included a call on all states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar. The Irish Mission to the UN continues to follow developments closely.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, I have endorsed the adoption of three rounds of EU sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them, the most recent round being adopted on 21 June. Ireland will continue to urge the consideration by the EU of further measures that would be effective in working to restore the democratic path in Myanmar without negatively affecting developmental gains or exacerbating the humanitarian situation. </p>  <p>  Military rule opens significant scope for further human rights abuses in Myanmar and Ireland has voiced its concern at the Special Session and the 46th Regular Session of the Human Rights Council. We welcome the unanimous resolutions agreed at both sessions. The consensus shown by the Human Rights Council is a significant and positive signal of accord on this issue within the international community.  </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor these situations and to raise our concerns in relation to Hong Kong, Myanmar and elsewhere, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. </p></reply>

The Court was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute. Ireland is a party to the Rome Statute.  The Court promotes and upholds the rule of law and provides a means to bring to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, including war crimes. In this way it contributes in a most fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice. </p>  <p>  While the ICC is central to the overall framework for international criminal justice, it is a court of last resort. The ICC does not substitute for national judicial systems. States bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes. There is also a range of other international criminal justice mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability. While individual EU Member States may investigate and prosecute international crimes, and cooperate with each other in this regard, the EU and therefore the EU Court of Justice have limited competence with respect to criminal law matters.</p>  <p>  Referrals to the International Criminal Court may only be made with respect to crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court namely: the crime of aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction is limited to the territory or nationals of States Parties to the Rome Statute, States that have accepted the Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction on an ad hoc basis and situations referred to it by the Security Council of the United Nations. This jurisdiction must be triggered in one of three ways: a situation may be referred to the Court by a State Party to the Rome Statute; a situation may be referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council; or the Prosecutor may initiate a propio motu investigation into crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court (an investigation on the Prosecutor&rsquo;s own initiative). Referrals by the United Nations Security Council are made pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and must receive nine affirmative votes at the Council. Any one of the five permanent Council Members (P5) has the power to veto a proposed referral.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its EU partners has been, and continues to be, a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. Furthermore, ensuring accountability is one of the key principles underpinning our engagement on the United Nations Security Council. We will support and defend the Court throughout our two-year term on the Council, which started on 1 January 2021 and continue to seek accountability as a key foreign policy priority in all relevant international fora.</p></reply>

The detention of political opponents, demonstrators and journalists is a growing concern.  I, and my officials, regularly raise human rights issues in bilateral dialogue with a wide range of countries, including the issue of unlawful detention where relevant. </p><p>Ireland is also a strong contributor to European Union and United Nations efforts to address unlawful detentions and in particular to protect Human Rights Defenders.</p><p>The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has a mandate to investigate allegations of individuals being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary way or inconsistently with international human rights standards, and to recommend remedies such as release from detention and compensation. The Working Group held its 90<sup>th</sup>session from 3 to 12 May 2021 during which it  adopted 21 opinions concerning deprivation of liberty of 68 individuals in 21 countries. </p><p>Ireland regularly intervenes at the Human Rights Council and other relevant UN bodies to urge an end to unlawful detention.  UN Special Rapporteurs have issued a number of statements in relation to individual cases and Ireland works closely with them, particularly with Ms. Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders. </p><p>The European Union Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-24) provides a framework for the EU to leverage influence on broader human rights issues including unlawful detention. Ireland participates actively in EU Human Rights Dialogues with third countries and in multilateral fora. </p><p>Finally, in February of this year Ireland joined a newly established coalition of 63 countries, led by Canada, to endorse a Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State to State Relations. The Declaration aims to protect citizens of all countries from arbitrary detention abroad through coordinated action to uphold core human rights principles.</p></reply>

An integral part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, the Protocol is the agreed way to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and to protect the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it. </p>  <p>  I am in regular and ongoing contact with British government counterparts and with political leaders and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland on implementation of the Protocol. We all have a responsibility to listen to the genuine concerns and engage with citizens, businesses, politicians and community leaders in the North. We also have to be clear there is no agreed alternative to the problems caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland besides the Protocol &ndash; a solution which was jointly negotiated, jointly agreed and which now needs to be jointly implemented. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the Protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set down in the Good Friday Agreement. The Protocol prevents a hard border on this island and protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Throughout these engagements, I have continued to make clear that our shared goal must be full implementation of the Protocol to minimise the disruption caused by Brexit in Northern Ireland. I have welcomed the ongoing engagement between the EU and the UK on outstanding issues and stressed the need for these outstanding issues to be dealt with by the UK and the EU working together, in partnership.  </p>  <p>  I also continue to listen carefully to the genuine concerns that are there and will continue to advocate for appropriate flexibilities with regard to implementation within the framework of the Protocol, so that the negative impact of Brexit on the people of Northern Ireland is minimised. This has always been the aim of the Protocol: to minimise the disruption which Brexit was inevitably going to cause for Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

The effective and full implementation of the agreements is a priority for Ireland and the EU. The TCA allows cooperation with the UK to continue in a range of key areas, establishing a substantial framework for continued engagement. While it does not replicate the status quo ante, it does provide for tariff and quota free trade for qualifying goods between our respective markets &ndash; ensuring that Ireland and the UK will remain strongly connected as trade partners.</p>  <p>  The full implementation of the Protocol, which forms part of an EU-UK agreement, is important to Ireland in terms of our core objectives in relation to minimising the negative impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland, including safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, and protecting the Single Market, and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p>  <p>  Our shared goal must be the full implementation of the Protocol to minimise the disruption caused by Brexit in Northern Ireland. Achieving the smooth and sustainable operation of the Protocol will also contribute significantly to improved EU-UK relations. Ireland will do all it can as an EU member state in support of that goal. </p>  <p>  In this context, and while taking full account of developments in EU-UK relations and the areas where EU legal competence applies, we continue our bilateral engagement, including through the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement; and by investing in our capacity and relationships right across the UK. The British Irish Council Summit on 11 June and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference taking place today are important in this regard, as was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the UK Prime Minister in May and my own visits to London in April and June.  In terms of ongoing investment, we agreed new bilateral frameworks for cooperation with the devolved administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh earlier this year.  Additionally, I look forward to officially opening our new Consulate General in Manchester and our re-established Consulate General in Cardiff in the coming months. </p>  <p>  I remain ambitious for the British-Irish bilateral relationship - and the full implementation of the TCA and the Withdrawal Agreement will provide the best possible basis for the growth and development of that relationship into the future.</p></reply>

Worldwide, conflict remains the primary driver of hunger and humanitarian crises. </p>  <p>  The number and complexity of these crises globally has increased in recent years but each conflict is unique in its character, scale and complexity, and as such cannot be ranked by any single set of criteria of severity.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong contributor to global efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, and to address hunger and violations of human rights. Central to this is our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our Membership of the European Union and the United Nations. </p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council, Ireland is actively promoting accountability and compliance with international law in our work on the Council and its subsidiary bodies, including through the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, which Ireland is co-chairing, and the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. </p>  <p>  Accountability, including for crimes against humanity, is important not only as a means of pursuing justice for victims, but also as a crucial component to create stability and peace in post-conflict situations. A strong international criminal justice system is central to fighting impunity and in deterring future violations. </p>  <p>  While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. Ireland, together with its EU partners is a consistent and strong supporter of the Court. We will continue to support and defend the Court throughout our term on the United Nations Security Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland also has a long and proud tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. The Government remains committed to participation in peacekeeping operations as a tangible contribution to the protection of global peace and security including the protection of human rights. </p></reply>

The roots of hunger lie in poverty, deprivation and exclusion, exacerbated by conflict, climate change - and now COVID-19. The eradication of hunger and a particular focus on tackling undernutrition has been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s development programme since its inception. </p>  <p>  &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, makes a clear commitment to reaching the furthest behind first, including through an emphasis on food systems. For example, we allocated  &euro;25 million this year to the World Food Programme, &euro;8 million of which was targeted to the response in Syria.  </p>  <p>  Successive OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) peer reviews have commended Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation for its poverty focus and commitment to Least Developed Countries. The OECD DAC&rsquo;s most recent review, published in May 2020, notes that Ireland 'walks the talk' in allocating ODA to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  The ODI, a leading development think-tank, has also ranked Ireland as the most effective international donor in directing resources to those in extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  Ireland works with a variety of partners in order to reach those in greatest need around the world. Our work through the EU and United Nations give Ireland a significant global presence and footprint, including in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts. Our partnerships with Irish and other NGOs enable us to emphasize food and malnutrition in our programmes, and target assistance to those most at risk of hunger.</p></reply>

These reflect Ireland's strong commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and its targets, which remain at the heart of our approach to international development.  The Government's annual report on official development assistance is a useful resource which details the impact of Irish Aid's investments in the prior year.  The most recent annual report is available on my Department's website at: </p><p>Together with our partners, Ireland supports progress toward these goals and targets, and we are a well-respected donor. In 2020, Ireland's development programme was reviewed by its peers through the OECD Development Assistance Committee Peer Review mechanism. It found that Ireland is a strong development partner that 'walks the talk' on its poverty focus and on its commitment to least developed countries. </p><p>That said, the pandemic has dramatically set back development gains across the world and many SDG targets are in jeopardy. In 2020, over 100 million people became &quot;extremely poor&quot;. The pandemic also generated a global education crisis, especially for girls, and reversed hard-won gains in gender equality.  This will inform future programming choices. </p><p>Globally, reversing these setbacks will take considerable investment and effort from all stakeholders. Recovering the gains that have been lost due to COVID-19 is an important focus of our bilateral, multilateral and Team Europe global response. </p></reply>

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians and humanitarian workers and facilities. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, Ireland is tackling poverty, hunger and exclusion which can be a driver of support for groups such as Boko Haram and Al Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. This includes &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015, and also funding for those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded. Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;56.4 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas.  With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p>  <p>  The UN is active in the Lake Chad Basin areas affected by Boko Haram, through its Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission. Ireland is penholder together with Niger on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council, working to ensure that UNOWAS has a clear strategic direction in its work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa. In its Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 3 February, the Security Council condemned attacks against civilians in Borno State on 28 November 2020, and the abduction of schoolchildren in Katsina state, claimed by Boko Haram.</p>  <p>  The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al Shabaab.  Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council.  That Committee oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia, including engagement with Al Shabaab.  This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions.  The EU provides significant development funding to Somalia, and to countries affected by Boko Haram. Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance:  both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to peace and security across the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for its sustainable development.</p></reply>

The international community have repeatedly expressed their strong concerns regarding the ongoing repression of the Belarusian people by the Lukashenko regime across a range of international fora. Along with our EU and like-minded international partners, we will continue to ensure that international attention remains focused on the appalling human rights situation in Belarus.</p>  <p>  Despite repeated calls from the international community, the Belarusian authorities have shown no willingness to investigate violations of human rights in their own country and have permitted the security forces to act with impunity. Ireland and the EU have been clear that impunity breeds violence and we have taken a number of concrete steps to bring international accountability. </p>  <p>  Ireland has made our deep concern at the situation in Belarus clear in UN Security Council discussions on the matter. Ireland worked constructively to ensure the successful adoption of an EU-led resolution at the Human Rights Council that expanded the mandate of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate the over two thousand reported cases of human rights violations in Belarus. The High Commissioner&rsquo;s team have begun their work, which will be complemented by the NGO-led International Accountability Platform for Belarus and investigations in EU Member States under the concept of Universal Jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  We regret that the Belarusian authorities continue to deny the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus access to the country in her official capacity. Until she is given the opportunity to complete her important work, we will continue to support the renewal of her mandate, including during the ongoing forty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council. We will also continue to call on the regime to implement the recommendations of OSCE expert investigator, Professor Wolfgang Benedek, which are outlined in his November 2020 Moscow Mechanism Report. </p>  <p>  Sanctions also play a role in bringing international accountability and as a signal of solidarity with the Belarusian people. I and my fellow EU foreign ministers agreed a fourth package of targeted sanctions during the 21 June Foreign Affairs Council, bringing the total number of those sanctioned to one hundred and sixty-six individuals, including Lukashenko himself, and fifteen economic entities. Those targeted include those responsible for the ongoing repression, the coercive forced landing of the Ryanair aircraft on 23 May, the falsification of the August 2020 Presidential election result in Belarus, and those supporting or profiting from the Lukashenko regime. </p>  <p>  The EU is working on operationalising carefully calibrated economic sanctions that target the wallets of the regime. This is one of the concrete measures agreed by EU leaders at the European Council on 24 May, in response to the flagrant disregard for international law and human rights shown by the Belarusian authorities. Ireland is playing a constructive role and we remain open to considering further measures at a later stage.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners continue to support the Belarusian people as best we can by redirecting EU funding away from the regime and towards civil society. Member States have also coordinated on efforts taken at national level to provide support. For our part, Ireland contributed national funds to two projects through the European Endowment for Democracy that seek to protect the human rights and media freedoms of the Belarusian people. In a further signal of support, on 28 May the EU Commission announced a &euro;3 billion economic support package for a future democratic Belarus.</p>  <p>  Our focus remains on pressing the Lukashenko regime to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Belarusian people, to adhere to their international commitments, and to engage in a meaningful national dialogue that leads to fresh elections that are free and fair. That is what we will continue to do. </p></reply>

The Review Group may make recommendations in relation to possible awards in respect of Jadotville.</p><p>In line with the Terms of Reference, the Independent Review Group will examine, report and make recommendations in relation to the &lsquo;Battle of Jadotville&rsquo; from 13 to 17 September 1961 and will report its findings to the Chief of Staff. </p><p>The Independent Review Group have been actively engaged in the consultation and research process and was originally due to conclude by 31st March 2021.  However, given the sheer volume of meetings and the comprehensive nature of the research process, an interim report was submitted and an extension to the timeframe for reporting to the Chief of Staff was requested.</p><p>Taking into account the volume of research material and engagement being undertaken by the Independent Review Group in the course of its work on this very important matter, this request for extension was acceded to.  It is expected that the Independent Review Group will submit it's final report to the Convening Authority shortly. </p><p>Once the work of the Indpendent Review Group has been  completed, the Chief of Staff will make recommendations, as appropriate, to my Office.</p><p>At this juncture, it would be premature to state if the interim  report or the final report, once submitted, will be published or released.  I will await the outcome of the work of the Independent Review Group and the recommendations of the Chief of Staff in due course.  When the final report has been received and any findings have been given due consideration, a decision on the release of the interim report and final report will then be made, taking into account any legal or other considerations arising. </p></reply>

There were concerns about issuing guidelines in the current Covid context where the safe and sustainable reopening of schools remains the overriding priority for all stakeholders. </p><p>It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to issue Guidelines to schools on the use of reduced timetables for the next school year.</p><p>It is intended that the guidelines will include measures by which schools will be required to report on the use of reduced timetables. </p><p>Until such time as this reporting mechanism is in place, data is not available as to the number of pupils who are currently on reduced timetables.</p><p>In relation to the number of appeals taken under Section 29 of the Education Act against suspension or refusal to enrol pupils with special educational needs, Section 7 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018 came into operation on the 12 November 2020 and provided for the replacement of the existing Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 with a series of new sections numbered 29 to 29F. </p><p>These new appeal provisions in sections 29 to 29F are designed to work alongside the wider admissions framework in the 2018 Act. In accordance with section 29B of the Education Act, 1998, the Minister also developed procedures for appeals which apply to all appeals submitted from 12 November 2020 onwards.</p><p>Since the commencement of the new arrangements for appeals on the 12 November 2020 to date, a total of 95 appeals have been taken under section 29 of the Education Act 2018 where the applicant has indicated that the child has special educational needs. This represents 29% of all appeals in the same period.</p><p>Prior to 12 November only data in relation to total numbers of appeals per appeal type was recorded and therefore the Department cannot provide data in relation to the numbers of appeals which related to children with special educational needs for previous years. </p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 2018 allows for appeals against the decision of a Board of Management of a school to suspend or permanently exclude a student. The decision of the independent appeals committee in such appeals may only be challenged by way of a Judicial Review. It is open to either party to an appeal to seek a Judicial Review.</p><p>My Department has recorded the following number of Judicial Reviews of section 29 appeal decisions in suspension and expulsion cases involving children with special educational needs in the last 3 years and to date in 2021:</p><p>2021 - 1 expulsion case</p><p>2020 &ndash; 2 expulsion cases</p><p>2019 - 3 expulsion cases and 1 suspension case</p><p>2018 &ndash; 0 cases</p><p>In relation to the number of pupils with special educational needs who may be currently on suspension, expulsion, or out of school, and for whom Section 29 cases may not have been brought forward, I wish to advise the Deputy that in accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 schools are obliged to report on school attendance, and data on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools at the aggregated level are collected by Tusla through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Attendance Report (SAR). </p><p>This latest report published presents data for the academic year 2017/18 and is available on Tusla&rsquo;s website at </p><p><i> </i></p><p>As the information requested is collected and recorded by Tusla, I have referred this part of the question to that agency, for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p><p>Finally, in respect of children with special educational needs who may not be suspended or expelled, but who may be without a school placement, I can advise that ensuring that every child has a suitable school placement is a key objective of my Department.  Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>It is the policy of my Department that all children with Special Educational Needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students with special educational needs can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p><p>In circumstances, where the NCSE confirms that no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, my Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. </p><p>It is important to note that Home tuition funding is not an alternative to a school placement, by its nature it is intended to be a short term intervention. </p><p>For this reason home tuition will not be available where a school placement has been identified by the NCSE.  </p><p>Similarly, failure to enrol a child in school will not give rise to eligibility under this scheme.</p><p>I have no plans to change this approach.</p><p>Where the NCSE have identified an available school placement for a child, the local SENO will continue to be available to engage with the family and the school concerned to ensure that the child's needs are addressed.</p><p>The total number of children with special educational needs who are being supported by the Home Tuition scheme on the grounds that they do not currently have a school placement, or an early intervention class placement, is 732. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Sanctioned</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SEN school aged no placement</td>       <td>88</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3+   (Early Intervention support)</td>       <td>522</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 During year</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6+</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>732</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As is specified in the 2012 Act, the amount of &euro;110m, plus interest of &euro;1.38m, was made available to Caranua, and held in a Statutory Fund managed by the NTMA.</p><p>To be eligible to apply to Caranua, applicants had to have been in receipt of an award of redress from the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme, or to have qualified for such an award had they not already received similar awards or settlements in court proceedings.</p><p>Given the finite nature of the funding available, Caranua announced in May 2018 that it would cease to accept applications from 1 August 2018. After that date, it mainly focussed on processing </p><p>applications on hand. It also undertook targeted outreach to certain groups, including survivors who were in prison.</p><p>As part of this process, Caranua engaged extensively with applicants who had not completed the application process, and established person-centred timelines for the provision of supporting documentation which would enable their applications to be progressed before Caranua was required to wind-down its operations. As the Deputy will appreciate, given the impending exhaustion of the funding available to it Caranua was not in a position to allow applications to remain open indefinitely. </p><p>Caranua finalised all outstanding applications and made all final payments in early December 2020, with the exception of a very limited number of cases which were referred back to Caranua on appeal, or where it had agreed to make staggered payments.</p><p>The specific details on applications requested by the Deputy are set out in the table below. These are, in the main, drawn from information published on Caranua&rsquo;s website, <i>www.caranua.ie</i>.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of applications approved and paid</th>       <th>57,161</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average payment</td>       <td>Approximately   &euro;1,700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of in   progress applications</td>       <td>Nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of ineligible applications*</td>       <td>5,009</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of  applications appealed</td>       <td>761</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of applications awaiting probate</td>       <td>Nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of  applications withdrawn</td>       <td>3,062</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Overall, Caranua received over 62,000 applications for funding supports from over 6,000 eligible survivors. Caranua made over 57,000 payments to survivors, totalling almost &euro;98 million, and each applicant received an average of over &euro;15,000 in supports. It is not possible to give an exact figure for the number of ineligible applications, but 3,062 applications were withdrawn, while a further 1,947 applications were not approved by Caranua, a total of 5,009 applications. In addition, approximately 200 individuals who applied to Caranua were determined to be ineligible for support. </p><p>With regard to appeals, section 22 of the 2012 Act provides that a decision by Caranua to not approve an application could be appealed to an Independent Appeals Officer. In total of 761 appeals were submitted to the Independent Appeals Officer. All outstanding appeals were finalised by the Independent Appeals Officer in February 2021.</p><p>With regard to administrative costs, the 2012 Act provided that all expenditure arising from Caranua&rsquo;s operations must be met from the funding held in the Statutory Fund. There is no provision in the Act for Exchequer funding to be utilised to fund either supports for survivors, or the administrative costs arising. </p><p>Caranua&rsquo;s audited financial statements to the end of 2020 show payments to survivors of approximately &euro;97.8 million, while overall administrative costs had come to approximately &euro;13.5 million. This compares favourably with comparable organisations such as Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Victims and Survivors Service, which provides funding supports to those effected by the Troubles. </p><p>With regard to other supports available to survivors, the National Counselling Service, run by the HSE, is a free nationwide service, which provides face-to-face, phone, and video counselling. It provides a specific, trauma-informed, service for adults who experienced childhood abuse and neglect. This service is available to all survivors of institutional abuse.</p><p>Since 2019, the Department has engaged extensively with former residents in a Consultation Forum facilitated by external facilitators. This process led to the publication in August 2019 of &ldquo;Consultations with Survivors of Institutional Abuse on Themes and Issues to be addressed by a Survivor Led Consultation Group&rdquo; and a further phase of consultations which are ongoing. </p><p>The meetings are facilitated by professionally qualified facilitators who are funded by my Department. Matters relating to survivors of institutional abuse identified by survivors, and which are set out in the August 2019 report, continue to be discussed by the Group. I met with the Group in December 2020 to hear about the various issues which had been identified by the Group. </p><p>It is expected this consultation process will be concluded shortly.  Their findings will be further considered by the inter-departmental group and their conclusions will inform the consideration of proposals to Government in this context.</p></reply>

The funding for this programme will amount to around &euro;16 million over a three-year period and is being provided jointly under the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) Operational Programme 2014-2020 and the Irish Exchequer. The programme will support over 2,600 young people with disabilities between 15 and 29 years of age. Pobal has been contracted by my Department to manage the programme.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Ability Programme is to help bring young people with disabilities who are not work-ready closer to the labour market through engagement in training and personal development activities, which would be followed by an incremental exposure to work. The programme is being delivered by 27 community and voluntary groups from around the country, selected on foot of a competitive process.  The projects being funded have been designed to assist young people in their transition from school to further education and employment.</p>  <p>  The WALK PEER organisation is funded as a stand-alone project under the Ability Programme and not as a programme in its own right. The project aims to support 200 young people with special educational needs aged 15-24 years within 3 special schools&rsquo; settings to develop their employment aspirations, identify their career goals and to experience work in the open labour market. Total Ability funding of &euro;640,848 has been awarded to WALK PEER over the course of the 3-year programme. </p>  <p>  If the WALK PEER project was to be replicated on the same scale to an additional 25 counties, based on a simple scale up calculation, this would require additional funding in excess of &euro;5m per year.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Walkinstown Green Social Enterprises Limited, which is wholly owned by WALK Ltd, was also awarded &euro;430,175 under the Ability Programme to fund the WALK REAL Project, bringing the total combined amount of funding to WALK Ltd to &euro;1,071,023 over the course of the Ability Programme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participation on CE prior to the year 2007 has been disregarded as part of these changes, which makes it easier for previous CE participants who had exhausted their CE entitlement to re-qualify.</p><p>Included in these changes was the duration participants can remain on CE. In general, CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for 1 year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland or QQI major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to 2 years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for a maximum of 3 consecutive years.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve-month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).</p><p>The Youth Employment Support Scheme was introduced on 1 October 2018 as a further support to those aged 18-24.  It is a work experience placement programme targeted at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or face barriers to employment.  The young person will be place with an employer for an initial period of 6 months with a view to securing full-time employment following placement. The programme aims to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.</p><p>The introduction of the Youth Employment Support Scheme has not removed the possibility of the younger cohort of unemployed people participating on CE; it has provided another option to those that require an alternative route back to employment.</p><p>I acknowledge that the challenges caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions introduced over the course of the last 16 months, has impacted CE schemes, referrals to CE schemes and the services they provide.  I met with a number of CE and T&uacute;s schemes earlier this month and we had a very constructive exchange of views on the very real challenges facing these employment support schemes, as the economy and society begins to recover from the pandemic over the coming months.</p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, Minister Humphreys and I recently announced that the current CE and T&uacute;s participants' contract extension date will be further extended until 29th October 2021.  This will bring to over 11,000 the number of  CE and T&uacute;s participants benefitting from various contract extensions going back to October 2020. There will be further transitional arrangements for the cohort of CE and T&uacute;s participants whose contracts are due to come to an end from the start of November 2021 to February 2022. </p><p>The conclusion of CE and T&uacute;s participant contracts after the 29th October 2021 will be undertaken on a coordinated and phased basis over a number of months up to February.  This approach will support the recruitment of new participants while also ensuring the ongoing delivery of important community services.</p><p>With the successful continuing roll-out of the vaccine programme and in accordance with the phased re-opening of the economy by Government, my priority and the priority of the Department is to get all CE schemes back up and running so that they can fully re-commence activities, providing work experience and training opportunities to long term unemployment participants and delivering vital services to local communities. To support this, referrals to CE schemes will increase further as the economy continues to open up.</p><p>CE sponsoring authorities are also encouraged by my Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE in their local communities.  They can advertise their vacancies on <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i>, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for job candidates and employers, including CE sponsors.</p><p>Jobseekers are advised to register their interest through this website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre who will determine their eligibility for the CE scheme.  The facility to register interest in CE schemes was introduced on the website in August 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>It is important to note that there are currently 19,398 participants on CE and 42% of these CE participants are 55 years of age and over. Placements on CE are temporary and are subject to time limits to safeguard the availability of opportunities for employment on CE schemes for other candidates. My Department supports the provision of public employment services with a priority on activation and the progression of participants on CE from the Live Register into full-time employment.</p><p>I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

As part of its free services, MABS also provides support to those in mortgage arrears and is an administrator of Abhaile - the national State funded Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.</p>  <p>  In February 2017, following extensive analysis and engagement with all stakeholders, CIB, in consultation with my Department, commenced a restructuring of governance arrangements of the then existing network of 51 local MABS companies into eight regional MABS companies. The aim of this restructuring was to enhance the services offered by MABS (and other CIB service delivery companies), to improve governance arrangements and to ensure a modern and streamlined citizen-focused service delivery model. This restructuring was completed in October 2018. </p>  <p>  To support the governance restructuring, Regional Managers were appointed to each of the eight regional  companies. Each company is overseen by a voluntary Board, which ensures that the provision of, and access to, MABS services are fair and consistent across the region. Significantly, under the revised structure, companies have the flexibility to allocate resources appropriately in response to emerging customer needs. In addition, clients in a region have access to all MABS services of the region and can contact any money advisor in that region about their case by phone, email, online chat or video conferencing. This governance restructuring saw no job losses, closure of service delivery or diminution in MABS services, and has allowed for a quick coordinated responses to emerging issues.</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is around 55% of the working population (CSO, Pension Coverage Survey 2020) and it is estimated that this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Many of these people will become reliant on the State pension for all or most of their income in retirement and accordingly, may face a significant unwanted drop in income.</p><p>Implementation of an Automatic Enrolment (AE) system will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one where employees, subject to certain parameters, will be automatically enrolled into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles:</p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers.</p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions.</p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.</p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.</p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p><p>My officials continue to work on the design of the AE system.  There are five main areas where work is ongoing so as to produce design options. These areas relate to:</p><p>- the scope and role of a Central Processing Authority for the system;</p><p>- the nature and functions of Registered Providers of savings products;</p><p>- the investment framework and funds to be offered by Registered Providers, including the design of the default fund and the pay-out phase;</p><p>- the design of the State financial incentive; and</p><p>- the phasing of implementation.</p><p>The development of these policy proposals is at an advanced stage and, as set out in the recently published Economic Recovery Plan 2021, the overall design of the system will be decided later this year.

These entities, reviewed the existing contracted PES, engaging extensively with current employment service providers and other stakeholders in the process.</p>  <p>  My Department received the report from the Institute for Employment Studies last year. The review makes a significant contribution to the ongoing process of procuring contracted employment service capacity to supplement the existing capacity of my Department's Intreo offices. </p>  <p>  As the design of the different Requests for Tender for the procurement of employment services later this year is still being considered and the views of the IES are informing this design process, no decision on a date of publication has been made for the IES/Social Finance review.</p></reply>

The current JobPath contracts were originally due to expire at the end of 2020. Last October, however, in addition to contract renewals to the local employment services, job clubs and EmployAbility, I announced an extension of referrals to the JobPath service for a further 12 months until the end of 2021. This was in the context of Covid-19 restrictions which made the procurement of new services extremely difficult and placed a premium on a continuity of services.</p>  <p>  While new referrals will cease at the end of December 2021, there will be a run-off period to enable existing clients to complete their engagement with the service.

The scheme aimed to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. The scheme provided a supportive structure for participants, including case worker support for both placement hosts and jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme's inception, a total of 1,000 people have commenced a placement, with 50 jobseekers currently on YESS placements. </p>  <p>  The type of work experience undertaken by participants involved roles across a number of different sectors including community and voluntary, hospitality and food, ICT and telecoms, manufacturing, retail, sales and marketing, science and healthcare and construction. Recruitment to the scheme in the scheme was severely affected by Covid-19 from 2020, with fewer hosts advertising vacancies due to impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions on business operations and employment. </p>  <p>  An internal review of the first year of the YESS programme, from October 2018 to October 2019,  is underway.  The report of this review has not been finalised due to demands of other work on foot of the pandemic.  It is intended that once the new work placement programme commences in line with the Economic Recovery Plan, a full review and evaluation of YESS will be undertaken and made available.  It is anticipated that this will be finalised over the coming months.  </p></reply>

The Acts were drafted in such a way as to comprehend the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent.  It is important to note that the entitlement to Parent&rsquo;s Leave is for the individual parent.  It is not an allocation per family.  </p>  <p>  Under Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/1158, commonly known as the Work-Life Balance Directive, Member States must provide for each worker to have an individual right to parental leave, two months of which cannot be transferred.

As set out in Revenue guidance, the scheme has two elements as follows:</p><p>- It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll; and</p><p>- It charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p><p>To qualify for the EWSS, as well as having tax clearance, employers must be able to show that their business experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders over a defined period. However, Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC/SAC) Employers registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Child Care Act 1991 are included in the EWSS with no turnover test.</p><p>For planning purposes, my Department has undertaken some estimates of the scale of this support for the ELC/SAC sector.  The figures provided below are based on data from a number of sources and underpinned by a series of assumptions so should be interpreted with caution and considered as indicative only.  It is also important to note that they refer only to potential allocation, not drawdown. </p><p>When introduced in September 2021, the standard EWSS rates applied (as set out in the table below). Based on these figures and estimates about wages in the sector, the weekly cost of EWSS for the ELC/SAC sector was estimated to be &euro;4.8m.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Gross weekly pay</th>       <th>Standard Rates</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than &euro;151.50</td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;151.50 &ndash;  &euro;202.99</td>       <td>&euro;151.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;203 - &euro;1,462</td>       <td>&euro;203 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Over &euro;1,462</td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With these rates, ELC/SAC services were estimated to have approximately 60% of payroll costs covered. This equated to approximately 38% of the usual operating costs of these services &ndash; allowing services to operate sustainably in a context of lower occupancy and higher delivery costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The rate of subsidy employers receive per paid eligible employee under EWSS was revised on 20 October (as set out in the table below). As announced by the Minister for Finance on 1<sup>st</sup>June, these revised rates remain in place until end September 2021. </p><p>Work undertaken by my Department indicates that, further to the introduction of the revised rates, ELC/SAC services with EWSS are estimated to have approximately 80% of payroll costs covered. This equates to approximately 50% of the usual operating costs of these services.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Gross weekly   pay</th>       <th>Revised Rates</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than   &euro;151.50</td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;151.50 &ndash;   &euro;202.99</td>       <td>&euro;203 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;203 - &euro;299.99</td>       <td>&euro;250 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;300 - &euro;399.99</td>       <td>&euro;300 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;400 - &euro;1,462</td>       <td>&euro;350 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Over &euro;1,462</td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This estimated cost of EWSS for ELC/SAC, at standard and enhanced rates, was derived by my Department using data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile gathered by Pobal which includes data on gross weekly pay of individual staff working in the sector.  This was used to infer the individual EWSS subsidy rates that would apply in respect of staff across the sector. These individual EWSS subsidy rates were summed to arrive at the total weekly cost of EWSS to the sector. </p><p>There are approximately 56 weeks between 1 September 2020 and 30 September 2021. Of these 56 weeks, the EWSS operated at standard rates for 7 weeks and will operate at enhanced rates for 49 weeks. Assuming an estimated weekly EWSS cost of &euro;4.8m at standard rates and &euro;7.4 million at enhanced rates, the total cost of the EWSS over this period may be estimated to be approximately &euro;430m. This estimate assumes all ELC/SAC employers continue to avail of EWSS in July and August. However, ordinarily, just 40% of ELC/SAC providers operate during these months.</p><p>It is not possible to breakdown these estimates in the manner requested by the Deputy.  </p><p>It is important to note that the estimates provided above relate to allocations for EWSS and not draw down.  The actual spend on EWSS is a matter for Revenue.</p></reply>

The Student Grant Scheme also provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  Before adjustments for the number of dependent children, additional persons in college and income disregards, which can bring the qualifying income threshold up, the highest standard income threshold for a fee only grant is &euro;54,240.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. In relation to other supports the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial support to full- and part-time students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education. Under the Fund, financial support can be provided to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including a number of categories such as books and other class material, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills, essential travel, childcare costs etc. In response to the Covid19 pandemic, the SAF allocation for the 2020/21 academic year was doubled from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;16.2 million. Since 2017, an additional &euro;1 million per year has been allocated to the SAF with HEIs asked to prioritise and ring-fence this element of funding for the support of part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. An additional &euro;1 million was added to the fund in 2018 for students attending Professional Masters of Education (PME) courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This additional funding was also made available for the 2019/20 year and again in 2020/21. In relation to other supports tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;192.3m.</p>  <p>  Most Irish and EU undergraduate students can expect to pay between &euro;4,000 and &euro;7,500 in student contribution and tuition fees.  For the purposes of this calculation, if all undergraduate students in receipt of SUSI support were to pay maximum fees of &euro;7,500.  The total cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of &euro;80.6m.</p>  <p>  With regards to Post Graduates.  EU and EEA Post Graduate students can expect the cost for a year of full time study to be between &euro;4,000 and &euro;9,000.  There were 2,518 students in receipt of a SUSI grant for the academic year at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;9.13m.  For the purposes of this calculation, if all post graduates students were to pay maximum fees of &euro;9,000 the additional cost to the exchequer would be in the region of &euro;13.53m.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, amongst other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. The review of the Student Grant Scheme is underway with over 250 submissions received via the public consultation process and over 9,000 survey responses were received through an online survey process. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.  At this point I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review to indicate when any proposed changes will come into effect.</p></reply>

This Working Group is comprised of the sectoral representatives of students, staff and providers alongside representatives of relevant Government Departments such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  This Working Group is planning for a limited, safe return of on-site activity, which comprises small group in-person learning to cater exclusively for needs of the existing cohort of ELE students currently in the State. This approach for on-site activity is consistent with small group learning across further, higher and adult education. To enable this to happen, all existing restrictions and public health guidance with appropriate protective measures and limited congregation will be followed supported by reopening protocols and an adaptation framework that are aligned with public health guidelines to facilitate and ensure the safe return to classroom activity for this cohort of students. The Working Group has worked collaboratively to develop these sectoral reopening protocols and supporting materials and this work is now nearing finalisation.</p>  <p>  This approach notes the sector is much reduced with estimates placing student numbers at less than 10,000 currently in the State in comparison to pre-pandemic levels where the sector has capacity to facilitate approximately 200,000 foreign learners annually.   Prospective ELE learners in the State not previously enrolled and students who are not currently in the country are not included in these planned on site activities.</p>  <p>  ELE providers have been advised that there remains no basis for the recruitment of new international students who might travel to the country at this time. However, the initial resumption of in-person activity will represent a key step on the pathway to recovery for the ELE sector in Ireland. My Department will continue to engage with ELE stakeholders as this sector moves, aligned with public health advice, including any such advice in relation to international travel, towards its full re-opening and continues on a path to recovery.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware the prisoner complaints system was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in November 2012, based on a model recommended by the then-Inspector of Prisons.  </p><p>All prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and are treated with the utmost seriousness. The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' through to a 'Category F' complaint. </p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or anyother conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Prison Service. Category A complaints are independently investigated by persons outside the Prison Service. Category B complaints are serious level complaints, which may include verbal abuse, inappropriate searches or any conduct against a prisoner of a nature likely to bring discredit onthe Prison Service. Category C may include complaints about visits, phone calls, reception issues. Category D complaints can be made against professionals which include medical personnel and solicitors. Category E can be made by visitors to the prison.</p><p>Work is continuing on the completion of the necessary actions to introduce the new Prisoner Complaints System. This includes the drafting of the Statutory Instrument and the roll out of necessary training for Irish Prison Service staff. There is currently no mechanism in place to appeal an outcome of a complaint but this facility will be available for prisoners in the new complaints process. Unfortunately, it is the case that the impact of the Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions have delayed the completion of this work. My Officials continue to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to completing work on the Statutory Instrument which will give legal effect to the new Prisoner Complaints System. </p><p>The Dochas Centre has a bed capacity of 146 female prisoners. The average number in Custody in 2020 was 120. The figures sought by the Deputy are set out in the tables below: </p><p><b>Category A - Complaints Dochas 2018-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>CATEGORY</th>       <th>Number</th>       <th>Outcome</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>A </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>0 Upheld </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>A </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>1 Upheld </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>A </td>       <td>8 *</td>       <td>0 Upheld </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 &ndash; ( June 2021) </td>       <td>A </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>Incomplete as of yet </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* 4 complaints related to one incident and were investigated together.</p><p><b>Table 2 - Categories B-F Complaints Dochas 2018-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th></th>       <th>Category B</th>       <th>Category C </th>       <th>Category D</th>       <th>Category E</th>       <th>Category F</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td></td>       <td>18 complaints</td>       <td>62 complaints</td>       <td>6 complaints</td>       <td>2 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td></td>       <td>10 complaints</td>       <td>41 complaints</td>       <td>3 complaints</td>       <td>1 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td></td>       <td>25 complaints</td>       <td>25 complaints</td>       <td>7 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (end April 2021)</td>       <td></td>       <td>6 complaints</td>       <td>7 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>       <td>0 complaints</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>These complaints were not upheld.  </p><p>The Prison Service is acutely aware of the fact that women prisoners are a vulnerable group within the prison system and is aware that the supports for female offenders and their rehabilitative needs are very different to male offenders. The Deputy will wish to be aware that staff working with female offenders are provided with bespoke training and in February 2020 the Prison Service introduced a new tailored programme for staff to address the special needs of women prisoners called &lsquo;Working with Women in Custody&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Next week, Government will give consideration to whether this further easing can proceed as planned. </p>  <p>  A further easing is envisaged in August, again subject to the epidemiological situation at the time, which would see maximum attendance at wedding receptions or celebrations increase to 100. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;vaccine bonus/dividend&rdquo; provisions currently in place are guided by public health advice and are specifically focused on social visits to private homes to alleviate the impacts of social isolation. Since 10 May, those that are fully vaccinated may visit with other fully vaccinated people, providing there is no more than 3 households present and those that are fully vaccinated may visit with unvaccinated people from a single household if they are not at risk of severe illness and there is no more than 3 households present. </p>  <p>  While there is now scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines. </p></reply>

Pension abatement applies across the public service and is intended to ensure that a former public servant who is in receipt of a public service pension and who is appointed to a position, the remuneration for which is paid by a public service body, receives no more in combined pension and remuneration (including allowances) following employment post-retirement than he/she would have received in pensionable remuneration if he/she had not retired from the civil or public service. </p>  <p>  The practice goes as far back as the Superannuation Act 1834. The application of abatement was widened in 2012 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, insofar as it may now be applied in respect of any public service employment.  </p>  <p>  This extension of pension abatement is provided for in section 52 of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.  </p>  <p>  The legislation also allows the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to remove any doubt or question arising in the application of abatement, and to waive the abatement provision in certain circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Abatement of pension under the legislation applies to public service pensions, and then only in those cases where the public service pensioner obtains public service employment following retirement. This means that abatement does not apply to pensions in cases where public service pensioners secure employment, following retirement in an organisation that is not a public service body.  </p></reply>

Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.</p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 213 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021. The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

The HRB invests in data, research and evidence to deliver on the complementary objectives of improving people&rsquo;s health, delivering significant transformation in health policy and practice and supporting economic and social development. The focus of HRB investment is on patient oriented and clinical research, population health sciences, and health services research.</p><p>Health research is key to achieving the objectives of the health system. It delivers knowledge, insights and evidence to address key challenges in our society. It can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of our health services and enhance the quality of life of people throughout our society. Research enables us to develop more effective preventative strategies, better health care practices and treatments, improved models of care and more efficient ways to use human, infrastructural and financial resources.</p><p>The details provided below relate to HRB returns to DBEI (Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation) in respect of HRB expenditure (revenue and capital) for the above activities in 2019 and 2020, in line with the HRB Strategy 2016-2020. The breakdown below includes investment categorised in the report as &ldquo;health services&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo;. The &ldquo;health services&rdquo; figure relates to support for R&amp;amp;D which takes places in Irish higher education institutions, hospitals and other research performing organisations in Ireland. The smaller &ldquo;other&rdquo; figure relates to expenditure towards a number of EU Joint programmes. The expenditure is broken down based on the focus and enabler areas set out in the HRB Strategy (2016-2020).</p><p><i>Note</i>: The total figure for 2020 below is larger than that estimated at time of submission to DBEI (by approx. &euro;1.35M) as this reflects actual expenditure at end 2020 and includes additional investment by the HRB in support of the Government&rsquo;s response to COVID-19. The Covid-19 pandemic presented a unique set of challenges to our health system, society, and economy, and required a multifaceted and agile response and the capacity to make well informed decisions in real time. The HRB responded by redirecting available funding to COVID-19 priorities and by taking on a number of additional tasks. Examples include: </p><p>- the provision of evidence reviews to inform public policy responses nationally and globally; </p><p>- funding of research projects into medical, social and policy countermeasures, health service readiness, and patient safety projects, aligned with the WHO R&amp;amp;D Roadmap;</p><p>- enabling Ireland&rsquo;s participation in multinational clinical trials to evaluate potential treatments such as the WHO SOLIDARITY Trial; </p><p>- working with the Department and CSO to facilitate access to the CSO Covid-19 data hub for research purposes; and </p><p>- establishing a national Covid-19 research ethics committee on behalf of the Minister to expedite ethics reviews of Covid-19-related research projects.</p><p>The HRB continues to support the national and global response to COVID-19 and further details of the HRB current and planned activities can be found in the HRB Strategy (2021-2025), <i>Health research - making an impact</i>, which I launched earlier this (www.hrb.ie/strategy-2025).</p><p><b>Focus Area 1: Address major health challenges (Innovative, investigator-led and internationally competitive research to address major health challenges in society</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health Research Charities Ireland (HRCI) contribution </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>297,482 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Research Charities Group/HRB Joint funding scheme </td>       <td>1,006,393 </td>       <td>354,263 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HRB Health Research Awards </td>       <td>2,463,722 </td>       <td>472,254 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investigator Led Projects </td>       <td>4,876,649 </td>       <td>2,055,843 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SFI-HRB-Wellcome Research Partnership </td>       <td>1,615,569 </td>       <td>1,737,954 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>US Ireland Research &amp;amp;

Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of contract for substantial enabling works. </p>  <p>  The ownership and governance arrangements are more complex. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  The draft legal framework subsequently developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements. It provides that the new hospital remains in State ownership and that thus, the State&rsquo;s significant investment will be protected.  The clear legal advice provided to the State is that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital. The Sisters of Charity will not play any role in the governance or operation of the new NMH. In May 2017, the Sisters announced their decision to end their involvement and transfer their shareholding in SVHG to a new charitable entity, St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG.</p>  <p>  We will continue to examine all options carefully as we move forward towards finalisation of the arrangements. I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be put beyond doubt.</p>  <p>  In that context, I intend to engage further with both St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity over the coming days and weeks.</p></reply>

My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  In addition, the position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

My Department is currently working on the details of this allocation with the HSE.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a firm commitment to progress the review and update of the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy, and this is a priority for me, as Minister for Health. Consideration will need to be given by the Department of Health with regard to the approach to the update, including the convening of a steering group and the breadth of stakeholder consultation. Meetings have taken place between the Department of Health and representative organisations in relation to the carers strategy and work will progress on this in 2021.</p></reply>

Approvals have now issued to 4,926 farmers for support to undertake environmental commitments to increase the environmental value of their farm features. This figure is more than double the original participation figure envisioned and there are no plans to increase the figure further.</p>  <p>  As REAP was oversubscribed, a ranking and selection process was used to assess applications. This process considered the presence of priority water areas (as defined by the EPA) and the proportion of Natura and ANC land on the holding. The details of the selection process is outlined in section 10 of the REAP terms and conditions. </p>  <p>  Applicants have a right to request a review of the decision to be declined entry to REAP, similar to other Department decisions, if they feel that decision was incorrect.  Such review requests must set out the reason why the decision is considered to be incorrect. Full details of this option and contact details are included in correspondence that has issued directly to the farmers concerned. </p></reply>

(Circular 10 of 2010 - Changes to Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes 2011)</p>  <p>  Unenclosed land is, in general, less fertile and more exposed than enclosed land and trees planted on unenclosed land generally do not perform as well as trees planted on soil types associated with enclosed land.</p>  <p>  Prior to the decision to restrict planting of unenclosed land, a number of well-known studies supported the position that habitat types associated with unenclosed land are more environmentally sensitive than enclosed land.</p>  <p>  At the time, another consideration was the fact that many plantations on unenclosed land that received grant and premium aid failed which required the Department to recoup the monies paid.  This was a difficult process for the applicants and the Department.</p>  <p>  Concerns also existed in relation to the importance of unenclosed land for foraging and breeding by a wide range of protected bird species (e.g. Hen harrier).  Similarly, concerns existed in relation to undesignated Annex 1 habitats such as wet and dry heath, and highly endangered protected species such as freshwater pearl mussel, whose life cycle is dependent on natural habitats typically associated with unenclosed land.  Such environmental issues were discussed at this time with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Hen harrier, Freshwater Pearl mussel, Breeding waders including Curlew and High Nature Value farmland remain key concerns of the Commission in relation to Ireland's afforestation programme.</p>  <p>  The planting on unenclosed land will be reviewed in the context of Project Woodland by Working Group 4.</p></reply>

As previously outlined, the decision to move to the 15 km was based on a number of factors including the advice from environmental consultants, NPWS, feedback from the FAC and industry standards in other sectors. </p>  <p>  Almost all applications for forestry licensing have at least one European site within 15 kilometres.  However, what is important is what sites are screened in and what sites are screened out.  Some projects may have many sites within 15 kilometres but the screening rules for the qualifying interests of those sites allows for those sites to be screened out and barring any other issue the file can be approved without an appropriate assessment.  Most European sites within 15 kilometres of a forestry project are screened out due to the screening rules that apply.  It is therefore not the buffer distance of 15 kilometres that screens sites in, it is the screening rules. </p>  <p>  A significant amount of sites are screened in, not because of the 15 kilometre buffer but because of the compliance with European and National Case law in relation to the consideration of mitigation at screening stage.  This is a legal requirement that has to be met and compliance with the law could not be suspended until additional resources were in place.</p>  <p>  In relation to an examination with Northern Ireland, Scotland and other countries, I understand that a comparison of the licensing of forestry operations in other Countries will be carried out in the context of the work of Working Group 4 in Project Woodland.</p></reply>

These were in relation to increasing the zone of influence for consideration of appropriate assessment from 3 km to 15 km and to implement European and National Case law in relation to the consideration of mitigation at screening stage. It is well known that these substantive changes resulted in delays in the processing of licences and in a backlog of applications. We have invested heavily in ecology resources and training in order to service these new requirements, and have been engaged in a process of continuous improvement, including streamlining of procedures, so that output may improve. These measures are now taking effect, with 1,594 licences issued to date this year which is 27% up on the same time last year.</p>  <p>  There is a still a great deal of work to do as there are 5,978 forestry licence applications on hand. Not all of these could be considered to be in backlog, as this figure for instance  includes 1,724 outstanding from the batch application of 1,864 licences received from Coillte in mid-March </p>  <p>  In this regard, Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has been set up with the objective of reviewing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, as well as the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy.</p>  <p>  Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly.  The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system.  The Forestry Policy Group which meets this week will receive a full update on progress to date.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, we have set ourselves a target of issuing 4,500 licences this year which is a 75% increase on last year and I remain hopeful that we will reach this target.</p></reply>

This is open to all registered beekeepers and is a mechanism that can assist beekeepers invest in their apiaries and associated apiculture equipment for the future. Registration requirements for such producers are on the Department's website.</p><p>Under this scheme, aid at a rate of 40% is payable on the accepted cost of approved capital investments or equipment. The 2022 scheme is due to open in October 2021.  Details of the 2021 scheme and eligibility requirements can be found at .</p><p>In relation to land available for biodiversity and pollinators there are no direct supports available. The current agri-environmental scheme GLAS has actions for wild bees as well as general biodiversity actions which support pollinators such as hedge planting and wild bird cover. The agri-environmental scheme for the next CAP is under development and pollinator actions are being developed in consultation with experts. The next agri-environmental scheme is due to open in 2023. </p><p>The Department recognises the important role of pollinators and the role farmland and agriculture has to play. With a third of Ireland's Bee species under threat of extinction, it has never been more important to take action to protect pollinators and the Department plays an active role in supporting many initiatives and projects which work to raise awareness, encourage action and undertake research on our pollinators. </p><p>The All Ireland Pollinator Plan is a hugely successful project which this Department has been involved with since its beginning in 2015. It provides a valuable resource on actions for all sectors from businesses to farmland to provide space where pollinators can survive and thrive. The AIPP has recently published its second plan which now includes a Farmland Pollinator Officer funded by the Department to further develop and promote ways in which farmland and farmers can support pollinators.

To 18<sup>th</sup>June, a total of 1,594 licences have issued, which is 27% ahead of the same period last year, accepting that last year was low in terms of licencing output.  In terms of timber volumes, the Department has issued licences for 3.14 million cubic metres. Overall, 971 tree felling licences have issued to date, of which 47% are private felling licences.  I expect to maintain this momentum for the rest of the year and to reach the target of issuing 4,500 licences, which is a 75% increase on last year&rsquo;s licencing output.</p><p>The number of tree felling licences on hand on 18<sup>th</sup>June, was 4,521, which includes 1,724 outstanding from the batch application of 1,864 licences received from Coillte in mid-March. The average length of time to decision for felling licences for those decided in 2021 is 12 months. It is ten months for afforestation and nine months for roads. </p><p>The number of outstanding forestry licences appeals with the operationally independent Forestry Appeals Committee is set out in the table below, broken down by licence type and county.
