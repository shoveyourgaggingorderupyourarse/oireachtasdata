    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-10a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101000075#WRA00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 30 together.</p>  <p>  As I have previously informed the House, my Department has recently received the submission of a final tender from the bidder in the National Broadband Plan procurement process. This is a significant milestone and brings Ireland a step closer to realising the ambitious goals of the NBP, which is to bring a high speed broadband connection to every premises in the country.</p>  <p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. Evaluation of the final tender submission is ongoing and will be allowed the time required.  On conclusion of the evaluation, my Department will make a recommendation to me on whether to appoint the bidder as preferred bidder and I will bring the matter to Government for decision.  </p>  <p>There are just over 101,000 premises in Co Donegal.  Commercial operators are providing, or have indicated plans to provide high speed broadband to approximately 61,600 of these premises.  eir has plans to deliver access to high speed broadband to a further 5,000 premises in Donegal as part of  its ongoing rural fibre deployment.</p>  <p>  The remaining approximately 34,400 premises, some 33% of all premises in Donegal, will be included in the network to be built under the National Broadband Plan State led intervention.</p>  <p>  This Government has set the bar high through its ambitious National Broadband Plan. Commercial operators have reacted to Government setting out its aim that every premises in Ireland would have access to a high speed broadband network. When this Government came into office in 2016, only 48% of premises in Donegal had access to a high speed broadband service. Today, 61% of premises in Donegal have access to a high speed broadband service and this is set to increase in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s objective for the NBP are being realised through a combination of commercial investment and the State intervention. The commitment by Government has acted as a catalyst in encouraging very significant investment by commercial operators in deployment of high speed broadband networks.</p>  <p>  In addition to the eir rural fibre deployment, other commercial operators are investing significantly in rolling out high speed broadband infrastructure throughout Ireland. For example, SIRO has committed &euro;450 million to providing fibre broadband to 500,000 regional homes and businesses in 51 towns across Ireland, including in County Donegal. SIRO currently offers high speed broadband services in Letterkenny and has plans for  Ballybofey, Ballyshannon, Buncrana, Bundoran and Donegal Town.</p></reply>

Despite starting from the fifth lowest level of renewable energy sources in our energy  mix in the 2005 reference year, very considerable progress has been made with the SEAI&rsquo;s most recent projections indicating  an outturn in the range of 90% of the target likely to be achieved. In terms of the Electricity component of the overall target, latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that 30.1% of our electricity came from renewable sources in 2017.</p><p>Electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2017.  The following table sets out the contributions from the different renewable energy sources in the period referred to in the Question. <table><tr><th>Renewables Electricity %</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Hydro (normalised)</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Wind (normalised)</td><td>21.3</td><td>22.0</td><td>25.2</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass</td><td>1</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Landfill Gas</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Biogas</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Solar</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Renewables Electricity (overall)</td><td>25.2</td><td>26.8</td><td>30.1</td></tr></table></p><p>Provisional figures for 2018 up to the end of August show that wind generation has increased by 6.6% while overall electricity demand increased by 2.4%.  Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 6% of renewable electricity in 2017.<font color="#1F497D"> </font>Approximately 14% of the biomass used for electricity generation in 2017 was imported. </p><p>The Government has also adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  In addition, the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), approved by Government in July, is designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. It is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under the RESS in 2019.</p><p>I also launched a Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) this year, which is open to all non-domestic heat users not operating in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The purpose of the scheme is to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the heating sector.  </p><p>Moreover, the Government has committed significant funding to support electric vehicles through the National Development Plan which includes an allocation of &euro;200 million for the period 2018-2027. This year, there has been 1,686 new electric vehicles sold, which represents a 135% increase on the same point in 2017.</p><p>In April 2018, in order to provide certainty to obligated parties, a policy statement on the Biofuel Obligation Scheme was published. This policy statement set out an increase in the obligation to 10% from 1 January 2019, which has already been given effect to by way of a Statutory Instrument, and to 11% from 1 January 2020.</p><p>In July, my Department published a National Policy Statement on Electricity Interconnection designed to enhance security of supply in Ireland. Work is underway on a proposed 700MW HVDC electricity interconnector between Ireland and France and the Greenlink Interconnector which is a 500MW HVDC interconnector between Wexford and Pembroke in Wales.</p><p>Finally, the SEAI has indicated that the use of renewables in electricity generation in 2017 avoided &euro;276 million in fossil fuel imports.</p></reply>

In addition, the Assembly also recommended that the State should review and revise regulations and supports for land use diversification for example in relation to supports for planting forests in accordance with best environmental practice and encouraging organic farming.  </p>  <p>  The report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly was submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas in April of this year, and the Houses subsequently established the Joint Committee on Climate Action to further consider the recommendations and report by the end of January 2019. </p>  <p>  In the context of the consideration of each of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly it is now a matter for the Joint Committee to consider whether and how each recommendation might be taken up by Government. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Committee is engaging with each Government Department, at Secretary General level, on their respective policies in place and position in response to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly. In relation to the specific recommendations referred to, the Deputy will be aware that matters relating to taxation policy are the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and matters relating to forestry policy are for the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overall role that forestry has to play in the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s long-term decarbonisation objectives, the National Policy Position sets out a long-term objective for Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture and land use sector entailing an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Further analysis is now under way, led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to consider how this objective can be further articulated and the long-term implications for its achievement. Notwithstanding this ongoing work, I consider it absolutely essential that the State continues to support sustained high rates of annual afforestation into the future to secure the long-term sequestration benefits of forestry in support of the National Policy Position for 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Policy Position is also in line with the Paris Agreement, which recognises the importance of land use activities in mitigation efforts by Parties, including the need to address emissions associated with agricultural activities and deforestation and the role that can be played by the sector in contributing to sequestration of greenhouse gases. The implications of the Paris Agreement objectives for the land use sector will be the subject of a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to be published in 2019, which will address sustainable land management, food security and greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-10a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101000075#WRA01400"><p>I am fully cognisant of the urgent, global challenge of climate change and its effects, particularly those experienced in the developing countries. The publication on Monday of the IPCC Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5⁰C highlights in stark terms the urgency of managing our global trajectory of emissions. The scale and complexity of this challenge demands a coordinated approach at both national and international levels. Ireland is committed to concerted multilateral action to tackle climate change through the Paris Agreement and to working with our EU and global partners in achieving the objectives of the Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to hold the g<font color="#222222">lobal average temperature increase to well below 2 &deg;C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 &deg;C.</font></p><p>The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the Agreement. Ireland will contribute via the NDC submitted by the EU on behalf of its Member States, and which commits the EU to a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In this context, the EU has undertaken to reduce emissions in sectors covered by the Emissions Trading System (ETS)  by 43%, and has agreed binding annual targets for each Member State for those emissions falling outside the ETS. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. </p><p>Ireland's National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, sets out the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February 2018 of the National Development Plan, will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.</p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. This Statement also serves as a progress report on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan. </p><p>I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  I propose to initiate shortly the process of updating the current Plan in order to facilitate the detailed policy design required to realise the high-level of ambition articulated in the National Development Plan as well as to develop further cost-effective policy options to address Ireland's targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. This process will also be informed by Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan, and by a new long-term low emissions strategy, both of which Ireland must prepare and finalise by the end of 2019 under the EU Clean Energy Package. I intend that the long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position.</p><p>In line with the decision of the European Council of October 2014 on the EU's overall commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, Ireland has fully supported this level of ambition in recent negotiations to reform the EU ETS and to put in place Member State targets for non-ETS sectors under the EU Effort Sharing regulation. In addition, Ireland has also supported the high ambition for the proposals under the EU Clean Energy Package, while seeking to ensure that individual requirements on EU Member States would be fair, affordable and technically achievable. </p><p>Ireland also continues to support high ambition in ongoing negotiations at EU level in relation to emissions standards for both Light- and Heavy Duty Vehicles. I consider it essential that the EU seek the maximum possible ambition within these proposals which will contribute to enabling EU Member States, through strong, effective EU regulation, to meeting their respective targets for 2030.</p><p>Collectively, high ambition in all of the EU&rsquo;s sectoral policies and targets for 2030 may enable the EU to achieve emissions reductions in excess of those already committed to by EU Heads of State and Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-10a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101000075#WRA01600"><p>The National Development Plan 2018 -2027 recognises that improving the energy efficiency of the built environment is a central plank of Ireland&rsquo;s action on climate change. Energy efficiency will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion, business competitiveness and better public services, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Exchequer investment of &euro;4 billion, along with taxation and regulatory measures, are provided for under the NDP to drive the step change in energy performance in the residential sector.</p>  <p>  Currently Government is funding just under 30,000 home energy efficiency upgrades per annum to an average BER of C. The NDP ambition is to increase grant supported energy efficient renovations to circa 45,000 to a BER of B from 2021.</p>  <p>  A number of actions which are outlined in the National Mitigation Plan and Long Term Renovation Strategy are already underway to achieve these levels of retrofit and promote deep retrofit of buildings across all building types and tenure. Those actions which relate specifically to homes are as follows:</p>  <p>- The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures such as insulation, heating controls and solar thermal technology. I recently expanded this scheme to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by providing a grant for heat pumps and increasing the funding for external insulation.</p>  <p>- The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. I recently announced the expansion of the scheme to include internal and external wall insulation in order to increase the number of people that can receive upgrades and increase the energy savings and emissions reductions the scheme can achieve by enabling fuel switching.</p>  <p>- The Better Energy Communities scheme allows groups of buildings to apply for funding to improve their energy efficiency. This scheme has resulted in innovative approaches to renovation being developed, while also contributing to the overall reduction of energy usage and emissions from our building stock.</p>  <p>  To build on what has been achieved through these schemes, and understand how we make the step change necessary to achieve the NDP ambition, we already gathering the real world evidence through two flagship projects, both of which follow international best practice:</p>  <p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme, which began in 2017 and will conclude at the end of 2019, is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit. This will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.</p>  <p>- The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, funded by my Department, is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health, and is operated by SEAI and the HSE. It began in 2016 and this first phase will conclude at the end of this year. It is measuring the health and wellbeing impacts associated with improved energy efficiency. Not only is this evidence needed to make a robust business case for further public investment, it is critical for how we communicate the benefits of climate action. Increasing public understanding of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency is critical to motivate people to invest in, and make their contribution to, action on climate change.</p>  <p>  While it is necessary to tailor offerings for the different circumstances of householders, the common goal of these actions is to drive the step change we need in energy performance, skills, capacity and investment, and understand how we build demand, grow the supply chain and offer attractive financing to leverage public investment and empower citizens to act on climate change.</p></reply>

These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.   While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p>  <p>  In parallel, I am putting in place a number of additional measures to seek to close the gap to compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s targets under both the Effort Sharing Decision and the Renewable Energy Directive. </p>  <p>  In relation to biofuels, in May of this year, I signed an order increasing the obligation rate of fuel suppliers from the current level of 8% by volume to a level of 10% by volume which will come into effect from 1 January 2019. I intend to further increase this obligation to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020 and also carry out a public consultation next year in relation to further increases in the post-2020 period.  </p>  <p>  In order to promote further penetration of electric vehicles, I have secured Government support to expand the range of measures in place drive the electrification of transport, adding home charger support, Benefit in kind enhancement, toll reduction and support to the taxi/hackney sector.</p>  <p>  I opened the first phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat for applications on 12 September.  This phase provides a grant of up to 30% of the installation cost of a heat pump system in non-domestic applications.  </p>  <p>  I launched the first call for applications for the Climate Action Fund on 9 July. This is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and it will have an allocation of at least &euro;500 million over the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  I secured Government approval in July for the high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The new Scheme has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The first RESS auction will deliver &lsquo;shovel ready&rsquo; projects, reducing the gap to 2020 and assisting in the early delivery for our trajectory to 2030. </p>  <p>  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that at the absolute very least we meet our 2030 target. </p>  <p>To achieve this 2030 target, Ireland may need to avail of flexibility options built into the ESR agreement, including provision to transfer allowances from the ETS to the non-ETS sector and provision to take account of emissions credits attributable to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities.</p></reply>

In that context, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an ongoing basis so that all steps are being taken to ensure the system is working as effectively as possible. Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspections and appointment of additional temporary inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilised to enhance sales and improve compliance rates. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval last year to draft a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009, including amendments for the tendering of TV Licence fee collection.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments were considered under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and I received their report on March 8th. The Bill is currently being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel and is included as a priority on the Government's Legislative Programme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, I requested the Committee to examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media and the Committee published their report at the end of November 2017.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of the recommendations made in that report, Government approval was received in July 2018 to establish a Working Group on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting.  The Working Group will examine a number of options to support future funding and the reform of television licence collection and it is intended that it will report to me in Quarter 1 2019.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.

Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that, at the absolute very least, we meet our 2030 target. </p>  <p>  To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Plan very explicitly defined the scale of the challenge Ireland faces in decarbonising its economy and acknowledged that it was a first step and not a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050. Rather it began the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. The Plan is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; which is being implemented and updated on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society.

The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  I propose to initiate shortly the process of updating the current Plan in order to facilitate the detailed policy design required to realise the high-level of ambition articulated in the National Development Plan as well as to develop further cost-effective policy options to address Ireland's targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. This process will also be informed by Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan, and by a new long-term low emissions strategy, both of which Ireland must prepare and finalise by the end of 2019 under the EU Clean Energy Package. I intend that the long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position.</p>  <p>  I propose also to respond formally to the recommendations set out in the Council&rsquo;s 2018 Annual Review in the context of the 2018 Annual Transition Statement, which I expect to be in a position to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and I am fully committed to ensuring that a sustainable post office network is available to all our citizens for the medium and for the long term.</p><p>As a result of various actions taken by Government in the last two years, An Post has been able to construct and begin implementing a strategic plan for a sustainable future. There is widespread acceptance that the post office network requires modernisation to build, to maintain and to protect a service that meetings the needs of communities across the country. As part of its strategic plan, An Post is implementing a renewed vision for the post office network which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. Such services include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. Investment of &euro;50 million in the network, which is equivalent to &euro;45,000 per post office, is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p><p>As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.  Additional services that An Post propose to introduce through the network include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities. Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. <font color="#222222">A new partnership between Avantcard and An Post will also see personal loan services available in every post office across the country and the creation of new jobs. </font>An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it.</p><p>Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices.</p><p>While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there will always be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as an 'offline gateway' for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out a pilot scheme for Digital Assist, which I launched last week, which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government transactions.</p></reply>

The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020 for these non-ETS sectors. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their levels in 2005. </p>  <p>  For the period to 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets out binding annual emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will require a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. </p>  <p>  Both the Effort Sharing Decision and Effort Sharing Regulation incorporate a number of mechanisms that provide some flexibility to Member States in the achievement of their annual targets. These include provisions to bank or to carry forward allowances from earlier or future years or to purchase allowances from other Member States. These mechanisms are essential to take account of inter-annual fluctuations in greenhouse gas emissions, notwithstanding the objective to reduce overall emissions over time. </p>  <p>  A number of further mitigation options are built into the ESR for all Member States, including provision to transfer allowances from the ETS to the non-ETS sector and provision to take account of emissions credits attributable to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. </p>  <p>  The latest available projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in May 2018, indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s effective emissions budget for the 2021 to 2030 period for non-ETS sectors, arising from the ESR annual ceilings, will be 380.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. </p>  <p>  In light of the fact that key emitting sectors are already subject to effective carbon budgets, either at EU level or Member State level as set out above, I have no plans to introduce an alternative carbon budget along the lines described by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which entered into force on 9 July 2018, sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in non-ETS emissions (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. </p>  <p>  Ireland's National Mitigation Plan (NMP), published in 2017, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan sets out the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. Building on the NMP, the publication in February 2018 of the National Development Plan (NDP), will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Energy White Paper presents a long-term strategic vision that is intended to guide the direction of energy policy from now until 2030. The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period. </p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Good progress has been made to date, but the target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.  Latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, with an expectation that Ireland will achieve a range of  potentially up to 90% by 2020. The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided &euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Government has also adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  In addition, my Department is developing the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030; and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), the purpose of which is to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the heating sector.</p></reply>

The 2015 Energy White Paper<i>Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future</i>sets out a road-map for Ireland to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050. The strategy is clear that non-renewable energy sources will make a significant &ndash; though progressively smaller &ndash; contribution to our energy mix over the course of the energy transition. The National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.</p><p>During this transition, gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply. Natural Gas has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels.  In Ireland gas powered generation provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation.</p></reply>

During this period, the focus of this priority for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) has been the roll out of the household food waste bin. From their inception in 2016, the WERLAs have coordinated local authority actions by way of compliance assistance and enforcement to support the effective roll out of the household food waste bin in the required agglomerations in accordance with the legislation, and this work is on-going. The provision of a brown bin collection service, where it is technically and environmentally practical to do so, continues to be monitored by my Department, together with the regulatory authorities and industry representatives.</p>  <p>  With respect to the household collection model and structure, the CCPC, in its report, acknowledged the work of the Price Monitoring Group (PMG), which I established in July 2017, to monitor prices for consumers offered by the waste sector as flat fees were being phased out. It has confirmed that consumers have seen price stability across the sector over the last 12 months with no evidence of price gouging. </p>  <p>  The findings of this report also support the approach that I have taken to introduce an incentivised pricing model, rather than a blanket pay-by-kilogramme system as previously proposed. The report shows that household waste collection costs are on average between 63 and 77 cents per day.</p>  <p>  The CCPC does not call for a one-size-fits-all type of regulatory approach. In fact, it advises that, based on data collection and consultation, different competition models can be introduced for different geographic areas. The CCPC&rsquo;s findings also state that the current regulatory system needs to be developed to address market structure, customer needs, and environmental targets.</p>  <p>  The nature of the market is complex, as both the CCPC and the PMG have identified. Therefore, the findings of this CCPC report must be studied with care and diligence to ensure that consumer wellbeing is protected and that our environmental goals are met. This will require extensive work to be done in relation to data gathering and analysis before any decisions are made in relation to changes to the market structures. This may be a role for a national regulatory authority, as suggested in the CCPC report. The hybrid model suggested could also help to extend the coverage of door-to-door collections nationwide, while ensuring better value for money for the householder and providing certainty for investment by the waste sector.</p>  <p>  This report, combined with the on-going work of the PMG, and the finalisation of the European Circular Economy waste legislation framework, will inform the development of a future waste management policy, including our environmental goals, regulatory and market structures, and policy instruments and tools.</p></reply>

To avoid confusion, recommendation 6 refers to ownership of projects by communities and citizens and not public or state ownership.   This recommendation is largely reflective of the ambition laid out in the 2015 Energy White Paper, the development of which revealed a strong citizen and community desire to be consulted on, and participate in, Ireland&rsquo;s energy transition and the development of energy-related projects.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 also aligns with the policy objectives which have shaped the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), the high level design for which was approved by Government in July. As well as delivering Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to an EU-wide binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, broadening the mix of renewable technologies and enhancing security of energy supply, the new RESS will deliver on the commitment to increase community and citizen participation in, and benefit from, renewable electricity projects.</p>  <p>  Communities have been designed into the fabric of the new scheme, and key to the delivery of this ambition will be the development of an enabling framework for community participation. Two specific measures to be developed as part of the implementation of RESS include: mandatory investment opportunities for communities and citizens in developer-led projects; and financial and technical support for community-led projects including delivery of key capacity building measures. This broadly aligns with the Citizens Assembly recommendations.</p></reply>

The NBP is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State intervention.  Today, over 7 out of 10 premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.</p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. Evaluation of the final tender submission is ongoing and will be allowed the time required.  On conclusion of the evaluation, my Department will make a recommendation to me on whether to appoint the bidder as preferred bidder and I will bring the matter to Government for decision.  </p><p>There are just over 91,000 premises in Co Kildare.  Commercial operators are providing, or have indicated plans to provide high speed broadband to approximately 76,000 of these premises.  eir has plans to deliver access to high speed broadband to a further 1,400 premises in Kildare as part of  its ongoing rural fibre deployment. </p><p>The remaining approximately 13,600 premises, some 15% of all premises in Kildare, will be included in the network to be built under the National Broadband Plan State led intervention.</p><p>When this Government came into office in 2016, 75% of premises in Kildare had access to a high speed broadband service. Today, 84% of premises in Kildare have access to a high speed broadband service and this is set to increase in the months ahead.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

These were considered by Government last week and are available on my Department's website. One considers the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the NSIC, while the second addresses comparative international practice and approaches to compensation of property owners in proximity to high-voltage lines.</p>  <p>  On the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding, the report concludes that from a techno-economic point of view, an Alternating Current Overhead Line is the most beneficial way of meeting the need for enhanced power transfer capability between Ireland and Northern Ireland. An overhead line provides the opportunity for investment along the route of the line and offers a far more balanced electricity network across this country and across this island.</p>  <p>  On the report into the comparative international practice in relation to compensation, that report indicates that Ireland has a comparatively generous compensation regime in place.</p>  <p>  In addition to publishing the reports on my Department's website, I have forwarded copies of the two Reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></reply>

It is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. Under the current Oireachtas Committee formations, the CRU is responsible to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment where these matters are discussed as the Committee sees fit.</p>  <p>  Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.</p>  <p>  One of Commission&rsquo;s statutory functions is to carry out market monitoring to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition. As part of its market monitoring work, CRU last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive. </p>  <p>  Recent announcements regarding electricity price increases reflect that since the final quarter of 2016, average international natural gas prices have increased sharply. They have, more or less, continued to rise through 2017 and on to Quarter 3 2018, with day ahead prices in August  being 50% higher than 12 months earlier. Consistent with the upward international gas price trend, average wholesale electricity prices have increased in like manner. After an initial delay, the effect of this protracted rise in the wholesale electricity price since end 2016 has been observed in the retail market, with all significant Irish electricity suppliers announcing household customer price increases.</p>  <p>  Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which I, as Minister, may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;. The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia restrictions, timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas. Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which Member States must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package.  A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered.</p></reply>

As Ireland already operates 9% and 13.5% reduced VAT rates, it is not legally possible to introduce a third VAT rate at 5%.  However, it is possible under Annex III of the VAT Directive to apply a reduced VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% to non-oral pharmaceutical products.  </p>  <p>  In order for a zero rate of VAT to be applied to a good or service, that good or service must have applied at the zero rate on 1 January 1991 and have continued to apply at that rate since. No new items may be charged at the zero rate, where they had not been subject to the zero rate before 1991. In Ireland the zero VAT rate applies to oral medicines, including oral medicines for animals, as they were subject to the zero rate on and since 1 January 1991.  However, non-oral animal medicines were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, so it is not legally possible to apply the zero rate to them now.  </p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive, Ireland has scope to potentially reduce the rate of VAT on non-oral animal medicines from 23% to a reduced rate. However, such a reduction would have a limited benefit to the farming community, as VAT-registered farmers are entitled to full VAT deductibility on their input costs while unregistered farmers are compensated for their VAT input costs through the flat rate addition they receive on payments for supplies of agricultural produce and services.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that its criterion to be considered a HWI and come within the management of the HWI Units of its Large Cases Division is individuals with net assets of over &euro;50 million. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of their net worth on returns of income. Accordingly, Revenue does not have the data required to estimate the number of individuals with a net worth within the thresholds requested. </p><p>Revenue has had a focus on High Wealth Individuals (HWIs) over a long period. HWIs have been managed by dedicated units within its Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003. Revenue has recently split its Large Cases Division into two divisions, one of which will now focus on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. The new Division is in the process, as reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), of reviewing the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs managed in the Division. The allocation of resources is a matter for Revenue but I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment, of which the setting up of the new Large Cases Division is a part, is being supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base. I also understand that Revenue is also establishing a new Division, the Medium Enterprises Division, to manage the affairs of the tier of cases, both corporate and individuals below the Large Cases Division. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the case base of the dedicated units within its Large Cases Division is adjusted periodically but not necessarily on an annual basis. The following Table provides the number of HWIs managed in the Division for the years indicated:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of HWIs</th></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>571</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>480</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that cases not previously or currently meeting the criteria for inclusion in its Large Cases Division were and are subject to ongoing risk evaluation and, where necessary, intervention programmes. Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following appraisal of the risk factors in each case. This applies to all taxpayers including those not within the responsibility of Large Cases Division. </p><p>I am satisfied that the structural realignment being advanced by Revenue combined with the use by Revenue of the powers available to them will continue to deliver an outcome where HWIs pay the appropriate tax in accordance with the legislation.  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to estimate additional audit yield related to cases not currently within the responsibility of Revenue&rsquo;s LCD. However, Revenue has pointed out that in the first instance there is a presumption of honesty regarding the behaviour of taxpayers who pay on a self-assessment basis and no category of taxpayer would be regarded, in advance of a case appraisal, as likely to give rise to audit yield. Secondly, all taxpayers are subject to risk evaluation and intervention as appropriate so bringing a particular category of taxpayers within the remit of the Large Cases Division would not, of itself, be a determinant of an increased audit yield.  </p><p>Over the last number of Budgets/Estimates process I supported the business case put forward by Revenue in relation to additional resources, both personnel and ICT, and I will continue to examine any proposal put forward by Revenue in the future.</p></reply>

By contrast, a person can be refused the right of employment as a solicitor, for example, if they fail to hold a practicing certificate.&quot;</i></p><p>My position remains that, given the conclusion of the review, I have no plans to reintroduce such a relief.</p></reply>

The latest review was undertaken on behalf of the Central Statistics Office who are required to show the accrued liabilities of all funded and unfunded Irish pensions as part of the National Accounts, under EU Regulation 549 / 2013. Transmission of this data to the European Commission was mandatory from 2017, in respect of valuation year 2015, and at three yearly intervals from that date. The next valuation due is in respect of year-end 2018.</p><p>As such, the following is an estimate of the cost of accrued pension rights for serving employees in the civil service, the health sector, and the education sector as at 31 December 2015. The figures represent the present value of retirement benefits to be paid in the future on the basis of accrued pension rights of serving employees.<table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Accrued Liability as at 31 December 2015 - Serving Employees</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; Bn</td></tr><tr><td>Civil   Service</td><td>8.8</td></tr><tr><td>Health </td><td>12.2</td></tr><tr><td>Education*</td><td>17.3</td></tr></table></p><p><i>*There is no readily available breakdown of the cost of accrued pension rights for serving employees in the education sector between that corresponding to primary and secondary school teachers.</i></p><p>It is important to bear in mind that the accrued pension rights of serving civil servants will fall to be paid over the next 70 years or so; and not in any single year. </p><p>It is also important to stress that the government has taken a number of significant steps to improve the long-term sustainability of public service pensions in recent times.

The Bill is being treated as a priority and the intention is to secure enactment of the legislation as early as possible in the current term.</p>  <p>  Once the Bill is enacted and commenced, the majority of public servants recruited prior to 1 April 2004 will have a new compulsory retirement age of 70. For the most part, these public servants currently have a compulsory retirement age of 65.</p>  <p>  Until the commencement of the Bill, the current compulsory retirement age continues to apply and public servants reaching the age of 65 are required to retire.  To accommodate public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision to increase the retirement age and the commencement of the necessary legislation, I arranged for the introduction of interim arrangements.</p>  <p>  The interim arrangements must respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65. They provide a temporary solution to affected public servants by allowing them to be re-hired for a period of one year, until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (66).  Their new employment contracts make provision for this arrangement.</p>  <p>  The general policy across the public service is that, where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired. This practice is continuing in the context of the interim arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Once the Bill is commenced the practice of payment at the minimum point will not apply to public servants who choose to remain beyond the age of 65.  Those public servants will not be in the position of having retired and been re-hired. </p>  <p>  In a case where a public servant makes an application for the interim arrangements and the legislation referred to above is commenced before the individual reaches the age of 65, he/she will be covered by the proposed legislation. Public servants covered by the legislation, who reach the age of 65 after the date of its commencement, will be able to remain at work on current terms and conditions, including pay, up to the age of 70.</p></reply>

The service to date has been one to one coaching for principals only. DEIS schools will be prioritised for the extension of the coaching service to incorporate team coaching for the Principal and their leadership team, with up to four sessions being offered to 100 DEIS schools in the first instance.</p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the other supports recently introduced through the Centre for School Leadership including mentoring, a new postgraduate diploma in school leadership and the additional 3,000 middle management posts in schools.</p></reply>

It is in that context that I will formulate my specific budgetary priorities.  </p>  <p>  I have set 4 key areas where I am seeking to make improvements in order to meet our objective to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe: the quality of the learning experience; the capacity to meet the needs of those at a disadvantage or with special needs to fulfil their potential; the environment for schools to be innovative and continuously improve their capacity to serve their pupils' needs; and the collaboration and bridges which education and training institutions build with their wider communities to meet the changing needs of our country.  </p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 allows for a reduced class size in Urban Band 1 primary schools to accommodate class size of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage.  Under DEIS Plan 2017, there is a commitment to evaluate the level of teaching resources for schools participating in the School Support Programme to inform future policy in this area and this evaluation is currently underway.</p></reply>

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a teacher is &euro;36,318, and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, I welcomed, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. </p>  <p>  For example, a teachers hired in September 2011 would see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the recent outcome of the new entrant pay talks.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  NEPS educational psychologists undertake some 8,000 such referrals for individual casework annually to investigate concerns raised, in the main by schools, in relation to the educational, social or emotional development of those pupils. </p>  <p>  Such interventions are undertaken with parental consent and are documented in a client record maintained within NEPS. This process is predominantly a paper based one and informs the ongoing and future intervention with the child throughout their school career. These files retain all the salient details of the concerns raised in the referral, the details of the nature of the NEPS psychologist&rsquo;s intervention and the report on his/her findings and recommendations which are produced and presented to the parents of the subject and the school authorities.</p>  <p>  Short-hand soft detail of these referrals are maintained by NEPS on the Casetrack database which currently represents the only formal digitisation of the process. Additionally soft copies of assessment reports produced under the SCPA scheme, some 1,500 per annum, are captured by NEPS and retained in soft copy.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that consideration is being given within my Department to the development of a new NEPS management information system which includes a redevelopment of the NEPS Casetrack database. This, in turn, does involve the prospect of maintaining a comprehensive &lsquo;soft record&rsquo; of the referral rather than a hard-copy file. However the digitisation of the archive of NEPS past referral files is not currently being considered.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are legislative matters such as vetting and registration of teachers which the managerial authorities must ensure are complied with. Teachers can only be placed on payroll when certification is received from the managerial authorities that these procedures have been complied with.</p>  <p>  The school year commences on the 1st September and ends on the following 31st August. There are over 9,000 appointment and re-appointment applications to be processed in advance of the start of new school year. A commitment was given to schools and teachers that if fully completed appointment forms were received by my Department on or before 13th July 2018 then the first salary payment would begin on 6th September 2018.   This commitment was met and surpassed in many cases.  My Department continues to receive appointment forms for teachers for this current school year and will continue to process appointments for the payment of salary in a timely manner.</p></reply>

This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the current and future need for primary and post-primary school places across the country, and included provision for a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to be established in September 2020 to serve Citywest/Saggart (Tallaght &amp;amp; Newcastle_Rathcoole school planning areas) as a regional solution. This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p><p>The new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. </p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes will be made available on my Department's website.</p><p>The patronage process commenced in June 2018 for the four new post-primary schools to be established in 2019. The patronage process for the remaining schools, including the new post-primary school referred to by the Deputy, will also be run at a later date, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website () and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie).</p><p>In line with the policy on the use of State assets (Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars 11/15 and 17/16), my Department will be seeking to maximise the use of sites already in my ownership and of available properties in the ownership of other State bodies, where these are considered suitable.  </p><p>In addition as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with Local Authorities in respect of statutory planning processes and under the MoU on school site acquisitions, my Department will be examining all potential suitable site options, including appropriately zoned sites, to serve the relevant areas. </p><p>Taking into account all of the above, decisions will then be made as part of the site acquisition process in relation to appropriate sites for all the schools announced including the new post primary school referred to by the Deputy, and will be confirmed at the earliest possible date. Once a site has been secured, the architectural planning process to provide permanent accommodation for the school can be initiated.</p></reply>

It may have been reasonable when these schools were originally established for a school to assume that its pupil population was predominately Catholic and to arrange religious instruction accordingly. However, this is no longer an appropriate approach. In a changing context the constitutional right not to attend religious instruction must be given effect through changed practices.</p>  <p>  The Department has issued a further circular to schools clarifying the requirements set out previously. The first key clarification is that where a school intends to provide religious instruction/faith formation, parents must give consent before admission to the class. This means that opt out does not arise because the parent has requested a place in the religious instruction class. The other significant clarification is that classes following the NCCA Religious Education syllabuses cannot have any element of religious instruction or worship, which also means that opt out does not arise. </p>  <p>  Religious Education is an examinable subject just like History or Geography for example. It aims to develop the students&rsquo; ability to examine questions of meaning, purpose and relationships, to help students understand, respect and appreciate people&rsquo;s expression of their beliefs, and to facilitate dialogue and reflection on the diversity of beliefs and values that inform responsible decision-making and ways of living. Crucially, it is not delivered from any one religious perspective. Under no circumstances can religious instruction / faith formation be taught during this class in Education and Training Board (ETB) and Post Primary Community schools.</p></reply>

With less than 6 months to go, I was determined to deliver a budget with Brexit at its core, building on the many measures we have already introduced, and responding to the evolving needs of business.</p><p>The agencies under my remit have an extensive range of supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share and continue to pursue new opportunities to grow their market presence within the UK. For 2019, I am allocating an extra &euro;8m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.</p><p>A major initiative that my Department is advancing is the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) supports include:</p><p>- a new Online customs Training Programme to be launched shortly to demystify customs procedure. This will be available to all exporters and importers.</p><p>- Brexit Advisory Clinics: The purpose of these clinics is to encourage companies to examine their potential exposure to Brexit, to complete the Brexit SME Scorecard and use the Be Prepared Grant to plan their strategic response to Brexit.</p><p>- Brexit Scorecard: An interactive online platform to self-assess exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.</p><p>- Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.</p><p>- The Agile Innovation Fund: giving companies rapid fast-track access to innovation funding, and up to 50% in support for product, process or service development projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000.</p><p>- Market Discovery Fund - supports Enterprise Ireland clients research new markets for products and services.</p><p>- &ldquo;Prepare to Export Scorecard&rdquo;: The Scorecard helps Irish companies with global ambition to self-assess how prepared they are to start exporting.</p><p>- Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p><p>- Strategic Consultancy Grant: This helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives.</p><p>- Operational Excellence Offer: Enables Irish companies trading internationally to develop or transform their wider business in order to compete more effectively.</p><p>- Irish Advantage Campaign: The aim of the #Irish Advantage export promotion campaign, is to stimulate awareness of Irish products and services and encourage buyers to source from Ireland. </p><p>In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. </p><p>On 27 September, I led 56 Irish companies on a trade mission to Scotland to explore business opportunities.  In April, I led 45 EI clients on the Northern Powerhouse Trade Mission to Manchester to help them maintain their exports and pursue new opportunities.  Both of these Trade Missions were organised by staff of the Irish embassy in London.</p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices play a pivotal role in supporting micro-enterprises, as they prepare for Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;5m to enhance their programme of supports in 2019, up 22% on 2018.</p><p>I have also allocated an additional &euro;1m in capital funding to InterTrade Ireland, an increase of 17.5%. This will allow them to step up their support for companies in the border region, North and South, who are particularly exposed to Brexit. </p><p>Government&rsquo;s commitment to preparing the business community for Brexit can also be seen in the series of four &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; seminars, which are being held this month around the country.</p><p>The embassy network is under the remit of my colleague Simon Coveney TD, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) approach ensures the development of opportunities for people with mental health difficulties to remain in, or to access, work in mainstream settings and to support employers in addressing attendant recruitment and retention issues. Individuals are also offered supports to access opportunities which are based on their skills and interests. </p>  <p>  It is agreed that 23.5 IPS Employment Specialists will be recruited by employment agencies, with one additional post funded through Service Reform Fund general grant funding for a total of 24.5 positions. All posts will be in place by the end of quarter 4, 2018. There are an additional 5 Early Intervention in Psychosis posts which will also be in place by the end of quarter 4, 2018. The Early Intervention in Psychosis program will share a number of activities with the general IPS rollout including training, fidelity reviews and resources. </p>  <p>  To facilitate the roll-out of the IPS Employment Specialists: </p>  <p>  - An IPS steering group has been established.</p>  <p>  - Meetings have been held with DEASP, Employment Agencies and the National Occupational Therapist Managers group and they have agreed to the implementation and management of IPS at local level. </p>  <p>  - An SLA has been agreed to govern this. To underpin all of this, it is intended to seek the development of a of memorandum of understanding between Department of Health and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to support government policy including a Vision for Change and The Employment Strategy for people with Disability. </p>  <p>  - The signing of Service Level Agreements are underway. As of the 5th of October 2018, there are 12 Service Level Agreements (with 13 associated posts) signed. Negotiations are ongoing in a number of CHO areas but it is expected that each CHO area will have an IPS service in place once complete. </p></reply>

The strategy aims to promote and protect health and wellbeing at a population level by delaying the use of alcohol and other drugs among young people, influencing behaviour and challenging social norms and minimising harm for those who have already started to use alcohol or other drugs.  </p><p>The strategy puts the needs of people and communities at the centre of the response to substance misuse and empowers people to take charge of their own health. It aims to support people and communities in making more positive changes and to influence the wider environment to enable people to make a healthy choice. The strategy complements the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill which outlines measures to reduce alcohol consumption and to reduce the harms associated with alcohol.</p><p>Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem and in initiating appropriate responses, so that there is a coordinated approach involving all sectors to the problem of substance misuse in local communities. In excess of &euro;27.6m has been allocated to Task Forces by the HSE and the Department of Health for community-based drugs initiatives this year. This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided for the last four years.</p><p>The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse in 2014, in view of the central role they play in coordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.  The 2014-2016 Dormant Accounts Action Plan provided a budget of approximately &euro;1m to support the Task Forces in undertaking work at local and regional level to address the alcohol problem. </p><p>The Community Action on Alcohol Project (CAAP) was set up in 2014 to provide Task Forces with training on community mobilisation in order to develop coordinated strategies to change behaviour around alcohol and to raise awareness of alcohol related harm. CAAP training for Task Forces is funded by the HSE and is delivered by the Alcohol Forum. A Steering Group chaired by the Drugs Policy Unit in the Department of Health oversees the work of CAAP. By the end of 2017, 16 of the 24 Task Forces had participated on the Central Training Programme.  </p><p>I recently announced a further &euro;290,000 for Task Forces to support and enhance services addressing drug and alcohol misuse. This money will be allocated in quarter four of 2018. In addition, Task Forces will be consulted by the HSE on the provision of &euro;710,000 for priority projects and services in CHO areas. These resources can be used to support initiatives and treatment services dealing with alcohol misuse.</p></reply>

This process will be guided by National health strategy and policy including the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  A key challenge to delivery of the plan concerns the profiling of the capital funding available, whereby the increased annual allocations are back-loaded towards the latter years of the NDP. There are also pressures arising from factors including inflation, increased construction costs due to changes in building regulations and very high level of claims currently being experienced on projects.  </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for the delivery of health care infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to you in relation to the current position on proposed developments at Tallaght University Hospital. </p></reply>

The two centres will support primary and community care through the provision of general community and paediatric clinics, including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services.  </p>  <p>  Each Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre will provide consultant-led urgent care, with 4-6 hour observation beds, appropriate diagnostics and secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics as well as child sexual abuse unit examination, observation and therapy rooms.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care and 15,000 outpatient attendances every year. </p>  <p>  The centres will provide services and environments of the same quality as those delivered in the new children&rsquo;s hospital, with staff rotating through the outpatient and urgent care centres and the main hospital.  </p>  <p>  There will be an elevated helipad at the new children's hospital, which will have direct and rapid access to the critical care, theatre and emergency departments within the hospital. This enhanced direct and rapid access will improve clinical outcomes for the sickest children and young people.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps is the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service. Air Corps helicopters comprising Augusta Westland AW139 can land on a raised landing site or the roof of a building which is designed and certified for such operations.  The Irish Coast Guard provides reserve support to the National Ambulance Service, when required, through its Sikorsky S92 search and rescue fleet primarily for search and rescue missions. The Sikorsky S92 helicopters are not licensed to land on helipads and, for access to the St. James's Campus, would land in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham from which patients would be transferred in an ambulance by road, which is current practice.</p>  <p>  The majority of patient transfers to the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals are completed by road. In any major emergency rescue in a rural area, a Sikorsky Helicopter will bring the patient to the nearest regional hospital for stabilisation resulting in an appropriately planned transfer to the new children&rsquo;s hospital. </p>  <p>  In relation to your specific query regarding helicopter transfers at Tallaght Hospital, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is a key Government Brexit response for which I had provided &euro;25million in funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy outlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and its potential for future growth. Brexit is obviously a significant challenge given our unique exposure to the UK market. Farmers, the seafood sector and food businesses will need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to continue the growth in Irish agri-food exports, which reached a record &euro;13.6 billion in 2017. The Scheme forms an important part of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response alongside the &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, the provision of additional resources to the agri-food and enterprise State Agencies and an intensification of Minister-led trade missions to access and develop new markets.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300million of loans to the market.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Along with the likes of Milk Flex, this Scheme will form part of a comprehensive investment package for farmers. I am also delighted to be able to include the seafood sector in the Scheme</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing 40% of the funding so an overall agri-food package of &euro;120million will be available. However, unlike previous Schemes, this can be reviewed and adjusted according to demand.</p>  <p>  Further details will be provided in the coming months.  The Scheme is expected to be in place in early 2019 and will run for three years from its launch date.</p></reply>

The Smooth Point project, when complete, will provide an additional 120 metres of sheltered berthage to a depth of -9.0m Chart datum in Killbegs FHC. In addition to facilitating the increased activity, it would also enable relocating larger fishing from the Blackrock Pier to the new berthage area.</p>  <p>  Because some of the material to be dredged was contaminated, the project was divided into two phases. Work on phase 1 of the project which entailed the dredging and removal of the contaminated commenced in 2017 and has been completed in 2018 at a cost of approximately &euro;6.5m. </p>  <p>  &euro;3.5m was allocated for phase 1 in 2018 however as additional work was carried out as part these works an extra &euro;0.7m had to be allocated in 2018 to complete it bringing the expected total spend in 2018 to &euro;4.2m. </p>  <p>  It is now proposed to issue tenders for phase 2 in 2019, with works commencing next year and a completion date in 2020. This phase involves the dredging of the remaining uncontaminated material and construction of the 120 metres of berthing space. The final costs of phase 2 will only be determined following the competitive tendering process, however it is estimated to be in the region of &euro;9m.</p>  <p>  The funding available for the Fishery Harbour Centre capital programme for 2019 has been increased by &euro;6.284m to &euro;27.284m  All developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres are considered under annual capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding. No decisions on the detailed  capital programme for 2019 have been taken at this stage. That said, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to tendering for and commencing Phase 2 of the project at Smooth Point in 2019 and completing it in 2020.</p></reply>

This was an increase of 3.9% compared to 2016, with most of the increase evident in broiler and duck production. To the end of September 2018, Irish poultry production has continued to rise, increasing by 1.8m birds, or 2.6% compared to last year. </p>  <p>  The value of Irish poultry exports in 2017 increased by 3% to an estimated &euro;278 million (CSO trade data), with the United Kingdom accounting for some 80% of this figure in value terms. Other EU markets now account for almost 10% of Irish exports, with France leading the way. Growth has also been evident in trade with Scandinavia and Spain. Exports to third country markets now amount to 10% of export totals, with South Africa showing the biggest growth for Irish exporters. </p>  <p>  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 &ndash; 2020 provides key supports for the development and the competitiveness of the Irish poultry sector. The key areas for support in the RDP for the poultry sector include support for on-farm capital investment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II) and knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions. These programmes will continue to be the main area of support for the poultry sector. </p>  <p>  The investments for the Poultry Sector covered in the PPIS Scheme of TAMS II focus on energy efficient measures such as heat recovery units, solar panels, feed system upgrades, energy efficient upgrades for Poultry houses including insulation, ventilation fans and replacement concrete floors for temperature control. Fixed in water medicine dispensers and water meters are also included in the investment items allowable under the Scheme, as are disease reduction facilities for existing poultry houses.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to farmers who (i) generate a minimum of 20 production units from farming and (ii) who have a Department identifier. The calculation of Production Units for Intensive Enterprises includes, for Turkeys (fattening), a rate of 3.0 units per 1000 bird places. </p></reply>

The impact of this employment creates &euro;171 million in additional spending while the greyhound owners contribute &euro;135 million in spending. The national industry therefore contributes &euro;300 million in additional economic activity. For these reasons I have no plans to cease funding for the sector. </p>  <p>  BnG has assured me that regulation and welfare are a high priority for the Board with &euro;2 million being spent in these areas in 2017. </p>  <p>  In September 2018 BnG announced that a comprehensive, strategic review into the future needs of its 16 licensed stadia to determine the industry footprint of the future is to take place. The review is an integral part of the BnG&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2018-2022, which was published earlier this year. </p>  <p>  BnG&rsquo;s five year strategic plan also puts animal welfare at the centre of the industry. </p>  <p>  BnG has informed me that so far in 2018, 42 welfare inspections and 302 Inspections of greyhound establishments - including trainers&rsquo; kennels and schooling tracks &ndash; have been carried out nationwide. </p>  <p>  The Government  recently approved the Greyhound Industry Bill 2018, which will further improve governance and regulation in the greyhound industry. This legislative framework will allow Bord na gCon to maintain the very positive welfare initiatives that are already in place, as well as implement further progressive measures to allay any public concerns that may exist on welfare within the industry. This Bill, when enacted, will add to existing legislation making the greyhound the most regulated of all canine breeds.</p></reply>

The findings confirmed that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle.  From January 2018 the formal vaccination programme commenced in the areas which formed part of the field trials, i.e. in parts of counties Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and in all of Louth.  Badgers in a vaccination area will be captured/vaccinated/released instead of being captured/culled.  The vaccination program will continue on an annual basis, so each year&rsquo;s births in vaccination areas will be vaccinated as they are captured.  The vaccination area will be expanded incrementally to all parts of the country during the 2018-2022 period and it is anticipated that the rate of badger removal will reduce from the present c.6000 badgers per year to less than 1,000 in c.4-5 years&rsquo; time.</p></reply>

Using a typical system of 1.5kWp, each applicant would get a grant of &euro;1,050 and save about &euro;200 a year in electricity costs. On average this would give a payback of around 9 years.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has structured this grant support based on detailed analysis of costs and willingness to pay research, and the grant level (30-35% overall installation costs) is in line with other grants offered by the SEAI. It is in the interest of  each homeowner to increase self-consumption of the generated solar energy in the home, and by linking the additional grant scheme with battery storage, the scheme is tailored to encourage this.</p>  <p>  The scheme will be subject to a six month review which will examine the uptake and the level of the grant, assess the costs associated with the technology and explore opportunities for broadening the scheme as appropriate. My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro-generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. </p>  <p>  Micro generation, was also appraised as part of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a financial support scheme (payment) for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that in developing and expanding  renewable energy support schemes  that a careful balance must be struck between the subsidy to  renewable generators and the additional costs to pay for these schemes that are transferred to  electricity bill payers. Proposals for all such schemes are and must be subject to careful economic appraisal.</p></reply>

The aim was to identify premises which were not, or would not in the near future, be commercially served with high speed broadband. Based on this work, a High Speed Broadband Map was published in December 2015. The latest version of this map is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The AMBER Area of the Map represents the parts of the country where commercial operators had no plans to deliver high speed broadband services. This is the State intervention area, and delivery of high speed broadband will be achieved through the State Intervention.  The procurement process to appoint a company to build, operate and maintain a network in the intervention area is now in its final stages.</p>  <p>  The BLUE area of the Map represents the parts of the country where commercial operators are delivering or have indicated to my Department that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p>  <p>  My Department also published a process document which set out that the Map may be subject to change if, for example, anticipated commercial deployment failed to materialise or if new plans were presented to the Department and satisfied the criteria as set out in that process document.</p>  <p>  Since December 2015 my Department has continued to monitor the progress of the rollout of high speed broadband for all operators who were included in the BLUE Area on the Map.</p>  <p>  Through direct engagement with operators and further investigation of specific issues, in April 2017 my Department identified 84,500 premises in the Blue Area that were not being served with high speed broadband and these premises were then included in the State intervention area.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively monitor high speed broadband rollout by commercial operators. I have advised previously that people who are experiencing difficulty in receiving a high speed broadband service within BLUE areas should notify my Department in this regard. I continue to invite members of the public to highlight issues regarding broadband connection in BLUE areas by contacting the NBP customer service team at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, or on 01 678 2160.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the defined eligibility criteria. Typical measures available under the scheme include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs.These measures were selected for inclusion in the scheme as they were deemed most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, at least relative cost, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds while at the same time maximising the opportunities for homeowner participation.</p><p>Earlier this year I expanded the measures available under this scheme to include dry lining and external wall insulation. These new measures will increase the number of households that can avail of the scheme. Subject to an SEAI survey, replacement windows may be offered in limited circumstances, most likely where external wall insulation is being carried out and the existing windows are very poor performing and need to be replaced to ensure the insulation performs effectively.</p><p>More information on this scheme is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website or by Freephone 1800 250 204.</p></reply>

The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to transition to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient economy and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors. In parallel, the National Policy Position commits to pursing an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p><p>The enactment, in December 2015, of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, provides the statutory basis for the national transition objective, for the development and submission to Government for approval of a series of National Mitigation Plans and National Adaptation Frameworks, and for independent advisory and Oireachtas accountability arrangements.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s first National Mitigation Plan was published in July 2017 and provides a framework to guide Government investment decisions in measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from four key sectors: Electricity Generation; Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use.</p><p>The Plan set out 106 actions and 60 measures to reduce our emissions. It is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; which is being updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.</p><p>I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, are required to submit sectoral adaptation plans to Government for approval by 30 September 2019. </p><p>Furthermore, recognising the significant obligation which has been placed on the Local Authority sector to develop and implement its own climate action measures, I provided funding to establish and develop four Local Authority Climate Action Regional Offices. These offices will ensure links between sectors and provide expertise and capacity at local and regional level to contribute effectively to the national transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy. </p><p>The publication of the National Development Plan in February of this year represented a step-change in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to climate change, with &euro;21.8 billion in funding directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society. This is in addition to major further investment of &euro;8.6 billion in sustainable transport, including the DART expansion, Metro Link and the Bus Connects programme. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. I am taking a number of immediate steps to achieve maximum emissions reduction to seek to address Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2020 and to prepare us for the more challenging targets that Ireland will face for 2030. </p><p>In relation to biofuels, in May of this year, I signed an order increasing the obligation rate of fuel suppliers from the current level of 8% by volume to a level of 10% by volume which will come into effect from 1 January 2019. I intend to further increase this obligation to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020 and also carry out a public consultation next year in relation to further increases in the post-2020 period.  </p><p>In order to promote further penetration of electric vehicles, I have secured Government support to expand the range of measures in place drive the electrification of transport, adding home charger support, Benefit in kind enhancement, toll reduction and support to the taxi/hackney sector.</p><p>I opened the first phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat for applications on 12 September.  This phase provides a grant of up to 30% of the installation cost of a heat pump system in non-domestic applications.  </p><p>I launched the first call for applications for the Climate Action Fund on 9 July. This is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and it will have an allocation of at least &euro;500 million over the period to 2027.</p><p>I secured Government approval in July for the high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The new Scheme has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The first RESS auction will deliver &lsquo;shovel ready&rsquo; projects, reducing the gap to 2020 and assisting in the early delivery for our trajectory to 2030.</p><p>In relation to the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on fossil fuels, the latest available data, published in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report, Energy in Ireland 2016, indicates that total displacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy resulted in approximately &euro;342 million in fossil fuel imports being avoided in 2016, leading to a saving of 3.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. The overall trend in the contribution of renewable energy to total energy use over the past three years, relative to Ireland's targets for 2020, is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Sector/Sub-sector</th><th>2015 achieved %</th><th>2016 achieved %</th><th>2017 achieved %*</th><th>2020 target %</th></tr><tr><td>RES-E (Electricity)</td><td>25.3</td><td>27.2</td><td>30.1</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>RES-H (Heat)</td><td>6.6</td><td>6.8</td><td>6.8</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>RES-T (Transport)</td><td>5.7</td><td>5.0</td><td>7.1</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>RES Overall</td><td>9.1</td><td>9.5</td><td>10.6</td><td>16</td></tr></table></p><p>*Percentages are provisional data from SEAI.</p></reply>

This involves detailed analysis of electricity demand, electricity supply, electricity storage and interconnection, and locations of electricity demand and supply. A process is currently underway to consider a range of possible ways that energy usage may change in the future, and a series of scenarios are central to an extensive consultation that is being undertaken, covering four scenarios; Steady Evolution, Low Carbon Living, Slow Change, and Consumer Action. Details of this process, termed Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios are available at  </p><p>In relation to renewable energy, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, and we have committed to achieve this through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The most recent annual data from the SEAI indicates that 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.2% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2017. Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, and that the projected 2020 outturn is in a potential range of up to 90% of the target.</font></p><p>Government has adopted a range of further policy measures and schemes to further incentivise the use of renewable energy including the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), and increased biofuels obligation and supports for electric vehicles. In addition, ESB Networks has expanded capacity for delivery of grid connection and My Department has strengthened co-ordination with  the Commission for Regulation of Utilities,  EirGrid and ESB Networks.</p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) work closely with my Department and present a comprehensive overview of energy supply and demand in Ireland to inform Government policy.</p><p>The SEAI has a lead role in developing and maintaining comprehensive national and sectoral statistics for energy production, transformation, and end-use. This data is a vital input in meeting international reporting obligations, for advising policymakers, and informing investment decisions. </p><p>The SEAI have a specialist statistics team, the Energy Policy Statistical Support Unit (EPSSU), whose core functions include the collection, processing, and publishing of energy statistics to support policy analysis and development in line with national needs and international obligations; conducting statistical and economic analysis of energy services sectors and sustainable energy options; and contributing to the development and promulgation of appropriate sustainability indicators.</p><p>As part of this work the SEAI publishes an annual &ldquo;<i>Energy in Ireland</i>&rdquo; Report which presents national energy statistics on energy production and consumption over a set period.

The 2018 Report, covering 1990-2017, is expected to be published in December this year. </p><p>The Report shows that Ireland has a high import dependence on oil and gas and is essentially a price taker on these commodities. However in 2016 Ireland&rsquo;s energy import bill fell by &euro;1.2 billion because of a reduction in fossil fuel imports. While most of this reduction in fossil fuel imports was due to a reduction in natural gas imports, thanks to the Corrib gas field reaching full production, the contribution of renewables avoided 3.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions and saved &euro;342 million in fossil fuel imports.</p></reply>

This week&rsquo;s publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&rsquo;s Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5&deg;C confirms that impacts due to past and current emissions are inevitable and we must prepare for them. The report states that we are already seeing the consequences of 1&deg;C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes.</p>  <p>  The impacts for Ireland are in line what we are seeing globally. In 2017 the EPA published its second &ldquo;State of Knowledge&rdquo; report on climate change impacts for Ireland. While uncertainties remain on the exact scale of the impacts, it is becoming apparent that trends in the temperature and precipitation records as well as those relating to sea level and ecosystems are a cause for concern and that these trends are set to continue. </p>  <p>  In January of this year I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework (NAF) which represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. The Framework sets out the context to ensure local authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making. </p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments with responsibility for twelve priority sectors are required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The deadline for the submission of sectoral adaptation plans to Government for approval is 30 September 2019. </p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right and my Department has made a funding commitment of &euro;10 million over five years to establish four local authority Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs). These offices will underpin a risk-based approach to climate action at the local and regional level and will provide a coordinated response to climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation. Local authorities are also required to have local authority adaptation strategies in place by 30 September next year. To assist these key sectors with their respective planning processes I published &ldquo;Sectoral Planning Guidelines for Climate Change Adaptation&rdquo; in May of this year and later this year I intend to publish revised climate adaptation planning guidance for local authorities.</p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is an iterative process, with the National Adaptation Framework to be reviewed at least once every five years in line with the 2015 Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Departments, Agencies and local authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions as appropriate as climate projections are updated.</p></reply>

The NBP is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State intervention.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, the NBP has driven commercial investment in the upgrade and expansion of networks to the tune of some &euro;2.75 billion. When this Government came into office in 2016 just over 5 out of 10 premises in Ireland had access to a high speed broadband service. Today over 7 out of 10 premises can access this service. </p><p>In Kildare 84% of premises now have access to a high speed broadband service in comparison with 75% in 2016. This number will rise in the coming months as an ongoing commercial deployment by eir continues.</p><p>For those premises that will not be served commercially, the State is in the process of engaging a company to build a high speed broadband network. The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage.</p><p>Evaluation of the final tender submission is ongoing and will be allowed the time required.  On conclusion of the evaluation, my Department will make a recommendation to me on whether to appoint the bidder as preferred bidder and I will bring the matter to Government for decision.</p><p>The Intervention Strategy for the NBP sets out minimum required speeds in line with the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020.  I understand from my Department that the NBP State intervention network is likely to be a predominantly fibre network, meaning most premises can expect a basic introductory offering of up to 150 megabits per second download, with higher speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second download also available.</p><p>The State intervention network, when complete, will push Ireland to the forefront of connectivity, both on an EU and an international level.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p>  <p>  With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations. Other factors would include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  With respect to identifying the areas across the country that do not have adequate coverage, both my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various other initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - Both Departments have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State  and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

The strategy is clear that non-renewable energy sources will make a significant &ndash; though progressively smaller &ndash; contribution to our energy mix over the course of the energy transition. The National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.</p><p>During this transition, some fossil fuels such as natural gas will continue to play a role in terms of enhanced security of supply. Natural gas also has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels.  In Ireland gas powered generation provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation.</p></reply>

As part of their work, the SEAI publishes an annual &ldquo;<i>Energy in Ireland</i>&rdquo; Report which presents national energy statistics on energy production and consumption over a set period. The latest available Report is the 2017 Report which covers the period 1990-2016. The 2018 Report, covering 1990-2017, is expected to be published in December this year. </p><p>The Report shows that Ireland has a high import dependence on oil and gas and is essentially a price taker on these commodities. However in 2016 Ireland&rsquo;s energy import bill fell by &euro;1.2 billion because of a reduction in fossil fuel imports. While most of this reduction in fossil fuel imports was due to a reduction in natural gas imports thanks to the Corrib gas field reaching full production the contribution of renewables avoided 3.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and saved &euro;342 million in fossil fuel imports. The use of renewables in electricity generation in 2016 avoided &euro;192 million in fossil fuel imports with the provisional saving for 2017 at &euro;276 million.</p><p>THE SEAI have also modelled the impact that meeting our renewable electricity targets will have on the Irish economy. Their analysis presents the net new direct jobs (from technology installations), indirect jobs (created in supply chains), induced jobs (from increased consumption), and jobs linked to increased investment in capital stock in the year 2020. Their analysis identified that renewable electricity generation (primarily onshore wind) has a positive impact on the Irish economy and net employment by 2020 with a total of 4,400 net jobs created in 2020. These include over 2,000 direct jobs in construction related to onshore wind with over 500 ongoing direct jobs in operations and maintenance. The remaining jobs are in the supply chain and as a result of higher expenditure in the wider economy. The analysis further suggests that GDP could increase by between &euro;305-&euro;585 million as a result of building new wind farms and the expansion of the electricity grid, by 2020.</p></reply>

These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of waste packaging through registered recovery operators across Ireland. Because Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market, this incentivises them to reduce packaging where possible and in so doing to reduce their fees. To assist members to optimise their packaging, Repak employ packaging technologists who work with their member companies.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, I am working closely with the EU Commission and other Member States to develop an EU wide legislative package for dealing with single-use plastic products. While we continue to work on the detail of the measures to be introduced, the following are the core elements:</p>  <p>  - A ban on certain plastic products</p>  <p>  - Targets for reducing the use of certain plastics and</p>  <p>  - Obligations for producers to cover the costs of waste management and clean up.</p>  <p>  I will be encouraging the Commission and other Member States to expedite the introduction of these measures so that we can introduce meaningful measures to tackle these difficult waste streams.</p></reply>

For instance, collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which, <i>inter alia</i>, require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy.</p><p>Waste management planning, including infrastructure provision, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996. The three Waste Management Planning Lead Authorities monitor on an on-going basis the generation and management nationally of municipal solid waste and other waste streams. Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.</p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for waste operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill. The success of the above and many other policy and legislative measures, including the National Waste Prevention Programme and the phasing-out of flat rate fees for household waste collection, which encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery, has meant that more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground.</p><p>Up until November 2017, different household waste collectors accepted different items for recycling, which lead to some confusion on which items go in which bin. Now, however, following co-operation between my Department, the regulatory authorities, the waste industry, Repak and environmental NGOs, we have a single, standard national list of items and materials that can be placed in the recycling bin.  Removing confusion will play an important role in improving the quality of the waste presented for recycling. This will help to ensure that these items are actually recycled, as opposed to being contaminated accidentally by householders and sent to landfill. Supporting householders in terms of recycling is important. Householders are also being supported through a number of awareness and education initiatives such as the <i>Recycling Ambassadors Programme </i>and <i>recyclinglistireland.ie.</i></p><p>Statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling and recovery rates and reducing our reliance on landfill. In this regard, National Waste Statistics are available to download at <i>/</i>, including the State's progress in meeting targets under EU waste legislation including the Waste Framework Directive; the Landfill Directive; and the Producer Responsibility Directives (Packaging, End-of-Life Vehicles, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Batteries and Accumulators). </p><p>Of particular note is the reduction in the disposal (landfill) rate of managed Municipal Solid Waste, which fell from 41% in 2012 to 21% in 2014. Furthermore, 79% of managed municipal waste was recovered in 2014 (compared to 59% in 2012). Recovery includes treatment processes such as recycling or use as a fuel (e.g. incineration which converts waste to energy or co-incineration, including the use of solid recovered fuel as part of the cement manufacturing process).</p></reply>

Alongside this, our considerable planned investment in the bus system through the new BusConnects programme - initially in Dublin and then followed by other cities - will also support the construction of, where possible, segregated cycle lanes along the improved bus corridors;  the aim in Dublin is to deliver around 200 kilometres of quality cycling facilities as part of the bus upgrade.

These measures have included the allocation of additional security and supervisory operatives, particularly at night and in certain areas, as well as more resources for centralised CCTV monitoring stations. The company also stated that it works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on anti-social behaviour in general and receives the full support of the Garda&iacute;. The RSAC, in its response, recommended the establishment of a dedicated unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police our rail network on occasions when the possibility of anti-social behaviour is high. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus were also contacted for their views and both companies responded that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low and noted a declining trend which is very positive.

This measure refines the development introduced in 2016 and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a previous average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years). This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to multiple entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of (between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child) and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children. The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point.  </p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the ECCE programme in 2010. These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the ECCE programme was set in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills. It ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.</p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. An essential component of the ECCE programme rules is an eligibility start date to ensure that the programme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p></reply>

The principle payment provided for such children is domiciliary care allowance (DCA), which can be paid in respect of children who require substantial extra care and attention as a result of a severe disability.  Over 40,000 children are currently in receipt of this allowance, which is paid at a rate of &euro;309.50 per month.  In this regard, over a third of all applications for DCA are in respect of children with a diagnosis on the autism spectrum.  Eligibility for DCA is not based on the child's disability but on the resultant additional care and attention required.</p>  <p>  In addition, an annual carer support grant (CSG) of &euro;1,700 is also automatically paid in respect of each child in receipt of DCA.</p>  <p>  Children for whom DCA is payable now also qualify for a medical card in their own right.</p>  <p>  Carers allowance may also be payable in respect of children in receipt of DCA, subject to the carer fulfilling certain conditions.  Currently some 55% of DCA recipients satisfy the means test for payment of carers allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition to the supports offered by DEASP, supports are also provided by other departments, including the July Education Programme from the Department of Education and Science, which provides additional summertime schooling hours for qualified children.  The Revenue Commissioners allow an incapacitated child tax credit of &euro;3,300 in respect of all qualified children, which can include those with autism.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018. </p><p>The payment rates for this year are &euro;125 for eligible children aged 4 to 11 years and &euro;250 for children aged over 12 years and attending secondary school.  </p><p>Since 2010, in excess of 100,000 customers can be identified every year from the Department's computer system as having an automatic entitlement to the allowance. These customers are notified of their entitlement and there is no requirement for them to make an application. In addition, approximately 45,000 customers may have an entitlement but need to apply to have this entitlement assessed. </p><p>Similar to arrangements in previous years, the majority of this year&rsquo;s BSCFA payments for 104,461 families in respect of approximately 190,308 children were fully automated and parents were not required to make an application to the Department.  The total amount paid to families with an automatic entitlement was &euro;33.45m and these payments were made during the week commencing 9<sup>th</sup>July 2018.</p><p>In order to qualify for an automated payment the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and the Department were satisfied that the household satisfied the means test for the scheme. The scheme commenced from the 1<sup>st</sup>June 2018 with the entitlement created based on the preceding week's entitlement.</p><p>The  back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a mean-tested allowance. Qualifying for the allowance in a previous year does not in any way guarantee the customer will receive it in a current year and many customers, especially those who had a change in their means or circumstance,  needed to make an application for the payment for this year in order to have their entitlement validated.  Customers with children aged 18 years or over  also needed to apply and provide confirmation that the children were in full-time second-level education.  </p><p>Customers who may have received BSCFA in previous years and did not receive written confirmation of entitlement for this year by end June  needed to make an application. The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme was open for new applications until 30 September 2018.  The scheme is now closed.</p><p>To date (6 October 2018) 142,419 families have been awarded the allowance in respect of 263,239 children, 10,598 applications have been refused and 1,752 are awaiting a decision.Expenditure to date on the scheme is &euro;46.7m. </p><p><b></b>All applications received up to 26 September 2018 have been processed.  The delays in processing applications over the summer arose  as a result of a combination of initial technical issues which arose due to the transfer of the scheme to a new IT platform  and a very high volume of new applications received since the beginning of July. The technical issues were identified and resolved. The number of applications received usually peaks in July and August and tends to taper off after that. Some 1,200 - 1,400 applications per day were received during this period this year. </p><p>However, I can assure you that all outstanding claims are being dealt with expeditiously. As the new system for processing applications is now well established I am confident that improvements will be achieved in processing BSCFA applications for 2019.</p></reply>

However, possible issues concerning the application of certain legal fees have been brought to my Department's attention recently and these matters are currently under examination.</p></reply>

Recognising that the introduction of such a regulatory regime will take time, I am also considering what other measures might, in the interim, support the recommendations and objectives set down in both the Working Group's report and the Oireachtas Committee.</p></reply>
