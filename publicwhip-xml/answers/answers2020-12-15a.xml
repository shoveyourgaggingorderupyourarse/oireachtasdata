Under the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. However, if <b>any</b>student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, irrespective of the nature of their employment they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income.  <i></i></p><p>I understand from SUSI that to date in 20/21, 49 applicants who are participating in nursing courses (that is courses mentioning &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; in the course title and excluding veterinary nursing) have declared a change in circumstance that mentioned Covid-19 or corona virus. Please note that this change in circumstance can relate to the student or a party to their application.</p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, www.susi.ie. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.</p><p>All students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund,<b></b>which assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The SAF allocation is &euro;18.2 million for 2020/21, a record increase on previous years. This includes the once off exceptional &euro;8.1 million provided as part of the Covid support package to help deal with the Covid-19 effect on students. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility under the fund to enable them to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p><p>This in addition to other specific Covid supports for students which I have introduced including a Covid student fund whereby qualifying students will receive a payment or credit worth &euro;250, &euro;15m in IT equipment grants and &euro;3m for wellbeing and mental health. </p><p>I should also say that <b>tax relief</b>at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Financial assistance will be provided to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions.</p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure students;</p>  <p>  - Who avail of the SUSI grant, including students abroad, will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p>  <p>  - Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p>  <p>  - In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students at the discretion of institutions.</p>  <p>  The latter two options are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI benefit from the measure. It is also the intention that these address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.</p>  <p>  Irish/EU/EEA students partaking in courses in other countries who are in receipt of SUSI support are eligible for the payment if they are attending approved SUSI courses in approved higher education institutions within the EU.  However other EU fulltime students outside of the SUSI system must be registered in a publicly funded higher education provider in the State to avail of this allocation. </p>  <p>  In terms of other Irish nationals studying abroad, the provision of supports to Irish citizens based on nationality alone with the exclusion of other EU nationals would be contrary to EU law. It is therefore not possible to provide supports based on Irish citizenship alone. Instead the measure applies to all of these qualifying for SUSI grants, wherever they are studying and those of EU nationality at publicly funded higher education institutions in the State. Additionally a key administrative feature of the fund is that it is being implemented with the assistance of publicly funded institutions in the State under the remit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  SUSI and institutions will be communicating directly with students on arrangements in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative.</p>  <p>  This builds on the additional supports announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education. </p></reply>

This offers a very timely opportunity to set out the task of bridgeing the gap between education and the economy and helping future proof our economy and our people to face the challenges posed by COVID-19, Brexit and digitalisation. Our investment and policies must provide opportunities that are available to everyone, including the most vulnerable.</p><p>Our Plan will have four key drivers - </p><p>We will promote Innovation, providing a clear policy framework for innovation and prioritising investment.  </p><p>We will promote Talent and encourage lifelong learning.  </p><p>We will promote International Engagement, positioning Ireland as global leader in higher education and research.

For the first time, policy and investment in research and innovation, in skills, further education and higher education will all be advanced under one roof.I recently launched a public consultation seeking the views of interested parties on the contents of the Statement of Strategy.  I am encouraging anyone with an interest in social inclusion, in education, in science, in innovation to have a say, as we shape the agenda for the next three years.  A focussed engagement with our agencies and stakeholders as part of the preparation of the statement has also commenced.  We propose to consider all the views received in the New Year and will publish the Statement of Strategy in February.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-15a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121500056#WRA01400"><p>Under the Haddington Road Agreement an Expert Group on Fixed-Term and Part-Time Employment in Lecturing in third Level Education in Ireland was established to assist in addressing concerns raised about precarious employment by Union representatives.  In May 2016 the Chairperson of the Expert Group, Mr. Michael Cush S.C., published his report.  The Department issued directions to the sector on the 4th July 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the report in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.   Implementation by Institutions has proceeded.</p>  <p>  The Cush Report is specific to concerns raised about part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing and its recommendations are not applicable to non-lecturing grades. Work is also underway on the part of the Irish Universities Association, in association with the Technological Higher Education Association, on a new Researcher Career Framework which seeks to improve career progression and structured mobility arrangements for researchers. </p>  <p>  In line with the Universities Act, 1997, third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to human resource policies, subject to compliance with Government policy in respect of employment numbers and pay policy.  Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements. In the event that a union has specific concerns regarding work and contract conditions among staff in any third level institution, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.</p>  <p>  In overall terms progress has been made but it is clear that problems remain.  Some of these problems are in part attributable to the nature of funding streams and activities in the third level sector and these issues are not unique to this country.  However, I envisage that there will be an opportunity to review these issues further during the forthcoming sectoral negotiations under the proposed national pay agreement.</p>  <p>  In relation to postgraduate students, the position is that their programmes are comprised of a range of elements designed to further the training and development of students.  In particular PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills.  These activities are regarded as an integral part of their training and typically include teaching.  Development of these skills is important in equipping students for their future careers, including for academic positions.  The teaching and other generic and transferable skills expected of doctoral students are described in the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills statement provided by the Irish Universities Association.</p>  <p>  PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of up to 5 hours per week over the course of their studies, without extra payment.  Such duties are commonly part of their terms and constitute an important part of their skills development programme.  A range of activities can be included under the teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring.   Where postgraduate students are in receipt of a funding award, participation in such activities can be considered a valuable activity within the award holder's career.</p>  <p>  However, while contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research Master&rsquo;s or PhD student, the core component of research programmes across all universities is the advancement of knowledge through original research and this must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.</p>  <p>  I am advised that a wide range of factors influence the nature of any teaching arrangements including diversity of institutions, disciplines, programmes and research activities; the terms of any research funding award or stipend; the make-up of course fees and various other matters. Taking account of this I intend to engage further with the Higher Education Authority, research funders and other stakeholders to seek further advice on the teaching activities of postgraduate students and consider the issue in more detail. </p></reply>

I am in regular contact with my colleague the Minister for Health. Such close and ongoing cooperation does not take the form of my meeting directly with with the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). My Department has at all times been guided to date by the advice provided by NPHET to government in relation to the protection of public health and how that advice applies to the further and higher education sectoral context. </p>  <p>  In September, as Minister, and together with my officials, I met formally with my colleague Minister Donnelly to discuss reopening. A range of contacts have continued in the intervening period.</p>  <p>  There is strong and continued engagement between representatives of the Department of Further and Higher Education and the Department of Health in relation to Covid-19 response planning for the further and higher education sector. As part of that engagement, the Department meets and communicates regularly with Department of Health and Chief Medical Officer representatives. The Department has arrangements in place to  update the Department of Health on the outcomes of its structured meetings with stakeholders and sectoral representatives, and communicates developments in relation to Covid-19 response planning as it has been impacted by the different levels of restrictions which have been put in place. In recent weeks, my Department has kept the Department of Health fully updated in relation to engagement with the further and higher education sector on planning for the next academic term.</p></reply>

The recommendations contained in the report will assist in addressing concerns raised about precarious employment. The Department issued directions to the sector on the 4th July 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the report in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne  Road Agreement and implementation by Institutions has proceeded.</p><p>The Cush Report is specific to concerns raised about part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing and its recommendations are not applicable to non-lecturing grades. It is important to acknowledge that there can be objective conditions for the employment of an individual on a fixed term basis such as for example, for the completion of a specific task or project or for the temporary replacement of an academic seconded to a leadership role for the period. Nevertheless the recommendations of the Cush Report to avoid unnecessary use of extended temporary contracts are clear. In line with the Universities Act, 1997, third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to human resource policies, subject to compliance with Government policy in respect of employment numbers and pay policy.  Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements.  </p><p>In the event that a union has concerns regarding work and contract conditions among staff in any third level institution, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them. </p></reply>

My intent is to bring a renewed focus and level on ambition to how research and human capital can drive sustainable economic development in every part of Ireland and help us to address major societal and global challenges.</p>  <p>  I have been very struck in my international  engagements on research issues how other European countries are investing heavily in their research infrastructure and capabilities.  It is a matter of strategic importance for Ireland, as a globally-oriented, knowledge-based economy that we remain competive as  a centre of research and innovation. </p>  <p>  In this context, a key priority for my Department in 2021 will be to develop a new national research and innovation strategy.  This will set out how we will strengthen our research ecosystem over the coming years, which will be critical to Ireland's ability to develop research excellence and support our enterprise base and attract foreign direct investment.  </p>  <p>  A key priority will be to develop greater cohesion in research policy and funding across the full continuum. This will embrace all disciplines and the interface between disciplines.  A balanced portfolia of research activity will be critical to addressing the challenges we face as a society and as a global community, which will rely on a high  degree of co-operation and inter-connectedness between researchers in different areas.</p>  <p>  Under the strategic framwork provided by my Department, Science Foundation Ireland, which has traditionally focused on the STEM areas, the Irish Research Council which funds researchers at all stages across all disciplines and the Higher Education Authority, which administers the core grant to higher education institutes will be working more closely together.</p>  <p>  In this over-arching context, Science Foundation Ireland's Annual Plan for 2021 will see SFI deliver a range of programmes which will help develop Ireland as a global innovation leader in scientific and engineering research.   The plan encompasses a balanced programme of activities to deliver excellent research through support of blue sky or frontiers research, investigator-led research, enterprise collaborations and international partnerships. Together, these will deliver tangible benefits to Irish society and the economy. </p>  <p>  The 2021 plan will also further develop the talent base in Ireland, ensuring that Ireland remains a globally leading knowledge- based economy. Finally, it will empower and inspire much greater levels of public engagement with STEM and research.  </p>  <p>  SFI has the following key ambitions and priorities for the coming years, aligned with our national priorities: </p>  <p>  - All Island opportunities, such as all-island research centres, involving collaboration with partner agencies operating in Northern Ireland;</p>  <p>  - Opening a dialogue with the citizens of Ireland to inform the shape of future research and innovation in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - Providing future skills for future jobs through further development of the SFI Centres for Research Training in areas of strategic importance;</p>  <p>  - Working in partnership with other Government Departments to optimise a return on investment in RD&amp;I by developing a National Grand Challenges programme;</p>  <p>  - Developing programmes to continue to ensure that there are programmes available to establish early career and advanced investigator research opportunities.</p>  <p>   SFI&rsquo;s programme portfolio will be designed to ensure that there is a balanced approach to research funding.  Funding of discovery/frontiers research is central to the agency&rsquo;s activities.  As demonstration of this, SFI has recently announced funding of 71 research frontiers awards under its SFI Frontiers for the Future Programme.  This programme is currently active and open for applications.  There is also significant frontiers research taking place within existing SFI investments - including the network of 16 SFI Research Centres.  This world leading, fundamental/discovery research is at the core of the research centres &ndash; driving competitiveness and leading to more applied research projects and ultimately, commercialisation.</p></reply>

This increase will address demographic growth pressures and equates to an overall investment of nearly &euro;80 million to address the demographic increases since 2018.

In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to continue to engage with the sector and to keep me updated on relevant  developments in this important area. </p></reply>

For example, colleges under Donegal ETB work closely with the North-Western Regional College in Derry to provide support to local industry and students to respond to the skills needs in that region.  This is a practical response, not just to regional demands, but also to the efficient use of resources within the education sector on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  I will be looking at what more can be done, including in the context of instruments such as the PEACE PLUS programme, to further enhance this cross-border activity in this area.</p></reply>

The Department has not been directly involved in any such discussions.

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p><p>A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p><p>When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, the grant awarding authority (SUSI) is obliged to satisfy itself beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the grant awarding authority.  </p><p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p><p>Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website:  </p><p>If the student in question considers that he has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he may appeal this decision to SUSI within the statutory time limit of 30 days of his decision letter. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted online by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe of 30 days. </p></reply>

It seeks to deliver 47,000 IT Graduates by 2022 and sets out the priority actions which will be undertaken in the four-year period 2019-2022 to meet the demands for high-level ICT skillsets in the Irish economy. It sets out to provide appropriate education and training pathways for people to train, learn and upskill in a variety of high-level ICT skills which are sought after by a diverse range of industries to support and drive economic performance over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The ambitious targets in the plan will increase the total number of graduates with high-level ICT skills by more than 5,000 every year by 2022. The strategic priorities of the plan will be delivered in conjunction with other initiatives including the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 and the STEM Education Policy Statement 2017-2026, that aim to increase participation at school level in ICT and STEM subjects. </p>  <p>  A key measure in the promotion of ICT and computer science courses to school students is the provision of ICT Summer Camps. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) allocated &euro;260,000 in 2019 to support further provision summer camps by higher education institutions. These Summer Camps are aimed at second level students, with a focus on female participation and aim to encourage young participants to consider a career in ICT and especially computing careers. </p>  <p>  In 2019, 18 higher education Institutions held 58 summer and autumn camps with overall participation of 8,652 students attending from all over the country.  Female participation was 45.1%.  It is important to note that within this overall total, TU Dublin Tallaght campus ran 104 one-day student outreach camps and a National Youth Reach Festival with significant number of students attending both events.</p>  <p>  In 2019 DojoM&oacute;r and MegaDojo events also took place nationwide. The total number of students who attended these events was 2,518 and female participation was 40.7%.</p>  <p>  In 2020 due to the COVID-19 impact, a number of camps originally proposed were cancelled and a number of other providers successfully converted face to face camps to online camps in 2020.  The HEA allocated &euro;296,398 in 2020 to support the provision ICT summer camps by 15 higher education institutions. Approximately 5,000 second level students attended these camps (including two major DoJoMor events).  The rate of female participation in the camps was 49%.  </p>  <p>  As a further means of supporting the uptake of Leaving Certificate Computer Science, the Leaving Certificate Computer Science Support Framework Action Plan September 2020 to June 2021 was published by the Department of Education in November 2020. Actions within this framework include:</p>  <p>  - Buddy/Mentor System: the creation of a panel of Further education or third level mentors to provide online or face to face support.</p>  <p>  - Sponsored PME: a process of engagement with Business and Industry, HEIs and Education and Training Boards to explore the possibility of supporting students in Professional Masters of Education in Computer Science for Further Education.</p>  <p>  - Sustained Support, Initial Teacher Education and postgraduate programmes: This will extend this partnership to FE, HEIs, Business and Industry and Educational Centres.</p>  <p>  - Transition Year: Develop partnership with third-party providers and establish links with local FE colleges that do computer science programmes and support computing apprenticeships</p>  <p>  The importance and relevance of STEM education, and further developing interest in computer science, was abundantly clear during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is certain that many more challenges will face us, and if we can equip our young learners with the STEM tools that will enable them to tackle these challenges in a solution-focused manner then our future challenges may well be overcome through the application of innovation and creativity grounded in STEM education.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to encourage links between further and higher education institutions and schools, to increase the interest of young people in Computer Science and give them the skills they need to succeed in the changing labour market.</p></reply>

This includes a wide range of health professionals undertaking placements with the HSE and the wider Health Service.  Bursaries, stipends, payments and other forms of remuneration are entirely a matter for the Health Service rather than course providers or my department.</p><p>However, I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p><p>I will now outline the various supports available through my Department to assist higher education students, including student nurses. This includes a range of additional supports which have been put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's Covid response earlier this year.  </p><p>The principal support provided by the Department in financial terms is the Student Grant Scheme. Under the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, www.susi.ie. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.</p><p>My Department will spend well over &euro;400 million on student supports in 2020 including the SUSI scheme.  </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, I have secured an additional &euro;20 million to provide for additional applicants, &euro;6 million to expand supports to postgraduate students and an additional &euro;1.5 million to support the most disadvantaged students through the 1916 Bursary scheme.  I have also secured a &euro;50 million fund to support full-time students in third level this year.  This is on top of a range of additional supports which have been provided to reflect the particular circumstances of learners affected by the pandemic, including an additional &euro;10m for access supports services, &euro;15m in IT equipment grants and &euro;3m for wellbeing and mental health.</p><p>In 2020, my Department will spend circa &euro;450m on access measures for further and higher education students. This includes circa &euro;400m on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 74,000 further and higher education students.</p><p>To give an overview of some of the main additional measure put in place:  </p><p>- I have doubled the level of funding available in the Student Assistance Fund for this academic year;</p><p>- I have increased the level of funding for the 1916 Bursary Fund (also known as PATH 2) to &euro;5 million per annum, which will provide an additional 200 bursaries, bringing the total number for 2021 to 1,000 bursaries for the most disadvantaged students in the country; </p><p>- I have secured an additional &euro;20 million in funding for SUSI next year to cover increased applications to the scheme;</p><p>- I have allocated &euro;6 million to enhance SUSI support for postgraduates;</p><p>- I put in place a &euro;15 million scheme to support access to laptops and digital devices;</p><p>- I have secured &euro;50 million to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this group; and</p><p>- I have also allocated &euro;3m for wellbeing and mental health. </p><p>All students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the <b>Student Assistance Fund, </b>which assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. Eligible costs include books and other class material that are required to enable students to continue and participate in teaching and learning, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills such as mobile phone data plans, food, essential travel, childcare costs, medical costs and family difficulties. The SAF allocation is &euro;18.2 million for 2020/21, a record increase on previous years. This includes the once off exceptional &euro;8.1 million to help deal with the Covid-19 effect on students in the financial year 2020. In 2019 the allocation for SAF was &euro;10.1m and supported circa 14,000 students. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility Student in the Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, <b>tax relief</b>at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

Technological Universities are central to delivering on this. </p><p>The establishment of the  MTU will stimulate a more balanced growth of population and employment across Ireland. It will make it easier to secure foreign direct investment and provide quality jobs in the region. , MTU will be a driver of regional development, and it will help to make higher education more accessible. </p><p>Arising directly from the 2019 TURN report, which sets out the blueprint for successful TUs and their development in the State, Budget 2020 introduced a new TU Transformation Fund of<b></b>&euro;90 million to 2023.<b></b>This represents a trebling of annual funding and will see will see TU oriented funding increase to over &euro;120 million in total by 2023. </p><p>The fund will assist in key investment areas including digital infrastructure, research capacity building, change management, systems integration, governance and project management structures and information sharing to establish TUs and assist them to deliver key strategic economic and social development objectives and to respond to specific diverse regional and sectoral impacts such as Brexit. </p><p>On 7 October I announced that the Higher Education Authority, which is overseeing and administering the Fund subject to Department policy requirements, was making a total of &euro;34.3 million in funding allocations. The funds will be disbursed in 2 tranches in Quarter 4 this year and Quarter 1 next year. MTU was allocated &euro;8.25 million under this call.</p><p>Further allocations will be made in 2021 and 2022 with an emphasis from next year onwards on assisting inter-TU and consortia collaboration on systemic projects as TUs bed down and start to operate within their new environments and in pursuance of their missions and functions under the legislation. The Fund will also continue to assist established TUs such as MTU in their crucial formative years. </p><p>In tandem, the Department is working with sectoral stakeholders and with other Government Departments to establish the mechanisms through which TUs can become more financially independent as elaborated in the 2019 TURN report. </p><p>This includes the development of a borrowing framework which will enable TUs to access non-Exchequer funding such as the European Investment Bank provides and put them on an equal footing with the traditional universities. </p><p>It will enable TUs to build their research capacity in both applied and theoretical fields and to attract both increased research funding and to retain and attract high calibre research staff. It will involve the reconfiguration of the financing models currently in place in the publicly funded higher education sector. And it will include the development of more apposite academic career structures to enable the TUs to fulfil their individual missions and goals.</p><p>My Department  is encouraging ownership by the sector of the TU development process such as can facilitate this new type of higher education institution to pursue their own individual missions and to assist the delivery of national and regional strategic priorities such as are set out, for example, in Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan, Future Jobs Ireland, Innovation and Horizon 2020. </p></reply>

As we have now moved to Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID, it is hoped that face to face learning will be increased on a phased and incremental basis for some priority groups. While large-scale learning such as lectures will remain online for the rest of the year, it is intended that priority groups identified by institutions such as first-year students, students who don&rsquo;t have suitable studying facilities at home or vulnerable or marginalised learners will be invited to have more on campus activity, in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  It is also hoped that it will be possible to restart social activities such as sports, clubs and societies to allow students to experience these elements of college life again.</p>  <p>  It is important to be realistic and to continue to stick to public health advice.  The scope for onsite activities will continue to be shaped by the prevailing public health circumstances.</p>  <p>  Further and higher education providers are making their own plans, within the agreed framework, on how to move forward for the next semester and have begun communicating these to students, learners and staff.</p>  <p>  Work will also continue on the communication of coherent, clear, positive and hopeful messages to stakeholders, especially to students and learners.  However, there is also a pragmatic recognition of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and a caution against unrealistically raising hopes.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>The application process generally opens in late March/early April. When students apply for grant support, the application is assessed and the student is notified of the decision in principle. This allows the student an opportunity to appeal a decision before a final decision is made. In a small number of cases, some students don&rsquo;t subsequently qualify for grant support.  I can confirm that 605 students were initially awarded grants but have since had the grants withdrawn by SUSI for the 2020/21 academic year.</p><p>The withdrawal of an awarded SUSI grant may be due to a number of reasons, such as:</p><p>-  An applicant registers for a different course to the course that was previously awarded e.g. theinitial decision in principle was in respect of an approved course and the student subsequently attends a course that does not qualify for support;</p><p>-  An applicant was initially assessed as qualifying for a fee grant only for a course within Irelandand is now attending a course overseas or a PLC course within the State where fee grants are not payable;</p><p>-  New information from the applicant or college is received advising that the applicant is not progressing to the year of the course that the grant was awarded to; and</p><p>-  Post Assessment Quality Reviews carried out on applications for the current academic year discover that a student does not qualify for support.</p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant).

In May 2016 the Chairperson of the Expert Group, Mr. Michael Cush S.C., published his report. The Department issued directions to the sector on the 4th July 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the report in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  Implementation by Institutions has proceeded.</p>  <p>  The Cush Report is specific to concerns raised about part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing and its recommendations are not applicable to non-lecturing grades. It is important to acknowledge that there can be objective conditions for the employment of an individual on a fixed term basis such as for example, for the completion of a specific task or project or for the temporary replacement of an academic seconded to a leadership role for the period. Nevertheless the recommendations of the Cush Report to avoid unnecessary use of extended temporary contracts are clear. In line with the Universities Act, 1997, third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to human resource policies, subject to compliance with Government policy in respect of employment numbers and pay policy.  Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements. </p>  <p>  In the event that a union has concerns regarding work and contract conditions among staff in any third level institution, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.</p></reply>

Lifelong Learning figures for 2019 were just under 13%. If progress continues, we can expect to be on target to reach the 15% by 2025.</p>  <p>  Lifelong learning, and continual investment in skills and human capital development, delivered by the Further and Higher Education system, is critical to sustainable employment creation, and to ensuring we deliver this on a balanced regional basis. </p>  <p>  Lifelong learning is also particularly relevant to the Future Jobs Ireland agenda and has been identified as critical to enabling the transition of workers into new roles and sectors as automation and decarbonisation reshape the economy.  Future Job Ireland 2019 set a target to increase the number of people engaged in Lifelong Learning to 18% by 2025. </p>  <p>  I expect that a key deliverable under the forthcoming National Economic Plan, when finalised, will include a commitment to embed a culture of lifelong learning right across the workforce, which will reinvigorate and energise our workstreams already underway in this area.</p>  <p>  Currently, increased funding is being provided for shorter, more focused courses that can be offered in a flexible manner and through blended or online learning to allow people to gain skills without taking a considerable period away from their workplace.  This Modular provision will further enhance the delivery of flexible modules in a considered manner that meets the need of the economy and society and increase Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Lifelong Learning.  </p>  <p>  A range of initiatives that enable flexible learning and encourage Lifelong Learning are currently in place in the further and higher education sector, these include Skills for Work, Skills, Skills to Advance Skills to Compete, ecollege, EXPLORE, Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative. </p>  <p>  In addition, Skillnet Ireland, which is the national agency responsible for the promotion and facilitation of workforce learning in Ireland, currently provides training supports to 70,000 workers per year. It is expected that this will rise to 100,000 by 2025.  </p>  <p>A range of non-formal and informal training programmes, which work to directly enhance lifelong learning, are also delivered through the further and higher education sector. Such courses focus on foundation or transversal skills development and build core capabilities which enable participants to move on to more advanced learning opportunities.</p></reply>

The introduction of consortia-led apprenticeship development has resulted in the delivery of 34 new programmes across all sectors of the economy, with a further 19 in development. Programmes now range in duration from two to four years and lead to qualifications at QQI levels 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications. Consortia, consisting of employers, education and training bodies and other stakeholders are now able to submit proposals for new apprenticeships on an ongoing basis. All apprenticeship programmes are also subject to periodic review to ensure that their curricula are up to date and fit for purpose.  </p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Government has set a target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025.  This compares against 6,177 registrations in 2019 and achieving this target will require significant focus in the Covid and post-Covid environment.  The Government introduced the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme to support employers who continue to recruit apprentices during the main COVID-19 crises period and during the first half of 2021. </p>  <p>  In bringing forward the Action Plan on Apprenticeship to cover the period 2021-25, I will be advancing the development of an apprenticeship system which provides enhanced visibility and coherence for all involved &ndash; employers, apprentices, education and training institutions and the general public. </p>  <p>In delivering this, all aspects of the current system are being considered together with relevant international research to ensure that apprenticeship is best placed to respond to longer term economic needs while being flexible enough to respond to shorter term challenges.  An extensive consultation process has been undertaken with over sixty submissions received from stakeholders and supplemented with feedback from SME employers through the Regional Skills Fora and through feedback from the 3,750 apprentices who answered a survey on their experience of the system.  An information session was held on 23rd   November to update those who made submissions and other stakeholders of the breadth of feedback and the main observations to date.  It is intended that the new Plan will be finalised in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In addition to the innovative work being done on apprenticeship, curricula for traineeships and further education programmes are revised on an ongoing basis to keep pace with new methods and technologies in the workplace, to ensure learners have a broader range of literacy, numeracy, ICT and teamworking skills, and in response to local skills needs.</p></reply>

This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework has been developed as part of the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s commitment to play its part in delivering on the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020.</p>  <p>  The Framework was developed in collaboration with students, mental health and suicide prevention specialists, academics, researchers and institutional staff. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I also secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and re-opening of our higher education institutions. This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework.</p>  <p>  Following on from publication of the Framework, the HEA contacted institutions to progress its implementation and to follow up on the earlier funding allocations. Many institutions are already in process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, we're expecting many more to follow suit over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The HEA has outlined that the funding allocation for counselling services specifically is data driven, taking cognisance of research reports such as the USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the My World 2 report, the AHEAD &ldquo;Learning from Home&rdquo; report, and also reflecting USI&rsquo;s prioritisation of increasing capacity of counselling services and the finally promoting the implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework.</p>  <p>  In that way, the funding is intended to have a direct and immediate impact for students in this academic year, and the HEA will be requesting a further more detailed report at the end of the academic year which should clearly indicate the metrics used by institutions to measure impact and demonstrate outcomes including in respect of the capacity of counselling services offered by third-level institutions.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling in this current year will allow for development of active outreach to students and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.  </p>  <p>  In October, I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students, Text TCD to 50808. Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required.</p></reply>

The diversity and flexibility of higher education institutions has been key in driving responsive and adaptable approaches to the challenges created by the pandemic, ensuring that the sector has remained open and that continuity of high quality provision has been achieved.</p>  <p>  For the remainder of the current academic term, and in line with the available public health advice, on campus activity is prioritised for essential learning and activities including mandatory skills, practical, mandatory training and assessment. Further and higher education institutions should continue to deliver the majority of their classes online. </p>  <p>  Though dialogue is ongoing, there is a strong shared perspective on planning and communicating the arrangements for the remainder of the academic year 2020/21.

This will include developing a better understanding of what works best within the different models, how we can support different providers in working together and learning from each other, across both the further and higher education system, and examining what is scalable from institutional-level approaches.  There are other important policy and access questions, for example is it better from an access perspective for provision to be provided locally in a further education and training setting or in higher education settings where access may be problematic for some students living further away from the institutions? </p>  <p>  In this context, I will be looking over the coming year to see what more can be done in this area and I have asked my officials to bring forward proposals to me in this regard.</p>  <p>  In looking at these issues, it is also important to akcnolwedge that much of the current provision of education and training for people with intellectual disabilities takes place in the FET sector.  </p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those with a disability. FET programmes are available to all learners, including those with a disability, who meet the eligibility criteria and the guidelines provided for each FET programme. Specialist Training Provision (STP) is also available for learners with more complex support needs, and this provision addresses the identified training needs of people with disabilities who are experiencing exclusion and labour market disadvantage in the form of vocational training programmes. </p>  <p>  Community Education assists learners with a disability to participate in FET provision by adapting course content, resources and teaching methodologies to suit their abilities. FET providers are required to offer reasonable accommodation to learners with disabilities, the nature of these accommodations varies depending on the identified needs of individual learners. FET provision is available across the country in every county. Most of these programmes are either free of charge or heavily subsidized.</p>  <p>  Details of FET courses are available at www.fetchcourses.ie, or through the Adult Education Guidance Service in the learner&rsquo;s local ETB. This service is free of charge and open to anyone over the age of 18, and they will be able to advise of all education and training options, as well as additional supports that are available to learners, including for learners with a disability.  </p>  <p>  SOLAS, the national Further Education and Training authority is currently overseeing an independent evaluation of SPT. The purpose of the evaluation is to examine the quality, effectiveness, on-going relevance and overall value of vocational training that is currently delivered by specialist training providers, and to propose any recommendations for future practice. </p></reply>

This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework was developed in collaboration with students, mental health and suicide prevention specialists, academics, researchers and institutional staff. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our higher education institutions (HEIs) and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our HEIs, and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student supports, and will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc. and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. Many institutions are already in process of increasing their counselling service capacity.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling will allow for development of active outreach to students and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.   </p>  <p>  In October, I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students. The 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required. </p></reply>

A highly developed quality assurance programme is implemented within the assessment process and a focussed programme of independent post-assessment reviews are also performed across targeted risk areas.</p>  <p>  The critical objective for SUSI is to identify and rectify errors on a timely basis before a grant is awarded and thus before any overpayment can arise. Issues identified from quality and post-assessment reviews are fed back into the assessment process through feedback and training on a current basis.</p>  <p>  Where overpayments do arise, SUSI has a formal Overpayments Policy and implements a structured process of debt management to seek their recovery. This process includes portfolio analysis/reporting of the overall debt profile and structured interaction with students as debtors. To date, for the 2020/21 academic year, the total overpayments stand at &euro;25,542.76.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.

The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those with a disability. FET programmes are available to all learners, including those with a disability, who meet the eligibility criteria and the guidelines provided for each FET programme. Specialist Training Provision (STP) is also available for learners with more complex support needs, and this provision addresses the identified training needs of people with disabilities who are experiencing exclusion and labour market disadvantage in the form of vocational training programmes. </p>  <p>  SOLAS, the national Further Education and Training authority is currently overseeing an independent evaluation of SPT. The purpose of the evaluation is to examine the quality, effectiveness, on-going relevance and overall value of vocational training that is currently delivered by specialist training providers, and to propose any recommendations for future practice.</p>  <p>  Community Education assists learners with a disability to participate in FET provision by adapting course content, resources and teaching methodologies to suit their abilities. FET providers are required to offer reasonable accommodation to learners with disabilities, the nature of these accommodations varies depending on the identified needs of individual learners. FET provision is available across the country in every county. Most of these programmes are either free of charge or heavily subsidized.</p>  <p>  Details of FET courses are available at www.fetchcourses.ie, or through the Adult Education Guidance Service in the learner&rsquo;s local ETB. This service is free of charge and open to anyone over the age of 18, and they will be able to advise of all education and training options, as well as additional supports that are available to learners, including for learners with a disability. </p>  <p>  In relation to apprentices, information is sought at the point of registration on any additional supports that may be needed due to disability including those with an intellectual disability. Education and training providers offer learning and other supports to apprentices during their training and many employers also provide accommodations in the workplace to apprentices with disabilities. In accordance with the Programme for Government, a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship is in development to cover the period 2021-2025 with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. The plan will also set out how the apprentice population more closely reflect the general population and offer targeted supports for under-represented groups, including those with disabilities. Stakeholder submissions and a review of the current position of the Pathways findings and recommendations will be used to inform the new action plan which is due to be finalised by year end.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of particular initiatives to give people with intellectual disabilities an opportunity to engage with higher education institutions.  These have tended to be smaller in scale than the system-level provision delivered in the further education and training (FET) sector, but I am interested in seeing what we can do to build on these existing initiatives.  This will include developing a better understanding of what works best within the different models, how we can support different providers in working together and learning from each other, across both the further and higher education system, and examining what is scalable from institutional-level approaches.  There are other important policy and access questions, for example is it better from an access perspective for provision to be provided locally in a further education and training setting or in higher education settings where access may be problematic for some students living further away from the institutions? In this context, I will be looking over the coming year to see what more can be done in this area and I have asked my officials to bring forward proposals to me in this regard.</p></reply>

It offered many opportunities for education stakeholders to reflect on enduring and evolving elements of senior cycle education in Ireland. </p><p>The initial phase involved international research into upper secondary education in other jurisdictions. The second phase involved engagement with schools across the country, where students, parents, teachers, school leaders and other stakeholders shared their views on the senior cycle experience and the future of this stage of education. Phase three took the themes that emerged from phase two to a wider public audience. This public consultation phase included regional focus groups, online surveys and bilateral discussions with groups and organisations. </p><p>During the review, NCCA invited the OECD to conduct an assessment of the Senior Cycle Review process. This happened during the second phase of the review (2018-19) when the OECD team visited Ireland and met with various stakeholders, including teachers, principals, and students, to hear their views on the process of review. The findings of the OECD assessment were presented at the NCCA Senior Cycle Consultation Conference in October 2019 and the OECD report, <i>Education in Ireland: an OECD Assessment of Senior Cycle Review,</i><b></b>was presented to NCCA Council in November 2019. </p><p>The policy assessment presented in the OECD report took stock of the NCCA senior cycle review process, provided feedback on progress made and offered recommendations that informed the design of the third phase of the review, a wide public consultation that took place in 2019. On foot of specific OECD recommendations the NCCA held a series of bilateral consultations with representatives of further and higher education and with industry representatives, including IBEC. The NCCA has also established a Standing Groups with both the HEA and SOLAS to ensure continued structured engagement with these key stakeholders. </p><p>I am satisfied that steps have been taken to remedy the lack of engagement highlighted in the OECD report in question, and will ensure that higher education and further providers continue to be consulted as the Leaving Certificate reform process continues.</p></reply>

Financial assistance will be provided to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions.</p><p>The scheme will ensure students;</p><p>- Who avail of the SUSI grant, including students abroad, will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p><p>- Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p><p>- In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students at the discretion of institutions.</p><p>The latter two options are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI benefit from the measure. It is also the intention that these address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus, as in the case of final year student nurses on clinical placement..</p><p>Irish/EU/EEA students partaking in courses in other countries who are in receipt of SUSI support are eligible for the payment if they are attending approved SUSI courses in approved higher education institutions within the EU.  However other EU fulltime students outside of the SUSI system must be registered in a publicly funded higher education provider in the State to avail of this allocation. </p><p>In terms of other Irish nationals studying abroad, the provision of supports to Irish citizens based on nationality alone with the exclusion of other EU nationals would be contrary to EU law. It is therefore not possible to provide supports based on Irish citizenship alone. Instead the measure applies to all of these qualifying for SUSI grants, wherever they are studying and those of EU nationality at publicly funded higher education institutions in the State. Additionally a key administrative feature of the fund is that it is being implemented with the assistance of publicly funded institutions in the State under the remit of my Department.  </p><p>SUSI and institutions will be communicating directly with students on arrangements in the coming weeks.</p><p>Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative.</p><p>This builds on the additional supports announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education.</p></reply>

As announced in July, the Government has provided additional and re-prioritised funding in the amount of &euro;168m to enable providers to facilitate the safe return of students to further and higher education in 2020, in the context of public health advice.

The recommendations contained in the report will assist in addressing concerns raised about precarious employment by Union representatives. The Department issued directions to the sector on the 4th July 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the report in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and our understanding is that the Institutions took steps to do so. </p>  <p>  The Cush Report is specific to concerns raised about part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing and its recommendations are not applicable to non-lecturing grades. It is importantto acknowledge that there can be objective conditions for the employment of an individual on a fixed term basis such as for example, for the completion of a specific task or project or for the temporary replacement of an academic seconded to a leadership role for the period. Nevertheless the recommendations of the Cush Report to avoid unnecessary use of extended temporary contracts areclear. In line with the Universities Act, 1997, third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to human resource policies, subject to compliance with Government policy in respect of employment numbers and pay policy.  Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements.  </p>  <p>  In the event that a union has concerns regarding work and contract conditions among staff in any third level institution, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them. </p></reply>

Apprenticeship is an employer led offering.  As such, and given the employment status of apprentices, apprentices will need to be included within public sector employment ceilings where these exist.  Apprenticeships should therefore be focused on areas of identified skills needs within the sector. </p>  <p>  Craft apprenticeships are well established within the public sector with in the region of 200 craft apprentices in employment across the sector. In addition to craft apprentices, 40 ICT and 10 Accounting Technician apprentices were recruited in 2019 and employed across 10 Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  Feedback from individuals involved in the ICT apprenticeship programme has emphasised the need to have relevant supports and procedures in place for apprentices at the commencement of their programme.  The availability of mentor staff is critical to the success of the programme for individual apprentices, particularly in the challenging post COVID-19 environment.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship for the coming 5 year period is under development.  In addition to the Programme for Government commitment, the role of the public sector in apprenticeship recruitment was raised by a number of stakeholders during the consultation process and proposals in this area are informing the new action plan.   </p></reply>

This group, which included the presidents of TU Dublin and of those Institutes of Technology involved in TU development, the Higher Education Authority, the Technological Higher Education Association, and the Department, produced a seminal report in October 2019. This report sets out in detail the blueprint for successful TU development in this country. It describes the rationale, benefits and key requirements of this new type of higher education institution in Ireland. The report is entitled "Connectedness and Collaboration through Connectivity". </p>  <p>  TUs are closely connected with their regions, stakeholders, students and staff. They are collaborative partners with enterprise, research communities, local and national government, and other education providers at home and abroad. Their connectivity is reflective of the modern, globalised, digitally connected world in which students, staff and stakeholders live, work and study.</p>  <p>  The TURN report makes a series of 12 recommendations for outcomes that will provide a solid foundation for the development and progression of TUs, centring on the thematic areas of investment in integrated multi-campus digital infrastructure, research capacity-building, and realignment of the policy framework and funding for TUs. The focus is now on the implementation of these recommendations, including the development of academic career structures, by the sectoral stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Arising directly from the TURN report, budget 2020 introduced a new TU transformation fund of &euro;90 million going out to 2023. This represents a trebling of annual funding and will see TU-oriented funding increase to over &euro;120 million by 2023. The fund will assist in key investment areas including digital infrastructure, research capacity building, change management, systems integration, governance and project management structures and information sharing to establish TUs and assist them to deliver key strategic social and economic development objectives and to respond to specific diverse regional and sectoral impacts such as Brexit. On 7 October I announced that the Higher Education Authority, which is overseeing and administering the Fund subject to Department policy requirements, was making a total of &euro;34.3 million in funding allocations.  The funds will be disbursed in 2 tranches in Quarter 4 this year and Quarter 1 next year. MTU was allocated &euro;8.25 million under this call.</p>  <p>  Although they will pursue their own individual missions, the common threads that will run through all TUs are identified in the TURN 2019 report &ndash;&ndash; higher education access, provision of high quality research-led teaching and learning excellence across all levels of the National Framework of Qualifications, skills and employment retention and creation, collaboration with other education institutions in further and higher education, regionally, nationally and internationally  and the creation of a welcoming and supportive personal developmental environment which will allow all learners and students to fulfil their individual and societal potential.  </p>  <p>  The Department continues to work with TUs, TU development consortia and with relevant Government Departments and agencies on the implementation of relevant TURN report recommendations. </p>  <p>  The Department is encouraging ownership by the sector of the TU development process such as can facilitate this new type of higher education institution to assist the delivery of relevant national and regional strategic priorities are set out, for example, in Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan, Future Jobs Ireland, Innovation and Horizon 2020. </p>  <p>  As such, it remains a matter for MTU under its first incoming president and governing body to decide on the most appropriate way in its own particular circumstances in which it can assist in the delivery of skills and employment retention and creation regionally in consultation and collaboration with its internal and external stakeholders. </p>  <p>  However, I do know from  meeting with Regional Skills Forums throughout the country that there is a real excitement among the business community, educators and citizens in the regions about the difference TUs are making and will make to a number of key regional priorities including higher education access, research capacity building, the skills agenda and socio-economic progression. </p>  <p>  Business owners, employers, students, education providers will be able to sit down together with the TUs and plan the skills needed for the regions as appropriate. TUs will also transform the decisions that younger people can make. If they can stay in their own community and access a university education, they are more likely to maintain their roots in that community and to contribute to the broader societal good. </p></reply>

I am delighted that Science Foundation Ireland, which has traditionally focused on the STEM areas, the Irish Research Council, which funds researchers at all stages across all disciplines and the Higher Education Authority, which administers the core grant to higher education institutes will be working more closely together under the auspices of my new department.</p>  <p>  It is important that research is carried out using the most relevant methodologies to ensure the research question or problem is addressed. Many international organisations and national governments have begun to embrace Mission-Oriented Investment programmes or Grand Challenges to channel multi-annual funding and a multi-disciplinary approach to enable research and innovation address significant societal challenges. We see examples of the missions that are proposed under the next EU Framework Programme, Horizon Europe. </p>  <p>  As signalled in the Programme for Government, adopting a mission or grand challenge approach to solving societal challenges here in Ireland will not only ensure that we optimise our research and innovation capabilities to meet current and future challenges but through this approach we will further develop the skills of our talented researchers and academics to understand how the discoveries of the future can benefit us all.</p></reply>

This is the highest rate of maintenance grant support available. The income threshold for the Special Rate of Grant is linked to movements in the Old Age Pension (OAP) and the increases in the OAP payments in recent years are reflected in the changes to the income threshold which has increased from &euro;22,703 in 2010 to its current figure of &euro;24,500.</p>  <p>  According to the CSO, the increase in the average weekly income during the period Q3 2010 to Q3 2020 was 16%. Therefore, based on CSO data, annual average income for 2010 was &euro;36,371.92 compared to &euro;42,201.12 in 2020.</p>  <p>  The student grant scheme has gradations to the income thresholds to further extend the coverage of eligibility for different grant values at the rates of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% of maintenance grant. The Student Grant Scheme also provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  Before adjustments for the number of dependent children, additional persons in college and income disregards, which can bring the qualifying income threshold up, the highest standard income threshold for a fee only grant is &euro;54,240.</p>  <p>  I do recognise that there is an immediate challenge which we must meet in responding to the changed economic circumstances brought about by Covid-19 and the likely effects of Brexit. I also want to look strategically at the wide range of issues related to the SUSI scheme and that is why I recently announced plans to review the scheme. It is intended that the review will commence shortly and will be completed by summer 2021. The review, which will include stakeholder consultation, will inform future decisions regarding the future direction of the SUSI scheme.</p></reply>

To support the Department of Health and Health Service Executive to deliver a COVID-19 immunisation programme, that meets best practice and provides good governance, as a critical public health intervention in the prevention and control of COVID-19.</p><p>2. Working with the Department of Health and Health Service Executive, to develop a national COVID-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan for the safe, effective and efficient procurement, distribution, delivery and recording of COVID-19 vaccines when approved vaccines are ready to be distributed.</p><p>3. To provide a focal point for engagements with sectoral and specialist expertise as may be needed to support the development, implementation and agile iteration of the strategy/plan.</p><p>4. To monitor progress and report to Government, as may be required, on the development and implementation of the strategy/plan.</p><p>The Task Force includes senior representatives from across the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach, as well as expertise in the areas of public health, supply chain logistics, cold chain logistics, and programme management. </p><p>When the Task Force was established in mid-November, there was already significant ongoing work on planning for this vaccination programme and governance in place across both the HSE and the Department of Health. Under the coordination of the Task Force, this has all been brought together under a single integrated work programme utilising the wide range of relevant and high-level expertise and experience of Task Force members.</p><p>The HSE has ultimate responsibility for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, through its National Immunisation Office (NIO), which designs and implements all vaccination programmes in Ireland.</p><p>The Taskforce has prepared drafts of Ireland&rsquo;s National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme Strategy and accompanying Implementation Plan. The Minister for Health brought these to Government this morning<b>and both documents were approved by Government.</b></p><p>The Strategy document is designed to be a comprehensive framework establishing clear objectives and principles. It identifies the pathways for managing a programme of this scale. </p><p>The Implementation Plan is designed to be a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; in that it needs to be agile, flexible and capable of evolving over time (for example to accommodate vaccines with differing characteristics or to respond to lessons learned in our local experience or internationally). </p><p>It describes the logistical, operational and human resource requirements for Ireland to begin vaccinations in line with Government guidance in early 2021 assuming the approval of one or more safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for use.</p><p>The Strategy and Implementation Plans<b>are being published today on gov.ie</b></p><p>The Task Force is committed to the ongoing oversight and monitoring of the vaccination programme and will update and revise the implementation plan as required to serve the overall goals of the programme.</p></reply>

For example, IDA Ireland has worked closely with Laois Offaly ETB, Grow Remote and Solas to launch two courses aimed at improving the skillsets of remote workers across Ireland. These courses have proven to be very popular since their launch earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Regional Cleanroom Project is a new training centre in Tullamore established in October 2019 by Laois and Offaly ETB (LOETB). Catering to biopharma and med-tech sectors, the fully functional clean room areas (class 8) will be used to provide up-skilling / training in a realistic GMP simulated manufacturing environment. The facility can build bespoke training solutions at Level 5 and 6, encouraging new entrants into the sector.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has welcomed the recent application by Athlone IT and Limerick IT to form a Technological University. The new technological university aims to connect knowledge creation with industry partnerships to grow and support collaboration. AIT has also benefited from funding for a new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) building, announced as part of the Department of Education and Skills &euro;200 million investment in Institutes of Technology. This building will create capacity for an additional 1,000 STEM students, enabling AIT to provide for increased student demand on programmes in pharma, biopharma, microbiology, sport and health science and design, innovation and technology.</p>  <p>  In addition, the IDA Midlands Regional Manager has sat on the Midlands Region Transition Team (MRTT) since its inception following the announcement of Bord na Mona&rsquo;s strategy to transition from &lsquo;Brown to &lsquo;Green&rsquo;. Under a new framework adopted by the Just Transition Commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, four new Working Groups have now been established under the MRTT. IDA Ireland is represented on Working Group 2 &ndash; Employment Generation by the Regional Managers of both the Midlands and West Regions. One of the objectives under this WG is to progress Future Employment &amp;amp; Skills Development. </p>  <p>  The IDA has collaborated on and supported several surveys for the Midlands Region, such as the Laois Town Profile, the Midlands Skills Survey and the Laois Commuter Survey.</p>  <p>  The IDA Midlands Regional Manager sits on the Steering Committee of the Midlands REP Advanced Manufacturing Plan team, together with key stakeholders from industry across the Region. A draft plan is to be issued shortly that will set out a shared vision for developing advanced manufacturing across the Region over the coming years. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland also supports the Midlands Lean Network. This collaborative network facilitates peer companies to meet and discuss various challenges and opportunities that present themselves, including the re-training and up-skilling of staff to work with the latest technologies.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Winning Foreign Direct Investment 2015 - 2019, set out challenging targets in respect of the FDI sector for the period.  These targets included amongst others, the creation of 80,000 direct jobs in 900 investment projects over the period, bringing total FDI Employment to 209,000 by the end of the period.  Under the program, IDA targeted a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin. All targets from that strategy were achieved, with 1,209 investments creating 112,373 jobs achieved over the 5 years. </p><p>A new IDA strategy covering the period 2021 to 2024 will be launched shortly. Regional development will remain at the core of IDA&rsquo;s strategy for the next 4 years. Maintaining competitiveness and improving the carrying capacity of the economy will be critical to delivering FDI over the next period  <i>. </i></p><p>The Midlands Region (Westmeath, Longford, Laois, and Offaly) has 43 multinational companies who collectively employ 6,209 people<i>.</i>The Region has been successful over several years in mobilising inward FDI, with employment levels in IDA client companies increasing every year since 2012. The Midlands offers an attractive cluster of LifeSciences and Global Business Services companies, excellent connectivity to major cities and Dublin airport and world class collaboration between academia and industry. The 2019 results show employment in the region at 245,096, an all-time high. </p><p>IDA clients account for 10.5% of national employment and growth in 2019 was 6% compared to 2.4% nationally. IDA client companies created 21,844 jobs across a range of sectors in 2019.  Expenditure by IDA clients totalled &euro;21.5 bn, an increase of 11%, and is made up of payroll (+12%) &euro;13.3bn; materials (+9%) &euro;2.6bn and services (+12%) &euro;5.6bn. <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>No. of companies</th>       <th>Total Emp</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>22</td>       <td>3,686</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>11</td>       <td>1,192</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>121</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>37</td>       <td>4,999</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><i>(Source: DBEI Employment Survey 2019)</i></p><p>While FDI cannot form the sole economic development strategy for a region, it can play a huge role in increasing economic activity and reducing unemployment. However, winning such investments is a challenge and will require a concerted and continuous effort by all national and regional stakeholders. This will require greater co-operation, collaboration and integration to develop and present the strongest possible proposition to existing and future potential investors.</p><p>In response to COVID, IDA migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. IDA Ireland has developed a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The Agency has developed this further and has put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.  The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and also in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors. <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Site visits end Q3 2020</th>       <th>E visits end Q3 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Site Visits 2019</th>       <th>Grant Payments 2019 &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>22</td>       <td>4,557,617</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1,195,208</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County </td>       <td>Site Visits 2018</td>       <td>Grant Payments 2018 &euro;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>22</td>       <td>3,146,661</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>5</td>       <td>201,335</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>24,850</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County </td>       <td>Site Visits 2017</td>       <td>Grant Payments 2017 &euro;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>42</td>       <td>2,078,588</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>5</td>       <td>960,089</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>24,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County </td>       <td>Site Visits 2016</td>       <td>Grant Payments 2016 &euro;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>36</td>       <td>1,768,687</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>4</td>       <td>355,540</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County </td>       <td>Site Visits 2015</td>       <td>Grant Payments 2015 &euro;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>28</td>       <td>2,513,508</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>8</td>       <td>120,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>75,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>County Laois Employment developments in IDA companies </b>(Update from Employment Survey 2019) <table>    <tr>       <th>Employment Data</th>       <th>2010</th>       <th>2011</th>       <th>2012</th>       <th>2013</th>       <th>2014</th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No of Companies </td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Jobs</td>       <td>133</td>       <td>108</td>       <td>84</td>       <td>106</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>105</td>       <td>115</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>111</td>       <td>121</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gross Gain</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gross Losses</td>       <td>-1</td>       <td>-27</td>       <td>-24</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>-28</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>-13</td>       <td>-6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Net Change </td>       <td>13</td>       <td>-25</td>       <td>-24</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>-19</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>-9</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Announcements made over the last two years include Greenfield Global Inc., Canada&rsquo;s largest producer of alcohol and fuel ethanol, and one of the largest alcohols and solvents companies in North America, officially opened their new 3,800 sq. metre EU manufacturing headquarters located on IDA&rsquo;s Business and Technology Park in Portlaoise in July this year.

Throughout the pandemic, the network of Local Enterprise Offices have continued to act as a point of contact for businesses around the country, and they can offer advice and support to small businesses, including start-ups, about how best to proceed and what supports are available to them. </p>  <p>  The latest SME Credit Demand Survey, published 20 November, reported that 85% of credit applications were approved during March and October 2020. This rate is consistent with previous survey results. However, the survey reported the demand for credit by SMEs remained subdued at 18%.</p>  <p>  However, for micro-businesses that have had difficulty accessing finance through banks or other commercial lending providers, there are also Start-Up Loans available through MicroFinance Ireland [MFI] to microenterprises. These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 for terms of up to three years, with an interest-only initial payment period of three months. </p>  <p>  Through Enterprise Ireland [EI], Government has also had long-term involvement in the seed and venture market, bringing investment to Irish businesses and helping them start and scale. To ensure continued support for start-up companies during the COVID-19 recovery, the Government is also investing in an additional fund to support highly innovative firms.</p>  <p>  Since 1994, EI has managed five Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Schemes to ensure that there is an available and effective overall funding ecosystem and to address market failures in this area. EI has made commitments to venture funds of &euro;549m under the five Schemes. In 2018, the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment, announced the most recent Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme with a further allocation of &euro;175m to be committed over the lifetime of the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme (2019-24), the first commitments under this scheme were made in 2019 and will continue to be made over the coming 12-24 months to fully deploy all the available capital. A further &euro;10 million was announced in the 2020 July Stimulus and is currently being deployed, with an additional &euro;11 million committed in Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  EI continues to support and fund the Halo Business Angels Programme (HBAN).  The Programme is a joint initiative with Intertrade Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland aimed at building a strong funding ecosystem at each stage of the funding journey for start-ups. The availability of Angel funding at the early stages of a company&rsquo;s development provides both essential capital and hugely valuable industry experience to support companies through this early phase of growth. In 2019, HBAN announced that over &euro;100M of angel investment has been mobilised across the island of Ireland since the programme commenced in 2007.</p>  <p>  EI also operates the Competitive Start Fund, the purpose of which is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capacity to succeed in global markets. The fund is designed to enable those companies to reach key technical and commercial milestones. In 2020 Enterprise Ireland approved 45 applicants for funding under three Competitive Start Fund calls.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government also announced &euro;30 million in funding, through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund [ISIF], to develop an early stage seed and growth capital investment scheme, targeted at domestic, high innovation enterprises. The Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment is working with the Department of Finance, representatives from EI, ISIF, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund to develop a proposal to leverage further European capital and establish an equity fund using this &euro;30 million.</p></reply>

In September 2019 ESB Networks commenced the replacement of over 2 million electricity meters and by end November 2020 over 214,000 electricity meters have been installed.Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have availed of SEAI grants or support to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets for the number and depth of residential retrofits to be completed by 2030. The overarching target is to reduce residential greenhouse gas emissions by 2-3 million tonnes. This will be achieved by retrofitting 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, the Government announced that &euro;221.5 million in capital funding will be provided for residential and community retrofit programmes next year. </p><p>Similarly, this<font color="#212121">Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years.</font></p><p><font color="#212121">There are currently circa 650 standard public charge points and over 100 fast charge stations in Ireland (the majority of which are operated by the ESB). In addition, my Department has committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network across Ireland and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: </font></p><p><font color="#212121">- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</font></p><p><font color="#212121">- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</font></p><p><font color="#212121">- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points.</font></p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, SEAI on behalf of my Department, administers an EV home charger grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. Since the home charger grant scheme was introduced in January 2018, a total of 6,155 grants were paid out to the end of October 2020. </p></reply>

This is a complex problem seen in many countries.  Last year, an Expert Advisory Group was formed to explore potential policy approaches to address the split-incentive and increase the number of rented properties undergoing energy upgrades.  The Group is comprised of representatives from my Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the SEAI and the Residential Tenancies Board.    Based on an analysis of policy approaches in other jurisdictions and input from stakeholders, the Group selected a number of potential policy measures for a public consultation, including the introduction of a minimum BER for private rental properties.  Over 90 submissions were received in response to the consultation. </p>  <p>  The results of the public consultation have been analysed by my Department and will inform the Expert Advisory Group's policy recommendations which will be submitted to me next year. Submissions stressed the importance of striking the right balance between ensuring a sufficient supply of rented accommodation and taking action to improve energy efficiency of the private rented stock.</p>  <p>  Currently, landlords can apply for grant support to upgrade their rental properties under a number of SEAI grant schemes including the Better Energy Homes scheme. The SEAI also recently launched the One-Stop-Shop Development Call as part of the National Retrofit Scheme. The findings of the consultation helped to inform the decision to include encouraging the retrofitting of rental properties as an objective of the scheme.  The consultation also informed the decision to improve the level of support available for the retrofitting of rental properties under the SEAI Community Energy Grant scheme.  Grant support of 35% is now available versus 30% previously.</p></reply>

A public consultation on the project took place between September 14 and December 11    this year with 7 options consulted on -4 overhead line corridors and 3 underground cable routes. The outcome of the consultation, which included webinars and direct mail advertising, will help to identify which technology and corridor options are the best performing.

The SDZ initiative demonstrates Government commitment to develop coherent regional plans to drive the regional economy.</p></reply>

The Centre is composed of highly skilled, specialist technical staff having skillsets in computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cyber security compliance. The NCSC also acts as a conduit for information to its constituent base, including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, Government Departments and Agencies, via the Alert &amp;amp; Advisory System. The NCSC provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and is involved in coordinating the response to significant incidents, including those under the EU Network and Information Security Directive. </p>  <p>  European security is heavily dependent on cyber resilience, and each EU Member State is responsible for the cyber security in that State. With respect to Digital  Service Providers, the EU Network and Information Security Directive was transposed into Irish law in September 2018, and requires Ireland  to apply and enforce a regulatory regime for Digital Service Providers, including in the area of cloud computing providers.

In this context the Department held a public consultation process between November 2019 and February 2020, and included a stakeholder event in the course of that consultation.  Over 250 submissions were received as part of this public consultation process and I published a report of the public consultation. </p>  <p>  I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme.  The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework (known as Smarter Travel), submissions received during my Department's consultation process and the views and recommendations of other relevant stakeholders.  It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including active travel, and will replace the previous Smarter Travel policy, dating from 2009.  </p>  <p>  Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. Among the measures we will prioritise is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Local Link services.</p>  <p>  The NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the GDA, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.</p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is starting on a two-phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland';  this will begin with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and then will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q2 2021 on the proposals.</p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's specific question in relation to improvements to rural transport in County Kildare to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you have not received a reply within ten days.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-15a.359.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121500062#WRG00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 164 and 165 together.</p>  <p>  An efficient and low emitting public transport system is a key priority of my Department, and the transition of the Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) sector (which includes taxis, hackneys and limousines) to low emission vehicles has been a particular focus in recent years. This reflects the fact that, despite representing less than 1% of the registered vehicle fleet, SPSVs can have a disproportionately high impact on transport emission levels, particularly in urban areas. This is due to the high mileage travelled by these vehicles, the stop/start and idling nature of their work, as well as the predominance of fossil fuels within the sector. </p>  <p>  Using 2015 data it is estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from the SPSV sector amounted to 112 kilotonnes or 28% of total public passenger (bus, hackney &amp;amp; taxi) emissions for that year. This calculation assumes an average annual vehicle kilometres for SPSVs of 38,000km (in 2019 the average annual kms were estimated at just over 39,000km). </p>  <p>  The transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero-emission and zero-emission capable vehicles therefore has an important role to play in effecting a substantial reduction in transport carbon dioxide and of air pollutant emissions, particularly in Irish towns and cities. Additionally, increasing the uptake of EVs in the SPSV sector can have a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low/zero emission mobility options. </p>  <p>  Following recommendations by the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce in 2018, my Department established an Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the National Transport Authority (NTA). The Grant offers up to &euro;10,000 towards the purchase of an eSPSV, with a further &euro;2,500 available to convert the vehicle to a wheelchair accessible model. It also provides support of up to &euro;5,000 for the purchase of plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) SPSVs. The eSPSV Grant Scheme can also be used in conjunction with other incentives for EV drivers, including VRT relief, lower rates of motor tax, and a reduction in road toll charges.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the eSPSV Grant in 2018, 94 SPSV drivers around the country have availed of the grant and changed to an electric vehicle, including 11 who drive PHEV eSPSVs.  This is in addition to the 2,696 conventional hybrid SPSVs currently in operation on Ireland&rsquo;s roads. In 2019, just over 11.5% of the SPSV fleet were hybrid or zero and low emission vehicles, compared to just under 2% of the fleet in 2015. The 94 electric cars in operation in 2019 also represents a significant increase, albeit from a low base, from the 4 electric SPSVs that were in service in 2015.</p>  <p>  In 2019, 115 applications were made for electric vehicle grants under the eSPSV Scheme, with 35 individual grants awarded. The total value of grants awarded under the Scheme in that year was &euro;187,000. In the same year, 31 applications for eSPSV grants for PHEVs were made, with 7 individual grants awarded, and grant funds to a total value of &euro;13,000 awarded to support PHEV SPSVs. </p>  <p>  Despite the significant negative impact that the Covid-19 crisis has had on the eSPSV sector, since 01 January 2020, 80 electric vehicle grant applications were made to the Scheme, with 20 individual grants awarded. The total value of grants awarded to date this year is &euro;159,000. Twenty-five (25) applications for PHEV eSPSV grants were made since January, with 4 individual grants awarded, and grant funding to a total value of &euro;19,000 awarded to support  PHEV SPSVs.</p></reply>

In this context, An Taoiseach launched the Shared Island Fund with a planned &euro;500 million to be made available over the next five years to 2025.</p><p>Funding will be allocated to Government Departments and Agencies to fund a variety of cross-border projects, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government which includes working with the Northern Ireland Executive to deliver key cross-border infrastructure initiatives. </p><p>A5 Upgrade Scheme</p><p>Under the  &ldquo;Fresh Start Agreement&rdquo; the Irish Government is committed to providing funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) for the construction of Phase 1a of the proposed upgrade of the A5 road.  The Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) is also now included in the &quot;New Decade, New Approach&quot; document. </p><p>As is the case for all such capital projects, the A5 upgrade scheme is subject to the planning assessment and approval process in Northern Ireland.  Following the conclusion in 2018 of a legal challenge which resulted in the quashing of the previous approval of the A5 upgrade scheme, the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure initiated a review of the scheme, including the holding of a new Public Inquiry,  with a view to facilitating a new decision on the scheme.  This process has not yet reached a conclusion.</p><p>Narrow Water Bridge</p><p>Following on from the Fresh Start Agreement, the &quot;New Decade, New Approach&quot; document indicates that the Government is ready to jointly progress consideration of options for the development of the Narrow Water bridge project at the North South Ministerial Council.  </p><p>Options for the development of the Narrow Water Bridge project are under examination at present taking into account other proposed projects in the area including the Newry Southern Relief Road.

The service resumed, on a gradual basis, in mid-July.</p>  <p>  Since resuming operations, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog. Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity has had to be considerably reduced. This means that customers experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Level 5 restrictions which took effect for six weeks from 22 October 2020 to the 01 December, meant that driving tests were only available to those involved in essential services, including essential retail work. While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety must remain of paramount importance. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog </p>  <p>  My Department has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the RSA has also rehired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased within current health constraints. Due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened.  Following experience of managing the tests under Covid restrictions, this was increased to six in mid-September. This may be raised to 7, depending on health assurance, but not until January 2021 at the earliest.</p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.  It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.  </p></reply>

We need to ensure a holistic, multi-modal approach toward transport planning and provision and, importantly, we need to see finalised transport strategies integrated into relevant land-use plans and acting as a catalyst for the adoption by local authorities of a much more sustainable approach toward the location of housing, employment and other centres of transport demand.</p><p>Transport infrastructure planning is by its nature long-term and that is why the Strategy has a twenty year horizon. However, obviously strategies need to be reviewed and updated from time-to-time in order to ensure their continuing validity. </p><p>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the Strategy must be reviewed every six years. I am informed that the NTA has commenced that work already with a view to launching a public consultation next year. </p><p>In reviewing the Strategy the NTA will consider issues such as expanding DART services to operate on the Kildare line, which will help to tackle congestion problems that exist in the County.</p></reply>

Following the transition period, the potential then exists for arrangements to be made under those Acts and Ireland will be pursuing this option.

In light of this, the State Airports have facilitated the location of private testing providers at Cork, Shannon and Dublin Airports. The testing facilities in question are open to any member of the public requesting a Covid-19 test, whether travelling or not.</p>  <p>  Neither the State Airports nor my Department have any operational role in the provision of the testing services. </p>  <p>  The daa facilitates two commercial companies &ndash; Randox and RocDoc - to operate separate Covid-19 testing facilities at Dublin and Cork airports. RocDoc provide services at Shannon Airport also. These testing service providers have advised daa and the Shannon Airport Authority concerning headline figures for testing to date and projected bookings leading up to Christmas, including pre-departures, post-arrivals tests and other non-travel tests.</p>  <p>  There have been over 5,000 bookings for Covid-19 tests across both testing service providers since testing facilities opened in November at Cork Airport and at Dublin Airport. The testing service providers expect circa 800 bookings per day between now and the Dec 20th, increasing to circa 1,700 bookings on the expected busiest travel day, December 23rd. In the region of 500 Covid-19 tests have been carried out by the private testing provider located at Shannon Airport.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the estimated figures I have provided do not reflect the full extent of Covid-19 testing for prospective arriving (or departing) passengers, given that many other commercial providers outside of the airport&rsquo;s testing facilities also provide such services.  </p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring forward the relevant provisions to amend primary legislation in relation to so-called e-sccoters and other Powered Personal Transport devices (PPTs) when the Oireachtas is considering the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill early next year, in accordance with the Programme for Government. My officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters will remain illegal on public roads and in public places.</p></reply>

A first-time purchaser is an individual who, at the time of making a claim under the scheme, has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.  </p><p>In a case where an individual who received a gift of or inherited a house previously, the individual may still be considered a first-time buyer for the purposes of the HTB scheme subject to all other conditions being satisfied, on the basis that they have not previously purchased a dwelling, as the wording of the legislation provides. </p><p>Unless the existing owner received the house as a gift or inherited the property, they would not be considered a &ldquo;first time purchaser&rdquo;.</p><p>Section 477C also defines a qualifying residence.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling.  Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for HTB. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. </p><p>The Revenue Tax and Duty manual Part 15-01-</p><p>46 Help to Buy outlines further guidance on the scheme.</p><p>I have no plans to change these terms of the scheme. </p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.  </p><p>Details of CRSS were published in the Finance Bill 2020 and detailed operational guidelines on the scheme have been published on the Revenue website at: <i></i>.  </p><p>Travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  It is also not sufficient that a business is experiencing a reduction in demand for its goods or services because of Covid-19. To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, a business must, under the specific terms of the regulations, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing its business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that, during the period of restrictions, turnover does not exceed an amount based on 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business).</p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as a tour operator, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria. </p><p>Where a language school carries on a trade, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions apply, it may qualify for CRSS provided all eligibility criteria are met. Whether a language school&rsquo;s activities are in the nature of a trade will depend on the particular facts of the case. </p><p>To be eligible to claim under CRSS a language school must, under specific terms of Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the premises in which the business of the language school is ordinarily carried on, with the result that it has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. </p><p>Under nationwide Level 5 restrictions, which applied from 22 October 2020 to 1 December 2020, non-essential businesses were required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises. Higher and further education providers were however allowed to have an onsite presence where such education activities could not be held remotely. </p><p>Language schools may have been eligible to register and claim for CRSS during this period where all the qualification criteria were met. In determining whether the eligibility requirement relating to reduction in turnover is met, any turnover derived from a language school&rsquo;s online activities during the period of restrictions must be taken into account.</p><p>There has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively. A language school that was eligible to claim under CRSS up to 1 December could from that date open without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises where it was considered necessary for educational reasons for students to attend in person. Any such language school would therefore cease to be eligible to claim under CRSS from that date.  However, a business reopening after the period of restrictions, will be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist the business in meeting the costs of reopening. </p><p>Any business that can reopen without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to their business premises, but chooses not to reopen, will not be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p></reply>

These guidelines relate to how banks treat loans that have availed of payment breaks for regulatory purposes. These guidelines were previously in force until 30 September 2020. </p><p>In September, the T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met with the retail banks and the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) who agreed to provide suitable supports, both short term and longer term, to borrowers who are experiencing difficulties on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Many borrowers can and are returning to a position where they can repay their loans; however, many borrowers will be unable to return to full repayments, and these borrowers will require further support. Payment breaks are available on a case-by-case basis as one of a suite of measures lenders offer to customers facing difficulties. The different lenders have options in place to support borrowers including for business borrowers and mortgage holders. These include interest only, partial payments or breaks to payments if appropriate.</p><p>Each lender will show flexibility and borrowers who need help with repayments or have concerns about their abilities to repay loans should contact their lender in the first instance.

The Central Bank outlined its expectations to all lenders on how they should be supporting borrowers who are experiencing financial distress arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, and is supervising lenders to ensure that these expectations are met.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. Details of CRSS were published in the Finance Bill 2020 and detailed operational guidelines on the scheme have been published on the Revenue website at:  .  </p><p>Businesses whose trading profits are exempt from the charge to tax under Case I of Schedule D do not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS.  </p><p>A sports club that has been granted a sports body exemption (an approved sports body) is exempt from paying Corporation Tax or Income tax on any income received where the income is used for the purpose of promoting the game or sport. Such income would include income from a bar registered under the Clubs Act 1904 by a sports club. As an approved sports body is not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D in respect of its trading profits, it will not qualify for CRSS. An approved sports bodies is not exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) or payroll taxes and may be entitled to financial support under other measures put in place by the Government, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  An approved sports body may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities and any excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>A sports club that does not have a sports body exemption and which has income, for example from a gym, bar or restaurant trade, subject to tax under Case I of Schedule D may be eligible for CRSS for periods of restrictions where that business meets the qualification criteria for the scheme. Under nationwide Level 5 restrictions which applied from 22 October 2020 to 1 December 2020, gyms, bars and restaurants were required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and therefore such businesses would have been eligible to register and claim for CRSS were the qualification criteria was met. </p><p>There has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively.  Since 1 December, gyms have been allowed to reopen for individual use and from 4 December, cafes, restaurants and bars which serve substantial meals prepared onsite are allowed to open for indoor dining. In most cases therefore, a gym, restaurant or bar serving substantial meals prepared on site, operating from the sports club premises were no longer required to prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises from 1<sup>st</sup>or 4<sup>th</sup>December as appropriate, and therefore do not qualify for CRSS from that date. </p><p>Where a business is reopening after a period of restrictions, they will be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist the business in meeting the costs of reopening.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.</p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.</p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p><p>On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence from the 1st January 2021 in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  </p><p>I consider this to be an interim solution only. While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions apply.</p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor insurance cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the driver&rsquo;s age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the storage location. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies. The Deputy should also note that such actuarial data is confidential to each insurer and is not made available to my Department.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I can assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key policy priority as reflected in the Programme for Government. A Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment was established by Government to oversee insurance reform implementation.  This is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes as standing members, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming. </p>  <p>  The Sub-Group has prepared an Action Plan for Insurance Reform, which was published by the Government last week. This Action Plan contains 66 actions across a number of Government Departments which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations.  Actions will be undertaken and delivered by Ministers in the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Justice over the next 18 months. The Sub-Group on Insurance Reform within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery will meet regularly, engage with stakeholders and publish progress of the actions every six months.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of motor insurance more specifically, I would draw his attention to data from the recent second National Claims Information Database Private Motor Insurance Report from the Central Bank. This shows that, after peaking in Q2 2018, the average earned premium for private motor insurance decreased by 9 per cent up to the end of 2019. I would reasonably expect that the next year&rsquo;s report will show further reductions in the average earned premiums for private motor insurance into 2020.  Separately, the Central Statistics Office in its recent November Consumer Price Index private motor insurance component shows that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by almost a third from their July 2016 peak. While for methodological reasons, these datasets are not directly comparable, both have indicated the same downward trend for some time.</p></reply>

The scheme provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and gross pay to employees.</p><p>- To qualify for the EWSS, as well as having tax clearance, an employer must be able to show that:</p><p>- the business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 July and 31 December 2020, and</p><p>- Covid-19 is the cause of this disruption.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the turnover test is capable of being applied in the case of the business concerned. It appears from submissions made to Revenue by the business concerned that a reduction of 30% in &lsquo;turnover&rsquo; or &lsquo;customer orders&rsquo; between 01 July and 31 December 2020 (compared to the same period in 2019) is not expected and the eligibility criteria for the scheme will not be met and the company is, therefore, not eligible for the scheme.</p><p>For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.</p><p>Payment Service Providers are obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. Strong Customer Authentication under PSD2 requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. SCA is a combination of something you know (a password or PIN), something you have (a card reader or token generator) and something you are (a fingerprint).</p><p>In an Opinion published on 16 October 2019 the European Banking Authority (EBA) set the final deadline for full compliance with SCA requirements at 31 December 2020. The EBA felt that this time should be sufficient for issuing and acquiring payment service providers and their merchants to migrate to SCA-compliant approaches and solutions.</p><p>Following the outbreak of Covid-19 earlier this year industry bodies from across the EU, including the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), wrote to the EU Commission and the EBA seeking a further extension to the deadline for compliance with the SCA requirements. They outlined that Covid-19 was clearly having an impact on all sectors of the EU economy and that industry was unlikely to be able to meet the current deadline of 31 December 2020 for SCA migration.</p><p>On 8 December, in an effort to avoid significant disruption to payments, the BPFI announced plans for an industry ramp-up approach for the implementation of SCA. This approach means that payment card issuers will gradually ramp-up to full adoption of SCA, this ramp-up will incorporate value thresholds and the implementation of soft declines when processing card payments. This does not mean that payments for values below the ramp-up thresholds will all be approved and transactions will continue to be closely monitored for possible fraud. </p><p>Where a regulated payment service provider (PSP) is in a position to implement the requirements with effect from 1 January 2021, the Central Bank of Ireland expects them to do so, in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.</p><p>Through engagements with regulated PSPs on the progress of their SCA migration plans, the Central Bank is aware of some issues around the full implementation of SCA by 31 December 2020. The Central Bank has communicated to these PSPs that they are required to implement the Requirements as soon as possible in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.</p><p>As the deadline for SCA implementation approaches, Department officials will continue to work with the Central Bank and BPFI to minimise possible payment disruption experienced by consumers and merchants. </p></reply>

The PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and, thus, is chargeable to income tax, but exempt from the USC and PRSI charges.  This will be the case whether, prior to receipt of the PUP, the recipient was a PAYE worker or a self-employed individual.</p><p>The formal taxation arrangements for the PUP are being legislated for in Finance Bill 2020 and the legislation reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare benefits, including jobseekers benefit for the self-employed, which is to tax the benefits on an actual basis under Schedule E.  In the absence of these changes, the payments would be taxable under Case IV of Schedule D, which would also be on an actual basis.  </p><p>Being taxed on an actual basis means that for each tax year, recipients of the PUP are taxed on the payments that are actually received in the corresponding calendar year.  This is the case regardless of the period for which a self-employed individual carrying on a trade or profession prepares his or her accounts for that trade or profession.  </p><p>Revenue advise that self-employed individuals would be covered under the debt warehousing facility. </p><p>Self-assessed individuals, i.e. chargeable persons, who have income from non-PAYE sources are obliged to file a tax return and account for all their income including the PUP in their tax return.  This is the case whether or not such individuals were in receipt of the PUP.  </p><p>The 2020 tax return would be due to be filed by 31st October 2021, and any balance of tax owing would normally be due to be paid at the same time.</p><p>However, there is also a provision in the Finance Bill which expands the debt warehousing scheme to include taxpayers who self-assess for income tax.  The scheme is available to any self-assessed taxpayer who expects that her/his income for 2020 will be more than 25% lower than her/his income for 2019 and as a result s/he is unable to pay the balance of income tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax 2020.</p><p>Where a taxpayer is eligible for warehousing, collection of these liabilities may be suspended for a period of 12 months from 31 October / 10 December, as appropriate.  Warehoused liabilities will be subject to no interest for this 12 month period and a reduced interest rate of c. 3% per annum thereafter until paid in full. </p><p>If income for 2021 is also more than 25% lower than income for 2019, the balance of 2020 Income Tax and Preliminary Tax for 2021 may be warehoused. </p></reply>

I understand that the anomaly suggested by the Deputy does not arise and that Revenue has confirmed the position in its published guidance.</p>  <p>  The loss relief can be of relevance to both businesses liable to income tax (such as sole traders) and those liable to corporation tax.</p>  <p>Dealing with income tax first, section 10 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 introduced a new Chapter 2A &lsquo;Income tax: Covid-19 loss relief&rsquo; in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&lsquo;TCA 1997&rsquo;). This provides for a number of temporary income tax measures to assist self-employed individuals. Section 395A TCA 1997 provides for income tax relief for losses incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 by individuals carrying on a trade or profession, either as sole traders or in partnerships. Where a self-employed individual incurs losses in a basis period ending in 2021, relief will be available where part of those losses were incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the section provides that where, in a tax year, an individual carrying on a trade or profession:</p>  <p>  - incurs a loss which would be available to carry forward to the following tax year, and</p>  <p>  - all or part of the loss is incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020,</p>  <p>  then the individual may claim to have any part of the loss that is incurred in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 carried back and set off against the profits of the same trade or profession for the tax year 2019. </p>  <p>  This is a once-off measure targeted at otherwise viable businesses that were profitable in 2019 but who have incurred losses in 2020 as a result of the initial response to Covid-19 pandemic.  It is not an on-going loss relief measure, so the look back period solely relating to 2019 as the pre-pandemic period is appropriate in this context.  Further, the provision made in the July Stimulus Package of &euro;150m relating to the estimated 280,000 potential beneficiaries was based on this approach.</p>  <p>  Subject to meeting certain conditions, self-employed individuals may make an interim claim for relief in respect of an estimated amount of the relief that will be due to them under section 395A. Similar provisions apply in respect of unused capital allowances relating to the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The maximum amount of relief that an individual may claim in respect of losses and capital allowances is capped at &euro;25,000.  Revenue have published examples of the operation of the relief in the Tax and Duty Manual Part 12-01-03, which is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>Turning now to corporation tax, section 11 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 introduced a new section 396D in the TCA 1997. The provision allows companies, subject to certain conditions, to make a claim to carry back up to 50% of their estimated trading losses incurred in an accounting period, which contains some or all of the period 1 March to 31 December 2020, against their profits of the preceding accounting period. </p>  <p>  Under normal rules, this carry back would not take place until up to nine months after the end of the loss-making accounting period, when the corporation tax return is filed. The accelerated corporation tax loss relief allows claims to be made (and revised if necessary) at any time from four months into the loss-making accounting period and up to five months after the end of that accounting period. This significantly accelerates the tax repayments to companies that can be generated from the offset of these losses against previously taxed profits. The balance of the loss will be available for carry back in due course under normal rules, when accounts have been prepared after the end of the company&rsquo;s accounting period and a corporation tax return has been filed. </p>  <p>  Therefore, provided it satisfies the relevant conditions, a company with a 12-month accounting period ending in 2021 will be allowed to project the trading loss that it expects to suffer in its 2021 tax year and to lodge an early claim for carry-back of half of that expected loss against taxable profits of its 2020 tax year. Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty Manual Part 12-03-05, which is published on Revenue&rsquo;s website, contains examples in this regard.</p></reply>

Given that this process of unwinding of FEMPI pay reductions will be ongoing over 2021 to 2022 as per sections 19 and 20 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017,  the requirement for equitable treatment, as outlined above, will continue to arise over this period.

The OPW does not undertake market valuations on the entire collection. Valuations are undertaken on individual items for insurance purposes when such items are placed on loan to third parties or external exhibitions.  The State Art Collection is measured by its cultural and heritage significance not its financial value and therefore fluctuations in the art market do not alter its value.  </p><p>The OPW Art Management Office undertakes routine surveys of artworks for which it has responsibility in State owned buildings.  These audits take place through a programme of spot-checks and they are conducted on a regular basis as part of the day-to-day management of the collection. Artworks are on display in 480 locations around the country and over 90% of the collection is out on loan.  Every artwork in the State Art Collection is given a unique number and photographed before it is placed on loan. The data obtained from the collection surveys is registered on an art database.  </p><p>In 2020, the Art Management Office commenced a major collection management project to improve its control systems. This project involved migration of data and images from a database that has been in use since the mid-1990s to a new collection management system.  Phase 1 of the migration project has been completed recently and Phase 2 is currently underway. Phase 2 involves extensive checking of over 17,000 records transferred from the old database. Each record contains an image of the artwork and multiple data fields, including location. All fields in each record have to be checked to ensure that the information catalogued on every artwork is correct and up-to-date. Until this process has been completed, it is not possible to provide an accurate schedule of items. Phase 2 is due for completion in June 2021. </p><p>Since the early 1990s, the OPW has not had responsibility for placing artworks on display in State owned properties abroad.  However, some 600 artworks acquired by the OPW prior to this period remain on loan to 41 embassies abroad. A small number of these artworks have been placed on loan in recent years. </p><p>As the database project is underway currently and checking is not complete, it is not possible to provide accurate information dating back to 2010 at present.  It can be confirmed that no thefts of artworks have been reported to the Art Management Office from January 2020 to-date.</p></reply>

No 252/2019) and introduced to Scheme members by way of D/PER Circular 15/2019 with effect from 1 October 2019.   </p>  <p>  The vast majority of public servants recruited since 1 January 2013 in approximately 350 Relevant Authorities (public service bodies responsible for the administration of the Scheme) are members of the Single Scheme.  Each Relevant Authority is legally responsible for administering the Single Scheme for its own staff who are members of the Scheme, including in relation to the purchase and transfer of retirement benefits.  My Department does not hold the data requested by the Deputy in relation to purchases by Scheme members in other Relevant Authorities.  In my own Department, however, where I have legal responsibility for the administration of the Scheme for employees, I understand that, although no Scheme member from the Department entered into a contract for purchase in the period in question, an application from one employee is currently being processed. </p>  <p>  The purchase and transfer facility was developed around the particular features of the Single Scheme, which operates on the basis of pension credits and retirement lump sum credits, called &ldquo;referable amounts&rdquo; accruing as percentages of pay throughout a Scheme member&rsquo;s career.  The facility operates on a cost neutral basis for both the Exchequer and individual Scheme members alike.  It offers Scheme members the opportunity to purchase extra pension and/or retirement lump sum credits in multiples of &euro;1 in pension and/or &euro;1 in lump sum, subject to specific individual limits, as provided for in the Circular.  The main purpose of the limits is to ensure, as far as possible, that Revenue rules in relation to retirement benefits are observed.  The structure of the Single Scheme is significantly different to the structure of the pre-existing public service pension schemes, where retirement benefits are generally based on pensionable remuneration at retirement and reckonable, pensionable service. </p>  <p>  The purchase and transfer facility under the Single Scheme operates on the basis of annual contracts.  A Scheme member can enter into multiple purchase contracts over the period of his/her career, subject to complying with the limits set out in the Circular.  This gives the Scheme member the option to enter into a series of smaller purchases, rather than one large purchase, as is generally the case in relation to purchase of service under the pre-existing pension schemes.  For this reason, lump sum, rather than periodic purchase is provided for. </p>  <p>  My Department offers central support across key areas of Single Scheme administration to all Relevant Authorities by way of classroom based training and the provision of a dedicated website containing support materials for administrators and members of the Scheme.  Specific training courses were devised to help with the rollout of the purchase and transfer facility under D/PER Circular 15/2019 and these were well attended, with participants providing very positive feedback on the courses.  Due to the current Covid 19 pandemic, these training courses are being delivered by Webinar.  Administrator and Scheme member tools in relation to the operation of the purchase and transfer facility are available on the Single Scheme website to assist Scheme members and administrators.  An Administrator&rsquo;s calculator tool automatically calculates limits for an individual Scheme member and provides an estimate of the cost of purchase for that member.  There is also a tool on the website that Scheme members can use to automatically calculate the cost of purchase for themselves. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the structure of the Single Scheme purchase and transfer facility at this time.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. Under the Government's Framework for Restrictive Measures, children&rsquo;s sport has continued since the publication of the Recovery and Resilience Plan in September, subject to certain restrictions on activities indoors and outdoors. </p><p>Under Level 3 effective from 1<sup>st</sup>December the following measures apply to Children&rsquo;s sport:</p><p>- Outdoors: Non-contact training only in pods of up to 15.</p><p>- Indoors: Individual sports training only. This should be conducted in line with the guidance developed for indoor sport. No exercise or dance classes should take place.</p><p>In relation to whether sport takes place inside or outside the school setting, a clear distinction has to be made between sport, especially sport in the community, and PE lessons in schools. PE lessons involve a range of activities of which team and individual sports are just one component part. The guidance to schools published by the Department of Education advises that PE lessons should be timetabled as normal where possible during the Covid-19 pandemic, although modifications may have to be made to the range of activities undertaken. </p><p>While activities up to Grade 3 of the HPSC COVID-19 Interim recommendations for the return to sports activities for children and adolescents </p><p>() </p><p>may be possible depending on public health guidelines in effect at any particular time, individual activities and outdoor activities should be prioritised in PE lessons as these present less risk. </p><p>Detailed guidance has issued to post-primary schools with regard to how practical subjects, including PE, can continue during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>() </p><p>and schools should consult this document, particularly with regard to the list of activities that present a relatively low to moderate risk in PE lessons.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of a broader resumption of sport for both children and adults. In that context, my Department and Sport Ireland are engaging with the various sporting bodies to inform a review of the measures currently in place for sporting activity, which will be considered by Government early in the New Year. The issue of resuming competitions and leagues, which have a particular appeal for children, will form part of the review.</p></reply>

The exceptions for the Christmas period are designed to support people to have a meaningful Christmas, albeit different to other years. The main objective is to stay safe and keep the COVID-19 numbers down so that we can maintain the lowest possible level of restrictions into the New Year. While weddings with up to 25 guests are permitted additional restrictions include no live music. This includes live instrumental music.</p><p>In line with the <i>Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>the Government has, in recent months, framed restrictions to account for periods where there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally.  Throughout this period the Government has made special provision for weddings in view of the importance of these occasions to couples and the level of planning that is involved for couples and their families.</p><p>Each level of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time.  The risk level at this time has meant that some activities have not been permitted such as live music at weddings.  I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day and the impact on musicians and bands.  Nonetheless, the restrictions are informed by public health understanding of the disease, in particular how background noise and music can cause people to raise their voices and lean closer together.  </p></reply>

I understand that the CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health Regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In general, support provided under CRSS is intended to enable some businesses with business premises to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.</p><p>A range of measures was announced as part of Budget 2021 to support the arts and culture sectors and in particular the music and entertainment sectors.  In Ireland, the Government provides primary support for the arts, including the music sector, through the Arts Council.  Government funding to the Arts Council in 2021 will amount to &euro;130m which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020.  Much of this funding is being allocated to the music sector, including to many who have never before received funding from the Council.</p><p>In addition to the significant increase in Arts Council funding, the Government has allocated &euro;50 million specifically for live entertainment in 2021 and this will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector. Officials in my Department are engaged in a consultation process to allow stakeholders have an input into how this funding will be disbursed.  The operation of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme, which operated during the autumn and will shortly be completed, will provide insights for the allocation of the funding next year. </p><p>The response to and the demand for the Music Industry Stimulus Package and the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme, which was far in excess of what was anticipated, will also inform the Department in this regard. </p><p>There are a number of financial supports, training and guidance in place by Government to help business mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and work safely.

It will do this by providing for regulatory oversight by an Online Safety Commissioner of the systems that online services use to deliver and moderate user-generated content. This will include a compliance and enforcement framework of binding online safety codes, investigation and audit powers and sanctions for non-compliance.</p>  <p>  The Bill is designated to be as future proofed as possible. One of the ways it will do this is by providing for a category of harmful content that comprises "material which it is a criminal offence to disseminate&rdquo;. This means that rather than specifically set out particular pieces of criminal legislation that are encompassed in this category, all such legislation is included in the scope of this Bill. As  additional offences are enacted that relate to the dissemination of criminal content, such legislation will also come within scope without the need to constantly amend the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while the legislation does not specifically refer to image based sexual abuse material and online harassment, the category of "material which it is a criminal offence to disseminate" does encompass the following: </p>  <p>  - S. 5 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, regarding the dissemination of child sex abuse materials, and, </p>  <p>  - S. 10 of Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, regarding the offence of harassment. </p>  <p>  The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences (HHCRO) Bill, 2017, proposes to introduce new criminal offences regarding image based abuse and online harassment and to update the offence of harassment in s. 10 of the 1997 Act. The HHCRO Bill is due to be enacted shortly and its provisions will then also come within scope of this Bill. </p>  <p>  In all cases, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will remain the appropriate authority to investigate individual instances of criminal material online and refer alleged perpetrators for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. What the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will do is ensure that there is appropriate oversight of the systems that designated online services have in place to deal with such content.</p></reply>

The core responsibilities include the regulation and administration of the foreshore through a system of leasing and licensing.</p><p>There has been a substantial increase in both the volume of foreshore consent applications and the complexity of these applications, particularly with regard to large infrastructural projects.</p><p>Foreshore consent can only be granted by my Department if it is in the public interest.  At present, the processing of a foreshore consent application includes the following:</p><p>- assessment of the application by the Department&rsquo;s internal technical advisers, </p><p>- consultation with statutory and non-statutory consultees, including relevant Departments and Agencies;</p><p>- a period of public consultation, normally 30 calendar days;</p><p>- valuation of the site to be occupied by the applicant;</p><p>- assessment of the application by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee which advises on scientific matters;</p><p>- other public interest elements that may arise in particular cases; and</p><p>- obtaining necessary legal advice in complex legal cases from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction, where appropriate.</p><p>The prioritisation of applications, based on a scheme of priorities and active case management through all stages of the process, has led to efficiencies in processing applications. </p><p>In January 2020, my Department published the finalised General Scheme of the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill, which will provide the legislative basis for Ireland's new marine planning regime.  In addition to the legislative underpinning for forward planning provided through the National Marine Planning Framework, the MPDM Bill will also provide: a new State consent regime for the entire maritime area replacing foreshore consenting; development consenting integration into the planning permission system; and robust compliance and enforcement measures. </p><p>The commitment in the Programme for Government to enactment in nine months reflects the priority it has been accorded.  </p><p>Further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p>MPDM Bill:  .</p><p>National Marine Planning Framework: .</p></reply>

The Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business planning funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.  In regard to overall investment, the Programme for Government states that the Government will fund Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.  This overall funding commitment is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure, including those aspects which are subject to European Commission infringement action.</p><p>Irish Water is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator. The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs.  This CRU process involves, <i>inter alia</i>, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its investment plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods.</p><p>As a regulated utility, overall Irish Water expenditure is therefore subject to approval by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, while in turn the funding provided by the Exchequer to Irish Water in relation to domestic water services is subject to the annual Budget and Estimates process.  The voted provision of over &euro;1.3 billion included in my Department's 2021 Estimates in respect of Irish Water&rsquo;s domestic water services operational and capital expenditure in 2021 is provided with respect to the CRU determination of Irish Water approved revenue.</p><p>Further detail in relation to the breakdown of Irish Water's capital investment should be sought from Irish Water.  It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email at Oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually.  The measure applies to new and existing tenancies.  This means that it applies when rents are set at the start of a tenancy and when rents are set during a rent review in respect of an ongoing tenancy, unless otherwise exempted. </p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;</p><p>or</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure, or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning.  A protected structure is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 Act provides a legal definition of &lsquo;substantial change in the nature of rental accommodation&rsquo; to illustrate the type of works to be carried out to a rental property to qualify for an exemption from the annual rent increase restriction applicable in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). </p><p>  Such works shall result in:</p><p>- a permanent extension increasing the floor area by 25%; or </p><p>- an improvement in the Building Energy Rating (BER) by at least 7 ratings; or </p><p>- at least 3 of the following:</p><p>- a permanent alteration of the internal layout;  </p><p>- adaptations for a person with a disability;</p><p>- a permanent increase in the number of rooms;</p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 3 or more ratings where the original BER was D1 or lower; or</p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 2 or more ratings where the original BER was C3 or higher</p><p>and the aforementioned works do not solely consist of works carried out for the purposes of compliance with the minimum standards in rented accommodation, as prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019. </p><p>Under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019, the expiry date of all deemed and designated RPZs was extended to 31 December 2021.  The restrictions have had a moderating effect on rent increases and have provided a measure of certainty for landlords and tenants alike, with regard to medium-term rent levels.  The operation of the RPZ provisions are kept under constant review by the Housing Agency and by my Department.</p><p>A Rent Pressure Zone calculator is available on the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) website at: , to assist landlords and tenants in determining if their dwelling is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to calculate the maximum rent increase permitted for their dwelling, considering the current rent and the time elapsed since the last review of rent.</p><p>Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) where they believe that the rent increase is in excess of the market rent or, if applicable, does not comply with the Rent Predictability Measure.  </p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at www.housing.gov.ie, by searching 'rent pressure zones'.  <b></b></p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020.  The three Orders had the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines, including for draft development plan processes such as consultation, by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks during the time period in which they have effect.  Since then, further measures have been put in place and are progressing through the legislative process, to ensure that the planning system can continue to function during the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument No. 448 of 2020 identified planning-related activity within the schedule of what is considered to be &lsquo;essential services&rsquo; and so the work of the planning system has continued during more recent periods of national restriction in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  New legislative provisions are currently being brought through the Oireachtas, which will allow for specific measures in relation to the planning system to be, possibly, taken in a public health emergency.  While such measures will allow an extension of statutory timelines in certain circumstances, it is not, however, envisaged that these would apply more broadly in the way that Section 251A was applied, nor would they be generally applied in the circumstances of Level 5 restrictions, where planning is classified as an essential service.  </p>  <p>  Rather, they seek to provide some protections for example, if planning staffing resources in a particular authority were compromised by sick absences due to Covid-19.  The current legislative proposals also enable the initial stage of public consultation at the outset of the development plan process to be undertaken on-line, where considered necessary.</p>  <p>  With regard to public participation in the process of making or varying a County Development Plan, and in particular in relation to the draft plan and material alterations display stages, all local authorities must continue to operate to satisfy statutory requirements, in accordance within public health guidance and related operating procedures that have been put in place.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that under Section 12(16) of the Act, the validity of a development plan may not be questioned by reason only that certain procedures were not completed within the timeframes set out in the Act.  While this may allow for some flexibility in terms of timing, more practically, I understand that Local Authorities are implementing innovative solutions to ensure that public consultation requirements can and are being satisfied.  </p>  <p>  Obviously the current circumstances have presented challenges, which have required us to examine how essential work can be advanced in a safe manner, including public participation.  However, I am particularly mindful of the important role that the planning and development system plays in supporting the economic development of the country, and the vital role which it will play in supporting social and economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons, including those with disabilities, for social housing support and the allocation of that support are matters solely for the local authority concerned.  As Minister, I am precluded by law from becoming involved in individual cases. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability, which has been extended to 2021 Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) have been established in all housing authority areas, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  </p>  <p>  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local housing strategies for people with disabilities to meet identified and emerging need over the five years of their term.  These Plans, which are available on the relevant local authority websites, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms.</p></reply>

The <i>National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy</i>, published in 2018, contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports available to owners to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p>- The Repair and Leasing  Scheme (RLS) is to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  I have recently announced an increase in the funding limit for the refurbishment of properties from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000.  Since its introduction the scheme has facilitated 185 homes being brought back into use and tenanted.  The amount of RLS claims paid to end Q2 2020 is &euro;4,306,986.</p><p>- The Buy and Renew initiative particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community with the added value of delivery social housing units.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased.  Since its introduction it has facilitated local authorities to deliver circa 600<b></b>vacant properties for social housing purposes.  The amount of spent on the Buy and Renew scheme since its introduction is &euro;112.7m.</p><p>- In  addition, in December 2018 my Department published the Bringing Back Homes Manual for the  Reuse of Existing Buildings.  Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses.  The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download at: .</p><p>To support this work at local authority level, my Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office.  The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority.  The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority.</p></reply>

This year, we are seeing a reduction in the numbers of people in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  The total number of homeless adults in the south-west region fell by 107, or 18%, between October 2019 and October 2020.  The number of homeless families in the region fell by 65, or 48%, over the same period.  While these homeless figures are still too high, it is important to acknowledge the progress being made by local authorities and their service delivery partners in the NGO sector in this area.  The most recent data show that family homelessness continues to fall nationally and is now at the lowest level seen since June 2016.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and includes specific measures to address these needs.  These include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring that there is dedicated funding and resources to deliver the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a priority for me and for this Government.  The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds.  In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.  The increased targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land.</p></reply>

These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. It is my intention that an examination of local authority funding baselines will be considered in this context next year. In the meantime, local authority members had various tools available to them as part of the recent local authority budget process, including the LPT local adjustment factor, that they could have used to increase the funding available to their local authority and to support the delivery of services in the area.</p></reply>

In January 2013, UNESCO revised the criteria for Biosphere Reserve status.  To meet criteria for UNESCO Biosphere reserves under Article 4 of the Seville Strategy, Kerry County Council with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department submitted a successful application extending the Killarney National Park UNESCO Biosphere Reserve to include areas hydrologically and ecologically connected to the existing Core Area. The newly defined UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is known as the Kerry UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.</p><p>The National Park forms the &ldquo;Core Area&rdquo; of the UNESCO Kerry Biosphere Reserve. While NPWS take the in lead with regard to the core area, Kerry County Council is  the lead partner for the overall Biosphere Reserve which extends far beyond the National Park itself. The wider Biosphere areas are generally not in State ownership but are hydrologically linked and have habitat connectivity with the Core Area of the Biosphere (Killarney National Park).</p><p>In terms  of actions undertaken in the wider Biosphere, Kerry County Council, is  best placed to respond to the Deputy in terms of actions undertaken. The Council have, through the South Kerry Development Partnership, appointed a dedicated Biosphere Officer. One of the Biosphere Officer's first initiatives was to organise an Autumn Event Series in the Kerry Biosphere Reserve.  During this event series, a strategic initiative was launched in partnership with UNESCO Kerry Biosphere Reserve, Creative Ireland Kerry and the EPA.  &ldquo;Our Plant, Your Biosphere&rdquo; aimed to promote citizen well-being through arts and heritage engagement with the native habitats and species of the Kerry Biosphere Reserve and to raise awareness of the part we as stewards of the land play in protecting nature and biodiversity. </p><p>The MacGillycuddy Reeks European Innovation Partnership (EIP) Project aims to improve the sustainability and economic viability of farming in the MacGillycuddy Reeks. This will be done through the development of practical, achievable actions and innovative solutions in order to improve the condition of the habitats of this unique Natura 2000 area, in close conjunction with the landowners/farmers in the area. The MacGillycuddy Reeks Project is an EIP (European Innovation Partnership) Locally Led Scheme. The Project is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. If you would like to find out more about our project please refer to: .</p><p>The Biosphere Officer has also begun engaging with local businesses to develop sustainable business partnerships in the Region and plans to develop a Business Charter are moving apace. The Biosphere Partnership is in its infancy and yet, despite the challenges presented by Covid 19, the Biosphere Officer has made considerable impact in respect of her outreach programmes. The Biosphere Officer is finalising a programme for 2021 and can be contacted at kerrybiosphere@skdp.net. </p></reply>

We also joined a statement of the co-chairs of the United Nations Group of Friends for the Protection of Journalists, which expressed profound concern over the deteriorating situation of human rights in Belarus, including multiple reports of harassment, arbitrary arrests, intensifying persecution and detention of journalists and media workers, as well as the human rights defenders and other members of the Belarusian civil society.</p>  <p>  The individual in question has been detained, along with many others, for their political views. The EU delegation in Minsk follows the situation closely and we are kept appraised of developments in relation to detainees.

We will continue to make our voice heard on this, both within the EU and in other international bodies. </p>  <p>  The credible reports of torture and ill-treatment, including of the individual in questions, are extremely worrying.

We have been clear that the violence must stop. </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided funding for a project in Belarus that seeks to support the protection of media freedoms through the European Endowment for Democracy and we will continue to use our voice in international settings to call for the persecution of journalists to end. </p></reply>

I made a statement on 1 July to express Ireland's concern in relation to the adoption of this law, and the situation has been raised directly with the Chinese Ambassador to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The EU has made a number of statements in relation to this situation, most recently on 12 November following the disqualification of members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. This statement reiterated our concern regarding Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy under the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Council of the EU adopted Conclusions on Hong Kong on 28 July 2020 in response to the adoption of the National Security Law. These set out a coordinated package of response measures in various fields, including the operation of Member States' extradition agreements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong. </p>  <p>  In line with these Conclusions, the Government agreed on 13 October to suspend Ireland's Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  This decision, which was taken in concert with a number of other EU Member States, clearly signals Ireland's concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the erosion of judicial independence promised under the One Country, Two Systems principle.</p>  <p>  The matter was discussed last week at the EU Foreign Affairs Council where Ministers agreed on their assessment of the situation, which has been strongly deteriorating, and as a minimum will continue to implement the Council Conclusions from July 2020, expressing political support for Hong Kong's autonomy under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle. </p>  <p>  Hong Kong maintains a legislative approach to its financial system aimed at combating money laundering. As far as my Department is aware, no Irish citizens or businesses have been affected by the freezing of bank accounts related to pro-democracy protests. My Department, through our Consulate General in Hong Kong and our Embassy in Beijing, will remain alert to the situation in Hong Kong and, along with our EU partners, will continue to raise our concerns with Chinese authorities.</p></reply>

As part of this work,  the Government has published Brexit Contingency Plans in December, 2018, July 2019 and most recently in September 2109.</p>  <p>  Our September 2019, Brexit Readiness Action Plan outlines in substantive detail the changes that will arise at the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December.  It provides information on the actions Government is taking and the steps that citizens and businesses should take to mitigate the risks that arise from these changes. </p>  <p>  All Departments and Agencies continue their intensive preparation for the end of the transition period. This work takes account of two scenarios, a limited FTA (including fisheries) or a hard Brexit with the EU and UK trading on WTO terms. This includes overseeing work for which they have direct responsibility as well at outreach to the specific stakeholders to assist them.  All this work is support by a comprehensive communications programme including TV, radio, media and social media advertising.  </p>  <p>  Our Readiness work is overseen at official level by the Assistant Secretaries group on Brexit readiness, co-chaired by an official from my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach, meets on a weekly basis and manages the whole-of-Government readiness agenda. All relevant Departments and Agencies report in to this group on their work in areas such as trade flows, support for trades, infrastructure, connectivity and transport, services, sectoral issues such as data and energy, communications and outreach and legislation.  This group reports to the Secretaries General group chaired by the Secretary General to the Government.  </p>  <p>  I, and other Ministers, are briefed on an ongoing basis and provide regular updates to the Government on the status of our Brexit readiness work. I did so most recently on 8 December. We also, as the Deputy is aware, brief the Oireachtas on an ongoing basis.  I will be updating the D&aacute;il on Thursday 17 December during Statements on Brexit Readiness.</p>  <p>  Departments will use the remaining 16 days to refine their readiness work and support their stakeholders. Plans are being finalized by relevant Departments and Agencies for the provision of helplines and call centres over the initial period after the transition. </p>  <p>  I have always been very clear that Brexit means disruption and change and that the seamless nature of trade between the EU and UK will no longer be possible.  The Government has undertaken a significant amount of work to mitigate the risks for business and citizens.  However, not all risks can be mitigated as a number are outside are control.  However, we will continue in the remaining days and into next year to work with all stakeholders in addressing the challenges Brexit brings.</p></reply>

A judgment is currently awaited in this case. Any further decision may be appealed before Nigeria&rsquo;s Federal Court of Appeal.</p>  <p>  Ireland works bilaterally, within the European Union, and with UN partners to promote and protect human rights including the rights of the child and freedom of religion or belief for all. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria regularly engages on human rights issues with other EU Member States in Nigeria, and with the Nigerian authorities.

If a proposed military overflight does not meet these criteria, blanket clearance does not apply and advance permission must be sought.  The standard conditions would then apply, and these do not permit carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, or engaging in intelligence gathering of forming part of military exercises of operations.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school</p><p>Following updated health advice from NPHET on 18th August, which was that post-primary services are required to operate using 50% of passenger capacity, Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of this public health recommendation is achieved as quickly as possible on all post-primary services. Based on the analysis conducted by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which were based on a full academic year, the estimated costs ranged between an estimated &euro;87m to &euro;135m taking into account a range of rates and a range of potential solutions from re-organising or upgrading existing services to  the requirement to go to the market to source all additional vehicles required. </p><p>In relation to the level of vehicular traffic bringing children to school, a review of the school transport scheme has been anounced with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review have been drafted and a Steering Group has been established. </p><p>Due to the current evolving situation with Covid-19 and the continued restrictions the work of the Steering Group has been delayed. It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. </p><p>The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme;<i></i>and examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.</p></reply>

To date the evidence demonstrates that schools are operating safely supported by significant investment to support all infection prevention and control measures recommended by the public health authorities.  </p>  <p>  The low numbers are a tribute to the strong adherence by schools to the public health recommendations for safely reopening schools.  The testing and positivity rates in schools for close contacts also reflect the current international position that schools are not key drivers of Covid-19 in the community. </p>  <p>  In terms of what happens when a child attending school tests positive, the HSE will inform the school principal if the child was in the school in the infectious period regardless of parental consent.  In these circumstances the HSE will conduct a Public Health Risk Assessment with the school principal. This is usually undertaken the same day they are notified, but it may be the following day. </p>  <p>  Public Health will work with the school principal to identify the close contacts and all close contact will be informed and scheduled for testing and asked to restrict their movements. Parent/guardians will be informed if their child is a close contact.  </p>  <p>  The wider school community can be informed that the school is working with public health who are guiding the school through the actions they need to take to protect staff, pupils and the school community.  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, Public Health HSE. All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.</p>  <p>  Schools are working hard to implement the public health advice which is proving to be effective in keeping transmission levels in schools so low. All recommendations are being kept under review by consultants / specialists in Public Health as we continue to deal with the ongoing pandemic.</p></reply>

These provisions including the requirement for schools to set out arrangements for students that do not wish to attend religious instruction, apply to the admission processes for the 2021/2022 school year onwards. Circular 7/2020, (Commencement of Certain Sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018) requires each school authority to familiarise themselves with the requirements of the act and to have in place the necessary policy, procedures and practices to ensure compliance with it. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school.

Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc.</p></reply>

As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment, I have met with a wide range of representative associations and advocates from the Special Education Sector. All of these groups have raised very important issues in relation to how they consider that improvements can be made to special education services. </p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of the investment in special education and the supports which have been put in place, I am also very conscious that there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p>  <p>  NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others to bring the required additional special education placements on stream. Accordingly, I have referred the question to the NCSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education and I want to reassure you that the delivery of the necessary additional provision is being progressed as an absolute priority.</p></reply>

This project has been devolved to the school for delivery and my Department understands that a decision on the planning permission application is due shortly. When secured and when the accommodation is tendered, the school will then submit a tender report, with recommendation, to my Department for approval.

This included additional funding of &euro;75m which was allocated to cover an enhanced Minor Works Grant at primary level. The Minor Works grant allows schools to undertake improvement works in full or in part, as the grant allows, without prior application to my Department. A total of &euro;33,954 was paid to the school in question under the Minor Works Grant in 2020. It is open to the school to utilise this funding for maintenance work to the school&rsquo;s buildings.</p>  <p>  With regard to prefab rental, in 2007, my Department approved rental of a temporary classroom at a cost of &euro;14,102 per annum. Approval to rent an additional temporary classroom was granted in 2008 at an annual cost of &euro;15,254. The total grant paid to date for these rental arrangements amount to &euro;395,751.</p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department approved the purchase of an additional temporary classroom at a cost of &euro;92,007 and in 2017, a further grant of &euro;107,434 was approved for the purchase of an additional classroom.</p>  <p>   The site on which the school is located is owned by the school patron.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies, which have been approved by the patron and are now published on the schools website. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Nonetheless, where a school is oversubscribed some pupils may not obtain a place in the school.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies.  Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. My Department does not seek to intervene in the selection criterion that is applied by schools.</p></reply>

With regard to the additional post-primary services required as a result of the updated health advice received from NPHET on the 18th   August, which was that post-primary services are required to operate using 50 per cent of passenger capacity,  Bus &Eacute;ireann invited applications in late  August from operators who wished to be considered for the provision of the required additional post-primary services. Following evaluation of the applications received a panel has been formed from which services can be drawn down as required. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation is achieved as quickly as possible on all post-primary services. Based on the analysis conducted by Bus &Eacute;ireann , which were based on a full academic year , the estimated costs ranged between an estimated &euro;87m to &euro;135m taking into account a range of rates and a range of potential solutions from re-organising or upgrading  existing services to  the requirement to go to the market to source all additional vehicles required. </p></reply>

Schools have put significant measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and significant funding has been provided to support schools in this respect.  The evidence to date from a public health perspective is that schools are safe.  The approach to Covid-19 in schools is led by the advice and guidance of the HSE Public Health.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. </p></reply>

Subsequently the rate was increased to &euro;350 per week, which is broadly equivalent to the two-person household rate for the main social welfare payments.  In June changes were introduced to the rates structure to link it to prior earnings. This approach is sustainable and fair given the extended duration of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is a significant measure in alleviating the financial hardship of those at risk of poverty because of a loss of employment arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Research and data published by both the CSO and the ESRI have indicated that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been instrumental in alleviating the impact of Covid-19 related lay-offs on poverty.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is paid at 4 rates: &euro;203 where prior earnings were less than &euro;200 per week; &euro;250 where prior earnings are between &euro;200 and &euro;300; &euro;300 where prior earnings are between &euro;300 and &euro;400; and &euro;350 where prior earnings were &euro;400 or more. </p>  <p>  Prior earnings are determined with reference to Revenue returns of reckonable earnings or income in the relevant reference period divided by the associated number of paid PRSI contributions or weeks of employment. Social welfare payments are not taken into account as they do not fall to be considered as reckonable earnings or income. This is consistent with the approach taken in other social welfare schemes, such as Jobseekers Benefit and Illness Benefit, where the rate of payment is determined by reference to prior earnings.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 981,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community.  The scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues.  The Free Travel Scheme was also never intended to provide additional transport options to travel pass holders but to allow them access to existing services available from transport providers who participate in the scheme. </p>  <p>  One of the key aspects of the free travel scheme is that the service provided is via open, publicly available services.  Wheelchair accessible taxis are private hire vehicles and any decision to allow free travel pass holders to use their free travel passes on a category of private hire vehicles would lead to similar requests from other groups that provide private hire vehicles.  This would place significant extra costs and additional administrative complexities on the free travel scheme.  It would lead to a fundamental change to the nature of the Free Travel Scheme and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  The provision of accessible public transport in rural areas is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In this regard, my Department does provide an annual funding contribution of &euro;1.5 million from the Free Travel budget provision towards the Transport for Ireland Local Links Programme, which is administered by the National Transport Authority under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Programme provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.  The Programme aims to enhance and sustain nationwide accessibility through community based participation, particularly for those at risk of social exclusion.  Services provided include door to door services on certain routes.  </p>  <p>  Supports may also be available under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme to assist with necessary travel costs either on a once-off basis as an exceptional needs payment or as a supplement where there is an ongoing need.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  At the end of 2019, 141 persons were in receipt of a Travel Supplement. In addition, over 17,200 exceptional needs payments were made in 2019 to assist with travel costs, at a cost of almost &euro;1.2 million.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-15a.913.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121500071#WRQ05800"><p>Blind Pension (BP) is a means tested payment paid to blind people and certain people with low vision, aged 18 and up to the age of 66 who are habitually resident in the State. </p><p>BP is one of a range of means-tested social assistance payments. Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse / partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most.  Given this, changes to means assessments for schemes, including the Blind Pension, are considered within the overall budgetary context. </p><p>BP is designed to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their personal employment goals, be that self-employment or in insurable employment, in that the payment is structured whereby an earnings disregard and taper are applied.  Changes have also been introduced in line with the recommendations of the Make Work Pay (MWP) for people with disabilities report. For example, a &euro;20 increase in the Blind Pension earnings disregard was introduced in Budget 2021 - currently the first &euro;120 a week of earnings is disregarded in the means test, with a tapered reduction thereafter for earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350.This increase in the disregard from &euro;120 to &euro;140 will commence in June 2021.  Other changes introduced include the removal of the legislative requirement that work undertaken must be &lsquo;rehabilitative&rsquo; in nature, the introduction of an online &lsquo;ready reckoner&rsquo; (to assist people to calculate their financial position when taking up employment) and an increase in the medical card disregard to &euro;427 a week. </p><p>Resulting also from a measure in Budget 2021, the Training Support Grant (TSG) of up to &euro;1,000 is being expanded and it will be available through Employability services, which is a specialist employment service for Jobseekers with disabilities,  delivered on the Department's behalf.</p><p>It is important to note that, in addition to providing income supports, the Department provides a wide range of employment-related supports for both jobseekers with disabilities, including persons who are blind or have a visual impairment, and employers seeking to employ a jobseeker with a disability (or retain an existing employee who has or acquires a disability).  These supports for jobseekers with disabilities have been designed to enable persons with a disability to achieve their employment ambitions by focusing on the individual person&rsquo;s ability and capacity, rather than on the disability.  The pre-employment and in-employment supports available include:</p><p><i>DSP Intreo Service (the public employment service)</i></p><p>Jobseekers (including jobseekers with disabilities) who seek support from their local Intreo Centre, will have a meeting arranged with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available with a view to them achieving their employment ambitions.</p><p><i>Local Employment Service</i></p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of the Local Employment Service, which provides a local gateway, or access point, to the full range of services and facilities that are available to help jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, to enter or return to employment.</p><p><i>EmployAbility Service</i></p><p>The Department has contracts for the provision of the EmployAbility Service with 24 companies.  This is a specialist employment service designed to improve employment outcomes for jobseekers with a disability.  The service includes the provision of dedicated job coach support as well as both pre-employment and in employment support and assistance.</p><p><i>AHEAD (Support For Graduates With Disabilities)</i></p><p>The Department contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; programmes.  These programmes provide supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter the workforce.</p><p><i>Ability</i></p><p>The &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; programme is co-funded by the Irish Exchequer and the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme (PEIL, 2014 &ndash; 20).  Under this programme funding has been provided, through Pobal, for 27 organisations to support young people (aged 15-29) with disabilities in their transition into further education or employment.</p><p><i>Wage Subsidy Scheme</i></p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives (a wage subsidy). The subsidy is delivered in three strands:</p><p>- Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability. An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week. The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount of the  subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.</p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand  I  payment. Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs relating to these employees. This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I. It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability.</p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 30 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be  eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.</p><p><i>Reasonable Accommodation Fund</i></p><p>The Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) assists both jobseekers with disabilities and employers to enable a persons with disabilities to enter/re-enter or sustain employment by providing a range of grants.  In summary, the fund is comprised of the following four grants:</p><p><i>1. Personal Reader Grant</i></p><p>If a person is blind or visually impaired and needs assistance with job-related reading, s/he may be entitled to a grant to allow him/her to employ a Personal Reader. The amount of the grant payable is based on an hourly fee paid to the reader, in line with the current minimum wage, for an agreed period - for a maximum of 640 hours per year.</p><p><i>2. Employee Retention Grant</i></p><p>The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire a disability by providing funding to:<ul type="circle"><li>Identify accommodation and / or training to enable the employee to remain in his/hercurrent position; or</li><li>Re-train the employee so that s/he can take up another position within the company.</li></ul></p><p><i>3. Workplace Equipment / Adaptation Grant</i><br /><br />Where a person with a disability has been offered employment or is in employment, and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s/he or the employer may apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment. <br /><br /><i>4. Job Interview Interpreter Grant</i><br /><br />A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend the interview with him/her.  Funding can also be provided to cover the costs of an interpreter during an induction period when starting work.<br /><br /><i>Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme</i><br /><br />In addition to the RAF, the Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme (DASS) provides funding (a grant) for the provision of  Disability Awareness Training for a company's staff.  The purpose of the training is to deliver clear and accurate information about disability and to address questions or concerns that employers and employees may have about working with and supporting a colleague with disabilities.<br /><br />I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Last November, I secured Government approval to extend the 2020 earnings reference period for employees to September 2020.  This change, which is effective from 2 October, meant that people who only commenced employment after February 2020 but were laid-off in October due to increased restrictions can have their payment rate fixed by reference to their earnings in the period March to September 2020.  </p>  <p>  As a result of extending the reference period to the end of September 2020, some 37,430 receiving PUP on 17 November received an increase in their rate of payment. </p>  <p>  It is expected that a significant number of those who benefitted from the extended reference period will be due arrears, either to the 2 October or the date of commencement of their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, whichever is the later.</p>  <p>  During the month of November, a number of very significant IT changes were in progress in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. These included the finalisation of the general arrears project involving 286,000 additional payments on 1 December, payment of the Christmas Bonus on 8 December to just over 283,000 recipients of the PUP, and advance payments over the Christmas period. Against that background, and in order to ensure continuity of service delivery, it was not possible to introduce further changes to allow for processing of any re-rate arrears which may have arisen. </p>  <p>  Preparatory work is already under way to ensure payment of any of these arrears and it is expected that these will issue in early January.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought by CE supervisors, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing the CE Supervisors continue to engage in discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.</p></reply>

To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.

The Target is to reduce the share of the population in consistent poverty to 2% or less by the end of 2025. The latest data available for this measure is from the 2019 CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), and shows the consistent poverty rate in Ireland was 5.5%. This continues the downward trend in consistent poverty seen in recent years and is a significant decrease from a peak of 9.0% in 2013.</p>  <p>  The National Social Target for Poverty Reduction has two sub-targets.  The first is the child poverty target to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two thirds on the 2011 level (107,000 children). This would result in some 37,000 children or less in consistent poverty by the end of 2020. The 2019 SILC data shows the consistent poverty rate for children was 8.1%, which equates to approximately 97,000 children (using CSO estimated 2019 child population figures). Based on the most recently available data, it is clear that the child poverty target is unlikely to be met. However the work to reduce the number of children in poverty continues.  This is reflected in the targeted welfare measures included in Budget 2021 which saw increases in the weekly Qualified Child rates and the income thresholds for the Working Family Payment, along with increased investment in the Hot School Meals programme.  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion includes a commitment to continue to monitor progress against the child poverty target and to set a new target to the end of 2025.  </p>  <p>  The second sub-target relates to the requirement, under the Europe 2020 strategy, for EU member states to set a national poverty target which will contribute to meeting the EU poverty target: to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty or exclusion by 2020 (using 2008 as baseline year). Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of 'combined poverty' between 2010 and 2020. Based on the 2019 SILC data, approximately 177,000 have been lifted out of combined poverty.</p>  <p>  It should be noted for both the child poverty reduction target and Europe 2020 target, that the most recent data available is from 2019. Relevant 2020 data will not be available until late 2021, which will give a clearer final picture of progress towards both targets. </p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

It is a whole-of-government strategy with a five year timeframe and a mid-term review at the mid-point, in 2022.  This will facilitate an evaluation of the impact of the Roadmap commitments. The Roadmap will build on the work of its predecessors with the aim of reducing the number of people in consistent poverty in Ireland and increasing social inclusion for those who are most disadvantaged.  This is reflected in its clearly stated ambition to &ldquo;Reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less and to make Ireland one of the most socially inclusive countries in the EU&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The Roadmap translates this ambition into seven Goals underpinned by 66 unique Commitments (actions) that will be taken to help deliver these goals.  While the commitments and targets were agreed pre-Covid, the implementation of the Roadmap and delivery of the commitments remain of central importance.  The Programme for Government reaffirms the Government's commitment in this regard, noting that the Roadmap will be rigorously implemented.  I chaired the first meeting of the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group in November and I was pleased to see that progress is underway on the majority of the commitments, notwithstanding the additional challenges faced by all Government departments this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap is the successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and the Updated National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, which covered the period 2015-2017 and was developed to reflect the policy changes and new social and economic realities that emerged from the recession and ensuing recovery. During 2018 and 2019, my Department engaged in a public consultation process and engaged extensively with Government Departments to develop a robust, whole of government strategy with a focus on reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion for those who are most disadvantaged in our society.</p>  <p>  Together with the work undertaken by my Department, as reflected in the targeted measures contained in Budgets 2018, 2019 and 2020 and again in the recent Budget 2021,  work to address poverty and social exclusion also continued across Government to deliver actions under the range of sectoral plans that have social inclusion and poverty reduction as key objectives, in areas such as education, health, housing, equality, children,  integration and community development.  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion recognizes the strong role that sectoral plans play in reducing poverty and improving social inclusion and therefore does not seek to replicate them.  It does however set a level of ambition as to what is to be achieved which will inform and be reflected in sectoral and service plans across government as they are renewed and updated over the coming years.</p>  <p>   I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

By Q3 2020 these figures had increased to 20 percent and 25,000 respectively. Moreover, if we include PUP recipients in the figures, by the end of November, over 47 percent of young people in the labour force were unemployed, with one-in-four current PUP recipients (approx. 88,000) under the age of 25. However, these figures include young people in full time education who are in receipt of PUP, who would not normally be included in traditional measures of unemployment. </p><p>Experience from previous downturns has shown us that the impacts of labour market shocks can be weighted towards younger people. Much of this impact can be related to employers operating a &ldquo;last in, first out&rdquo; approach when enforcing cutbacks and reducing their workforce. Recent research by my Department has shown that young people make up a significant share of workers in those sectors most greatly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions; namely the hospitality and retail sectors.</p><p>While many young people, in particular those in receipt of PUP, will return to work as restrictions hopefully, continue to ease, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost. </p><p>This is why the European Commission believed it was important to reinforce the existing Youth Guarantee (YG) to aid in alleviating the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on young people accessing the labour market and in gaining jobs. </p><p>As Minister for Social Protection, and in light of the current challenges faced by the young people in the labour market, I welcome the Council of the European Union&rsquo;s recommendation on a reinforced Youth Guarantee.</p><p>Central to the reinforced programme is the extension of the widening of the youth age bracket to include young people aged 25-29. This change acknowledges changes ongoing in our society at present; including the fact that school-to-work transitions and sustainable labour market integration now take longer because of the changing nature of work, extended periods spent in education and the skills in demand. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have set plans in place to support and assist those, including young people, whose jobs are permanently lost due to Covid-19 and the impact of public health restrictions on the economy. These measures include;</p><p>- Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres during Q1 2020 with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Case officer support to help people with job search advice and assistance is shown to be the most effective means of helping people move into employment.</p><p>- Extending the current contracts of existing contracted public employment service providers into 2021. </p><p>- Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people.  Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).  This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face difficulties in securing a footing in employment. My Department will begin actively promoting this Scheme to employers early in the new year, and 8,000 places will be available for young jobseekers throughout 2021.</p><p>- Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited until June 2021. By end September, over 3,000 new apprenticeships with over 600 employers were registered.</p><p>- Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months. My Department will actively promote this scheme to suitable candidates. Additional provision has been made in Budget 2021 of &euro;3.5million &ndash; equivalent to an extra 700 places.</p><p>A core element of the reinforced Youth Guarantee is to support young people in gaining valuable work experience and developing the right skills for a changing world of work. Building on the success of the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS), my Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new work placement experience programme for those out of work for at least six months. This programme will seek to encourage employers to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.  It is intended that the programme will support mentoring to encourage jobseekers to expand their horizons and avail of new learning options which can help them to grow into a new career. There is a target of over 10,000 persons, regardless of age, to be placed on this six-month scheme by end 2021. </p><p>Work is also at an advanced stage by my Department to develop <i>Pathways to Work</i>, the national employment services strategy for the period 2021-2025. The strategy will seek to incorporate the core elements of the reinforced Youth Guarantee and build on the support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  Publication is expected in early 2021, following the launch of the Government's National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

It was also paid to people on equivalent jobseeker payments who have been in receipt of these payments for four months or more.  </p>  <p>  The reason Illness Benefit is not a qualifying payment for the Christmas Bonus is that, in the great majority of cases, Illness Benefit is a short-term payment for those who are  certified by their GP as needing to take time out from their employment due to illness. </p>  <p>  People who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for Invalidity Pension, subject to satisfying the relevant medical and social insurance contribution criteria.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;194 million in 2020.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carers Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  This will benefit over 130,000 carers. Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim will also benefit from the Budget 2021 announced increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse / civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees , is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The competitions were held for the South East, Midlands, Mid-West, South-West, Mid-East, West, Dublin and the Border Regions. </p>  <p>  All properties selected under the tender process must be able to meet the requirements of the National Standards for accommodation centres. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider.

This includes the other Government Departments and organisations that provide key services and supports to residents, like the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills, Health, the HSE and Tusla. </p>  <p>  While I can fully appreciate that community engagement as early as possible in the process is preferable, the Deputy will appreciate that this type of engagement is not possible prior to the commercially sensitive negotiations being concluded and the contract being signed with my Department as, until then, there is no guarantee that the negotiations will be successful or that a centre will actually open. </p></reply>

Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Gender Pay Gap Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. The Bill was published on 8 April 2019 and completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage in June 2019. It has since then been reintroduced by the Government, and Report Stage is currently awaited. Work is advancing on legislative amendments to be introduced during Report Stage.  It is hoped therefore that the Bill will be enacted in the very near future.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department have been in contact with EU counterparts to confirm this pledge and to begin the process of resettling refugees to Ireland. </p>  <p>  We await details from the European Commission of the family groups and unaccompanied minors and clarification regarding logistics for the interview missions required to transfer refugee families to Ireland. The necessary arrangements are in place to receive migrants who had been in Moria, however as yet the process which the Commission and Greek authorities are undertaking to identify those who will travel is ongoing and as such no migrants originating from the Moria camp have yet traveled to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Following the fires in Moria, unaccompanied minors who had been living in that camp were dispersed to other parts of Greece by the Greek authorities. The Greek State is now endeavouring to assess the total population of minors living in precarious conditions, estimated to be approximately 700 minors. In order to match an unaccompanied minor with an appropriate state for placement, the assessment will take into account the child&rsquo;s best interests, and each member state&rsquo;s commitment. Following the assessment, the Greek State will propose a consolidated list to the European Commission.</p>  <p>  I am working to accelerate the reception of the additional refugees which the Government has committed to taking in particular unaccompanied minors.  However, this will not occur until the Greek authorities have completed their assessment of the situation on the ground in Greece.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the ongoing process in identifying refugees from Moria, and in spite of obvious Covid-related challenges this year, Ireland has continued to accept refugees under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme in 2020, with 195 new arrivals originating from Syria. </p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;5 million in Budget 2021 to support the intake of unaccompanied minors from Greece under the International Protection Programme, and a number of options are being progressed by Tusla and my officials to expand the number of available care placements. These include the expansion of care placements, the development of specialised foster care placements, and provision of aftercare supports when children turn 18. The intention is that any rapid expansion does not negatively impact the quality of the service provided, and that Ireland&rsquo;s standard of treating unaccompanied minors as children first, and not only refugees or asylum seekers, is maintained.</p></reply>

The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper, which will set out options, together with the recommended direction, for the new model of accommodation and services for International Protection applicants and the transitional processes needed to implement the model.  Options for developing a not-for-profit approach are currently being examined in this regard. </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made on drafting the White Paper and work is now focusing on testing the accommodation proposals that will be contained in it. In view of the extent of change proposed, the White Paper will take some more time than originally envisaged and I now expect it will be published in the second week of February.</p>  <p>  I am providing a total of &euro;225 million in funding for International Protection Seekers Accommodation for the coming year in Budget 2021. The increased funding, &euro;145 million over what was provided in 2020, will enable my Department to begin the process of implementing the Programme for Government commitment to end the Direct Provision system and to plan for the transition to an alternative model of provision.  Funding issues across Government will be included in the final White Paper when completed.  </p></reply>

This extension will apply to parents who may have already availed of their existing entitlements. </p>  <p>  Heads of a Bill to effect these changes were approved by the Government this month and it is anticipated that legislation will be introduced in the New Year.</p>  <p>  Payment of Parents&rsquo; Benefit is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, and I understand that it will take time for the relevant IT system changes to be made.  As a result, the estimated timescale for the necessary updates being put in place is April 2021 .  </p>  <p>  However, I am examining whether it may be possible for Parents&rsquo; Leave to be taken in advance of these changes and the benefit claimed retrospectively, once the legislation has been enacted. I will take advice from Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that it is possible to draft the legislation in this way. I will ensure that parents are fully informed of their entitlements in this regard as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Myself, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have discussed this issue with the view to progressing it as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  As part of the same legislation, I will also be bringing proposals on adoptive leave. This will allow all adopting couples, whether same sex or opposite sex, to have the right to select which of them would be the qualified adopter for the purposes of taking adoptive leave and benefit.  This is an important provision which was committed to in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>   The proposed adoptive leave proposals will also enable married male same-sex adopting couples to be eligible for adoptive leave.  It will also enable all adopting couples &ndash; same-sex and opposite-sex &ndash; to be able to choose which of the couple should take the adoptive leave.  At the moment, adoptive leave is structured so that the adopting mother takes the leave.  The new provisions would enable either the adopting mother or the adopting father to be eligible to take adoptive leave once the choice has been made by the couple.</p></reply>

Notably, the legislation does not prescribe the methods to be employed by the Commission in notifying relevant persons.  This reflects the understanding that each person who attended the committee completed a form indicating the means by which they could be contacted, with many opting for mobile phone contact only, with no contact to be made by email or by post.  As such, the legislative approach respects the preferences indicated by those who attended the Confidential Committee.</p>  <p>  Many of the witnesses who described their personal experiences to the Confidential Committee did so in the legitimate expectation that their confidentiality would be protected. Others may wish to ensure their name is attached to their story. Most importantly, the amendment made to the records legislation following the Seanad debate protects the agency of each person who provided a personal story to the Confidential Committee to decide if they want their name included in the records which the Commission must transfer to the Department. Any person who wishes to have their name redacted must tell the Commission this in writing.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this process only applies to material provided to the Confidential Committee. As such, it relates only to the stories which people voluntarily came forward to tell with the understanding that they were doing so in a 'safe and uncontested space' where they would remain anonymous. It does not relate to any broader evidence or documents, eg. Institutional records or evidence given under oath. </p>  <p>  In terms of what personal identifying information stands to be redacted, the Commission has confirmed that, as per the leaflets prepared for the Confidential Committee, the typed record of the story recounted by the individual is created in a manner which, at the outset, does not contain identifying information either in relation to the person who came forward to tell the story or in relation to any other person.  As such, the only identifying information is the name and contact details of the individual which are attached/ indexed to the story.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Commission is making initial contacts with relevant persons by telephone but it is important to clarify that I have no role in the arrangements by which the independent Commission is contacting witnesses.</p></reply>

Many of the stakeholders I have engaged with in recent weeks have highlighted these issues to me, and I recognise the importance of ensuring former residents&rsquo; mental health is prioritised and supported.</p>  <p>  Additional funding resources have been made available by the Health Service Executive in 2020 to put in place dedicated and enhanced counselling and separate patient advocacy services for former residents of these institutions. I am continuing to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health, to ensure that available capacity is used to the best effect in delivering a strong, responsive and timely service for survivors. </p>  <p>  In relation to counselling, the National Counselling Service is a specialist service with 20 years of experience in providing counselling and psychotherapy to a wide range of clients including those who have experienced psychological difficulties due to time spent in institutions. Counselling is available face to face, by telephone or online through secure video. Access to the National Counselling Service for former residents may be made by direct self-referral or by written referrals from health care professionals, such as GPs. </p>  <p>  In addition, an out of hours service, Connect Counselling, is also available to provide support and is currently providing an enhanced service from 6pm to 10pm every day (7 days a week). This service is staffed by a professional team experienced in the work of past trauma and in particular childhood trauma. A new webpage with all relevant information for former residents of Mother and Baby Homes has been set-up by the HSE. </p>  <p>  An information line has also been established in my Department and all relevant contact information for these supports is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Publication of the report, when it occurs, may be a difficult time for all of those affected.

The purpose or target of the funding is determined on an annual basis having regard to the needs of children, families and service providers, and Departmental priorities.  A total of &euro;8.3million is available in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, a key objective of the funding has been to extend capacity, but in 2021, my Department is responding to a different need.  As the Deputy points out, services are required to provide Fire Safety Certificates as part of the re-registration process.  Many services have already re-registered and submitted a fire safety certificate and some have re-registered subject to submitting an up to date Fire Safety Certificate in 2021.  Some services may need to carry out remedial works to receive a Fire Safety Certificate, but the costs for this can be prohibitive, especially in the current extenuating circumstances of COVID.   </p>  <p>  Given that my absolute priority to keep children safe, I have decided that the first call on the 2021 capital funding will be given to ensuring fire safety in early learning and childcare services around the country.   With this in mind, my Department will offer a Fire Safety Capital Grant through Pobal in early 2021 to contribute towards the costs of required remedial works. Only expenditure from 01 January 2021 to 30 November 2021 will be eligible. Pobal will provide further details to providers shortly. </p>  <p>  If any of the &euro;8.3million available is not required for this purpose, my Department will distribute the balance by way of a second round of grants, which will focus on outdoor play.  Further detail on this will be announced in early April 2021. </p></reply>

It is a rolling programme, meaning that it is available all year-round and that parents can apply for the Scheme when most convenient for them.</p>  <p>  As stated in the NCS Application Renewal Guide provided by the Deputy, parents are given six weeks&rsquo; notice to renew their NCS subsidy award. Parents receive an email directing them to the NCS Portal where they are informed of the approaching end date for their award and that they need to take action to renew their award. There is a six week window in which they can do this. Parents are also sent a second notification two weeks before their award is due to expire.</p>  <p>  Parents who previously applied offline using a paper application form do have the option to renew online by logging into the NCS Portal, through the NCS website and MyGovID. This will result in a faster renewal process. Alternatively, they can complete their renewal offline, and should call the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530 to arrange this.</p>  <p>  A parent who reapplies and selects to have their income assessed through the Fast Track route will have their assessment completed within 48 hours.</p>  <p>  Where a parent does not take action within the six week renewal period to renew their award until the award expires, there may be gaps in the payment of their subsidy as a result, particularly if they apply for an income-assessed award or if further documentation is required as part of the assessment process. NCS subsidies can only be paid once a valid CHICK has been registered by a childcare provider and the parent has confirmed on the system that all details are correct.</p></reply>

This includes circa &euro;400m on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 74,000 further and higher education students.</p><p>To give an overview of some of the main additional measure put in place:  </p><p>- I have doubled the level of funding available in the Student Assistance Fund for this academic year;</p><p>- I have increased the level of funding for the 1916 Bursary Fund (also known as PATH 2) to &euro;5 million per annum, which will provide an additional 200 bursaries, bringing the total number for 2021 to 1,000 bursaries for the most disadvantaged students in the country; </p><p>- I have secured an additional &euro;20 million in funding for SUSI next year to cover increased applications to the scheme;</p><p>- I have allocated &euro;6 million to enhance SUSI support for postgraduates;</p><p>- I put in place a &euro;15 million scheme to support access to laptops and digital devices;</p><p>- I have secured &euro;50 million to provide financial assistance to full time third level students inrecognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this group; and</p><p>- I have also allocated &euro;3m for wellbeing and mental health. </p><p>All students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the <b>Student Assistance Fund, </b>which assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. Eligible costs include books and other class material that are required to enable students to continue and participate in teaching and learning, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills such as mobile phone data plans, food, essential travel, childcare costs, medical costs and family difficulties. The SAF allocation is &euro;18.2 million for 2020/21, a record increase on previous years. This includes the once off exceptional &euro;8.1 million to help deal with the Covid-19 effect on students in the financial year 2020. In 2019 the allocation for SAF was &euro;10.1m and supported circa 14,000 students. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility Student in the Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, <b>tax relief</b>at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. Within this package, additional funding provided for student supports will be of assistance to many students particularly those with the least financial resources. </p><p>This package of Covid 19 supports includes a further &euro;10m in access supports for students. Most of this money will be used to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF), with remaining funding of &euro;1.9m going towards a once-off contingency fund of to support the delivery of access and support services to vulnerable students from target groups. </p><p>The &euro;1.9m COVID19 Contingency fund for Access and Support Services will assist access offices in HEIs to implement supports to meet the needs of particularly vulnerable students, with priority given to National Access Plan Target groups, who have been most impacted by Covid-19.This includes: entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; Irish Travellers; first time-mature student entrants; students with disabilities; part-time/flexible learners and further education award holders entrants, lone parents and ethnic minorities. Further details about access supports for vulnerable students can be obtained from the access office of the institution attended</p></reply>

TUs will bring significant benefits in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression.</p>  <p>  The establishment of other TUs in addition to the current TU Dublin and Munster Technological University, in the Midlands / Midwest, North / North West and the South East over the next number of years, in fulfilment of commitments in the Programme for Government, will ensure an equitable regional distribution of this new type of higher education institution.  </p>  <p>  Arising directly from the 2019 TURN high level group report, which sets out the blueprint for successful TUs and their development in the State, Budget 2020 introduced a new TU transformation fund of &euro;90 million going out to 2023. This represents a trebling of annual funding and will see TU-oriented funding increase to over &euro;120 million by 2023. The fund will assist in key investment areas including digital infrastructure, research capacity building, change management, systems integration, governance and project management structures and information sharing to establish TUs and assist them to deliver key strategic social and economic development objectives and to respond to specific diverse regional and sectoral impacts such as Brexit.</p>  <p>  On 7 October, I announced a total of &euro;34.3 million in funding allocations under the Fund. The allocations will be disbursed in two tranches in quarter 4 this year and quarter 1 next year. Further allocations will be made in 2021 and 2022 with an emphasis from next year onwards on assisting inter-TU and consortia collaboration on systemic projects as TUs bed down and start to operate within their new environments, in pursuance of their missions and functions in the crucial formative years. </p>  <p>  In tandem, the Department is working with sectoral stakeholders and with other Government Departments to establish the mechanisms through which TUs can become more financially independent as elaborated in the 2019 TURN report.  This includes the development of a borrowing framework which will enable TUs to access non-Exchequer funding such as the European Investment Bank provides and put them on an equal footing with the traditional universities. </p>  <p>  Other relevant TURN report recommendations relate to enabling TUs to build their research capacity in both applied and theoretical fields and to attract both increased research funding and to retain and attract high calibre research staff. This would involve the reconfiguration of the financing models currently in place in the publicly funded higher education sector. </p>  <p>The TURN report also recommends there should be a prioritisation of capital investment in TUs in the allocation of capital funding resources to the higher education in prescribed circumstances. Currently eleven building projects in the technological sector are being advanced as part of the Higher Education PPP Programme.  The projects are particularly urgent for delivery given their role in enabling projected increases in student enrolments, addressing severe constraints with regard to existing infrastructure and advancing the TU agenda.  The programme will deliver some 70,000m2   of additional space, generating an additional 8,000 student places, mainly in STEM-related areas.   </p>  <p>  Government funding is allocated or distributed to higher education institutions by the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In 2016, the HEA appointed an independent Expert Panel to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future. The review involved research and analysis and extensive consultation with stakeholders and examined, inter alia, key issues and questions, the cost drivers and the costing system underpinning higher education and international funding allocation approaches. The review report recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model (RFAM).  It also highlights the importance of innovation, research and performance measures in the higher education sector. The review of the funding model provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed model that is consistent across all higher education institutions - Institutes of Technology, traditional universities and TUs &ndash; and that is more transparent, that incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as research and STEM provision and that supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy. This will ensure that the additional funding available for higher education is targeted effectively and that institutions are held accountable for how they use public resources. Phased implementation of the report recommendations commenced in 2019 and by end 2020 over &euro;75 million of additional funding measures will have been allocated. In 2020, an additional &euro;1.2 million is allocated to the HEA to continue implementation of the report recommendations.  A key recommendation is the development of a Universal Funding Model applied consistently across higher education institutes with consultants Deloitte being appointed by HEA in 2019 to undertake a scoping exercise on an appropriate model.  The HEA working with the Department, the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform, the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association will commence development of a conceptual framework towards adoption of a Common Full Economic Costing System applying across the entire higher education sector.  This will be an important milestone to help underpin a new strategic funding policy for the sector.</p></reply>

While the introduction of strict public health restrictions impacted widely on postgraduate students, the shift to online learning necessitated by Covid impacted predominantly on taught postgraduate programmes. </p>  <p>  While Ireland was on Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions delivered the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this was disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  As we have now moved to Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID, there is a shared ambition between my Department and the sector to increase face to face learning on a phased and incremental basis for priority groups. While large-scale learning, such as lectures will remain online for the rest of the year, it is intended that priority groups identified by institutions will be invited in for more on campus activities.</p>  <p>  It is also hoped that it will be possible to restart social activities such as sports, clubs and societies to allow students to experience these elements of college life again.</p>  <p>  It is important to be realistic and to continue to respond to public health advice.  The scope for onsite activities will continue to be shaped by the prevailing public health circumstances.</p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous institutions as provided for in legislation. The determination, as to the total level of postgraduate fees to be charged, is a matter for each institution in accordance with its own particular operational conditions and circumstances in ensuring quality education provision. The actual cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic indeed institutions have had a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes despite the unique circumstances of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p>  <p>  The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic will offer &euro;250 in financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions.</p>  <p>  This builds on the previously enhanced student supports provided in response to COVID-19, including the  doubling of the Student Assistance Fund and the provision of &euro;15m in funding for laptops and devices. </p></reply>

Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities.  A <b><i>Progress Review of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Priorities to 2021</i></b>was published in December 2018.

The target of 8% that was set for the lifetime of the Plan has been exceeded by the Progress Review stage with a new target of 12% set for 2021.  Overall participation rate has increased to 10.5%, and targets have equally been surpassed in respect of the three categories of disability.

This was established to meet an identified need for applicants who choose to engage the assistance of their public representatives in making enquiries about their grant applications.</p><p>This service, which was set up at the behest of Oireachtas members, complements the established channels provided by SUSI which include online application tracking, a dedicated website, a telephone helpdesk, email and social media, including Facebook and Twitter. Enquiries may be emailed direct to SUSI at oireachtas@susi.ie. Staff in SUSI are responding to email queries within a matter of days.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant. However, in general terms, the qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant is as follows: </p><p>(i) The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant (i.e. the 100% grant); </p><p>(ii) Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500; and</p><p>(iii) As at 31st December 2019, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme.  <b></b></p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant was increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 Scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).  <b></b></p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie. </p><p>All students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the <b>Student Assistance Fund, </b>which assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. Eligible costs include books and other class material that are required to enable students to continue and participate in teaching and learning, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills such as mobile phone data plans, food, essential travel, childcare costs, medical costs and family difficulties. The SAF allocation is &euro;18.2 million for 2020/21, a record increase on previous years. This includes the once off exceptional &euro;8.1 million to help deal with the Covid-19 effect on students in the financial year 2020. In 2019 the allocation for SAF was &euro;10.1m and supported circa 14,000 students. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility Student in the Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 pandemic. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, <b>tax relief</b>at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  While Ireland was on Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions delivered the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this was disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  As we have now moved to Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID, there is a shared ambition between my Department and the sector to increase face to face learning on a phased and incremental basis for priority groups. While large-scale learning, such as lectures will remain online for the rest of the year, it is intended that priority groups identified by institutions will be invited in for more on campus activities.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p>  <p>  The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.  </p></reply>

While I appreciate that this was disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  As we have now moved to Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID, there is a shared ambition between my Department and the sector to increase face to face learning on a phased and incremental basis for priority groups, such as first years. While large-scale learning, such as lectures will remain online for the rest of the year, it is intended that priority groups identified by institutions will be invited in for more on campus activities.</p>  <p>  Recently, I launched a new National Framework to address the issues of student mental health and suicide prevention. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework has been developed as part of the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s commitment to play its part in delivering on the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020.</p>  <p>  The Framework was developed in collaboration with students, mental health and suicide prevention specialists, academics, researchers and institutional staff. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I also secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and re-opening of our higher education institutions. This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework.</p>  <p>  Following on from publication of the Framework, the HEA contacted institutions to progress its implementation and to follow up on the earlier funding allocations. Many institutions are already in process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, we're expecting many more to follow suit over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The HEA has outlined that the funding allocation for counselling services specifically is data driven, taking cognisance of research reports such as the USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the My World 2 report, the AHEAD &ldquo;Learning from Home&rdquo; report, and also reflecting USI&rsquo;s prioritisation of increasing capacity of counselling services and the finally promoting the implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework.</p>  <p>  In that way, the funding is intended to have a direct and immediate impact for students in this academic year, and the HEA will be requesting a further more detailed report at the end of the academic year which should clearly indicate the metrics used by institutions to measure impact and demonstrate outcomes including in respect of the capacity of counselling services offered by third-level institutions.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling in this current year will allow for development of active outreach to students and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.  </p>  <p>  In October, I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students, Text TCD to 50808. Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required.</p></reply>

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.</p>  <p>  Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses (including medicine courses). In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment.</p>  <p>  As the deputy is aware, Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. </p>  <p>  However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student (2019/20 academic year) with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p></reply>

To be eligible for grant assistance, students must be attending an approved full-time course at an approved institution. The Regulations prescribe that an approved course is a full-time course leading to a major higher education and training award which takes a minimum of two years to complete in an approved institution. </p>  <p>  Courses that are part-time or that are less than two years in duration or leading to a special purpose/minor award rather than a major award are not approved for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme. Distance Learning Courses are regarded as part-time courses and, as such, do not qualify for grant assistance under the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  Under Article 15(1) of the Student Grant Scheme, a grant can only be awarded for the normal duration of an approved course, and cannot be paid for any period of study that extends the normal course duration. </p>  <p>  However, I do think it is important to look more widely and how we can facilitate learners in different circumstances.  That is why I have announced a review of SUSI to guide the future strategic direction of the scheme. The review will commence in 2021. This review will include a focus on examining the future role of the student grant system in supporting different forms of provision in line with national priorities, including part-time provision. </p>  <p>  In terms of policy, planning for models of blended learning is taking place against a backdrop of an evolving public health environment. Changes to courses normally delivered on campus are in response to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic and are a temporary, evolving situation. </p>  <p>   In terms of supports for students with disabilities each HEI has an access and disability service in place to support students with disabilities. Students who feel that they may require supports from their institution should contact the access or disability service who will carry out a needs assessment in collaboration with the student. These supports will continue to be provided, as appropriate, where any online or blended learning takes place. </p>  <p>   The Fund Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. This supports the overall goals of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. In 2019 funding of &euro;9.6m was allocated to the FSD (covering both the higher education and further education sectors as well as Irish students studying in the UK and EU). The type of supports covered include:</p>  <p>  -  Assistive technology;</p>  <p>  -  Non-medical helpers;</p>  <p>  -  Academic/learning support;</p>  <p>  -  Deaf supports;</p>  <p>  -  Transport supports.</p>  <p>   Further Education and Training (FET) Institutions are planning a phased reopening for learners by 29 September and will aim to maximize learner onsite experience and endeavour to provide maximum possible face to face interaction taking into consideration all the risk factors and the requirements of the high-risk learner groups. Learning experience will be enhanced through onsite streaming facilities and blended learning.</p>  <p>   The Once-Off COVID-19 Grant (&euro;15m) to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices is part of the package of COVID-19 supports for higher and further education institutions funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The devices will be distributed by the relevant Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) via appropriate lending schemes.  The education institutions are best placed to determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In determining distribution of the devices, HEIs are required to have regard to the target groups, including students with disabilities, identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021. </p>  <p>  HEIs and ETBs must be satisfied that students who receive a device under this grant have demonstrated a verifiable need for such a device e.g. they or their family do not have the means to purchase such a device themselves. Students should contact their HEI access office for further information.</p>  <p>  Also tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

There are currently 59 apprenticeships available, the majority of which deliver off-the-job elements through higher education settings.  The 25 craft apprenticeships entail one period of off-the-job training in a Training Centre and two periods of off-the-job training in an Institute of Technology/Technological University.</p>  <p>  The impact of COVID-19 measures on businesses has resulted in a decrease of approximately 18% in new apprentice registrations for the year to end November (from 5,812 in 2019 to 4,792 in 2020).  </p>  <p>  The Government funded the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme (AIS) under the July Stimulus Package.  It has supported a significant recovery in registration numbers from a monthly low of 77 in April to 918 in October and 840 in November, exceeding registrations for the same time period last year.  The AIS  provides for an employer grant of &euro;3,000 which is paid over two years for each new apprentice recruited between 1st March 2020 and 30th June 2021.</p>  <p>  It is expected that new apprentice registrations will now surpass 5,000 for the year, in the region of 4,000 of which will be eligible for the incentive payment.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government committed to growing the number of apprenticeships significantly between now and 2025, increasing the total number of new registrations to at least 10,000 per annum. As part of this commitment, the new Action Plan for Apprenticeship, covering the next 5 year period, is nearing finalisation and will look at new ways of structuring, funding and promoting apprenticeships. </p></reply>

In this jurisdiction the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, under the command of the Assistant Commissioner for Organised and Serious Crime, holds a national investigative remit and is specialised in the area of major crime investigation.  It undertakes and supports investigations on the direction of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The support provided includes where appropriate deploying the expertise of the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT), which was established in 2007 to provide for independent review of historical investigations, including homicides. The purpose of a review conducted by the SCRT is to assist the Senior Investigating Officer with the criminal investigation. These reviews constitute an independent examination of evidence and other material, gathered during investigation and to ensure that it conforms to approved standards; that the investigation has been thorough, conducted with integrity and objectivity; and to identify further investigative opportunities. The remit of the SCRT is broad and would include reviews of troubles-related cases, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I am assured that in circumstances where historic offences have not been resolved, the investigations remain open and the Garda Authorities will and do follow up fully on any new evidence or information that becomes available to them, whether that comes from the public, from other police services or from their own investigations.</p></reply>

I have no role or function in the processing or management of complaints which are made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) for investigation.</p>  <p>  GSOC's main area of responsibility is to deal with complaints concerning Garda conduct. While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, provides for time limits for the making of complaints, such time limits may be extended where there is good reason. It is also the case that GSOC may investigate matters in relation to the conduct of Garda&iacute;, when it is in the public interest.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is nothing therefore to prohibit GSOC engaging with legacy cases where appropriate to do so.</p>  <p>  The organisation of the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is a matter for the Commission.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is a difficult and complex task. The Stormont House Agreement sets out a comprehensive set of measures to deal with legacy issues in a way that can meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors and support closure and reconciliation for those communities most affected by the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the implementation of those measures and we will continue to work with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give effect to them.</p></reply>

By their nature, many of these recommendations apply only to that jurisdiction and are recommendations to the UK Government.</p>  <p>  The Deputy draws particular attention to Recommendation 12 and 47. Recommendation 12 concerns access to justice to allow all conflict-related deaths to be fully investigated regardless of where a death happened, and Recommendation 47 concerns support for victims and survivors.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that successive Irish governments have consistently recognised and acknowledged the enduring suffering and hardship of victims of the conflict. The support for victims, both in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, is at the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to address the legacy of the troubles through the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>   A Remembrance Commission was established by the Irish Government in 2003 to administer a Scheme of assistance and remembrance for victims of the Northern Ireland conflict, and their families, in this jurisdiction. In so doing, the State formally recognised the needs of victims and survivors of the Northern Ireland conflict and their families. The State continues to support victims of troubles here with their ongoing medical costs via a scheme operated by the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>  On the issue of troubles related investigations, the Deputy can be assured that in circumstances where historic, troubles-related offences have not been resolved, the investigations remain open and the Garda Authorities will and do follow up fully on any new evidence or information that becomes available to them, whether that comes from the public, from other police services or from their own investigations.</p>  <p>  With regard to investigations, Commissions or Tribunals of Inquiry in relation to a historic crime with a cross&ndash;border element, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 as amended provides that assistance in relation criminal investigations or proceedings may be sought by one State from another, including cross-border investigations. The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 2019 provides that Coroners in Northern Ireland and Britain dealing with legacy cases can access testimony from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where this is relevant to their inquests.</p></reply>

These are an application for naturalisation on the basis of Irish descent or association, and an application for a Stamp 0.</p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p><p>It is open to an applicant to apply under Section 16(a) of the 1956 Act where the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish association. Under the legislation, a person is of Irish association if they are related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person (living or deceased) who is or was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen.  A civil partner of such a person may also qualify.</p><p>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended gives the Minister the absolute discretion to waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.</p><p>An application under Section 16 should be supported by substantive documentation supporting the claim, which renders the application exceptional and one where the normal pathways to citizenship provided for under the legislation are not appropriate. Applicants are also expected to have a reasonable period of lawful residence in the State, generally around 3 years, to show they have some substantial and tangible connection with Irish society and the State.</p><p>The alternative route to residency in the State for persons of Irish descent wishing to retire is to make an application for a Stamp 0 as an Elderly Dependent or as a Person of Independent Means.</p><p>Non-visa required nationals can submit their Stamp 0 application from inside or outside of the State. Visa required nationals must submit the application from outside of the State. Once the application is approved, they then apply for a Long Stay D visa to enter the State.</p><p>Both visa and non-visa required nationals are required to register with their local immigration office within 90 days of arrival in the State, following the grant of the immigration permission/entry to the State. Permission to remain is granted in one-year blocks. It may be renewed provided that the holder continues to satisfy the criteria upon which the permission was originally granted.</p><p>Further information on the application process and criteria for Stamp 0 can be found on the Immigration Service website at: .</p></reply>

The Information on Garda members may be accessed at the following link: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Garda_Workforce.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  The significant level of funding provided over recent years is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, there are now some 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide. Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to<b></b>620 new Garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff<b>.</b>The Budget allocation also provides for an increase in supervisory ranks at Sergeant and Inspector level.</p><p>More Garda recruits and more Garda staff means extra members of the service on the frontline and in specialist units battling organised crime groups, supporting victims, and keeping people safe.</p></reply>

The capacity of the District courtroom is 15 and the Circuit courtroom is 19. A jury trial requires a courtroom that would have a capacity of at least 25 persons including the judge, registrar, solicitors, barristers, accused, alleged injured party, garda&iacute;, family of accused and alleged injured party, members of the press and a jury of 12. The courthouse would also require a room to accommodate a socially distanced jury for deliberations. In many courthouses, courtrooms are used for this purpose. </p>  <p>  Alternative arrangements were made to facilitate jury trials on the South Western Circuit in Limerick Courthouse Mulgrave Street, with Kerry Circuit Court sitting in Limerick from the beginning of December for 3 weeks.  23 trials were listed for hearing during that period.

I know that he has campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the families for many years and, of course,  I am in full agreement with him that the perpetrators of this atrocity should be brought to justice.</p>  <p>  The bombing of Belturbet on 28 December 1972 was an appalling and callous act of violence that claimed the lives of two innocent young people and injured others. The pain and anguish caused was very evident in the RTE Investigates programme last night as family members recalled the events that took their loved ones away.  </p>  <p>  The dreadful effects of this attack last to this day; the suffering of those who have lost what was most precious to them goes on. That the perpetrators of this atrocity have never been held accountable for their crimes can only compound the sense of loss. </p>  <p>  My deepest sympathies go out to the bereaved and injured and it is my firm desire that the perpetrators will face justice and the families find the answers they seek.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Authorities have previously advised that the bombing and the murders were comprehensively investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time. The Defence Forces provided expert assistance and the investigation involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland. Despite every avenue of enquiry being pursued at the time there was insufficient evidence to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. </p>  <p>  The investigation into the bombing and the two murders has not been closed and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will pursue any new evidence or information that is made available. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would, of course, work in close co-operation with the PSNI where that could advance the investigation.</p>  <p>  Following the Debate in the House in September, I arranged for a copy of the academic article referred to by Deputy Smith, which concerned inter alia the Belturbet Bombing and information on a potential suspect, to be forwarded to the Garda authorities for attention. </p>  <p>  I have also requested an update from the Garda authorities on the investigation. </p>  <p>  Most importantly, I appeal for anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case, even after nearly 50 years, to bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities to aid their investigation. </p></reply>

Staff in these organisations are not public servants and were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation.  They did not automatically receive the cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants.  These employees differ to those employed by organisations who provide services under section 38 of the Act who are public servants and are therefore paid in line with the Department of Health consolidated salary scales. </p>  <p>  As we are aware, an agreement was reached by the parties in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by the 50 pilot agencies.  The purpose of pay restoration is to restore pay levels to what they were before these pay cuts were made.  Pay restoration commenced in April 2019 with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000.  Any outstanding balance would be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021, if due.</p>  <p>  This process will result in approximately half of the eligible section 39 employees having their pay fully restored by 2021.  There are 250 bodies who were not part of the pilot.  The agreement reached at the WRC noted that some of the organisations which did not form part of the pilot phase are also likely to have pay restoration issues.  It stated that a process of engagement to address this would commence in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Since late 2019, there was a number of meetings between the parties at the WRC, in relation to this next phase.  The HSE have been costing this next phase of pay restoration and engagement has been taking place with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding a proposal to resolve these pay restoration issues.  In this regard, funding was allocated in Budget 2021 for pay restoration for the 250 organisations.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that following engagement at the Workplace Relations Commission last week, the parties reached an agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021.  </p></reply>

Additionally, since December 2014 an EU regulation requires that beverages containing a proportion in excess of 150mg/l of caffeine are labelled with the statement &ldquo;High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women&rdquo; placed near the name of the product and followed by the caffeine content specified in mg per 100ml.</p><p>The Department of Health's national Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), published in 2016 recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed and implemented. The Voluntary Codes of Practice for the Non-Broadcast Media Advertising and Marketing of Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages, including Sponsorship and Retail Product Placement were launched in February 2018. The purpose of these Codes is to ensure that foods and drinks high in fat, especially saturated fat, sugar and salt are marketed and advertised in a responsible way, especially to young people. High energy drinks qualify as high sugar products under the criteria being used to define high sugar drinks. Therefore, their advertising, marketing, sponsorship and product placement is covered by these Codes.  They are also liable to the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax, which commenced on 1May 2018.</p></reply>

Health insurance providers operate in a competitive market and are free to impose certain terms and conditions in their policies, providing they comply with the overall governing legislation and broader regulatory requirements. The Health Insurance Acts do not impose obligations regarding the minimum or maximum time that receipts may be claimed by an insurance customer, such matters are usually determined by the contract between the insurer and the customer.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where queries regarding the terms and conditions of a policy arise, I would encourage health insurance customers to attempt to resolve complaints with their insurance provider in the first instance. If the insurance provider has not resolved the issue to the customers satisfaction, they can also refer the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FPSO). The FPSO is an independent officer who investigates complaints of customers about financial services. </p></reply>

The first of these was launched by An Taoiseach in April 2020. The #InThisTogether campaign offered advice, support and information around a range of themes, which included being active, eating well, coping at home, cocooning, the leaving cert and looking after your mental health, as well as signposting to other relevant and useful resources. The campaign encouraged people to make small simple changes to their everyday lives, such as eating a more balanced diet, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, drinking more water and watching portion sizes. It also advised people on the benefits of daily exercise, particularly outdoor exercise and the positive effects of that on physical and mental wellbeing. The #InThisTogether campaign was delivered across social media, radio, and digital and involved a wide range of partner and stakeholder collaboration, including Sport Ireland, Safefood, Local Authorities, Libraries, HSE, and other Government Departments. This campaign ran until mid-June. </p>  <p>  Following on from this campaign, a second campaign was launched by An Taoiseach in October 2020, aligned with the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with COVID-19.  The #KeepWell campaign is aimed at promoting resilience and positive physical and mental health and wellbeing. This campaign is organised under five themes; Keeping Active, Eating Well, Staying connected, Switching off and Being Creative, and Minding your Mood. This campaign is being delivered via social media, TV, Radio, print and digital and will run to spring 2021. This campaign again involves the collaboration of many stakeholders and partners, with an emphasis placed on local initiatives and resources. Sl&aacute;intecare has provided &euro;7m to support the delivery of initiatives and services with a range of partners including the Local Authorities, CYPSC, Sport Ireland, the HSE, Creative Ireland, Libraries Ireland and Bord Bia. More information on the campaign can be found at gov.ie/healthyireland. </p>  <p>  I have also asked the HSE to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent&reg;):</p>  <p>  -  For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  -  For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for pricing/reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing/reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019.  Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.  The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the process is still ongoing and that the matter will be included on the agenda for the HSE Drugs Group&rsquo;s meeting in January 2021.  The HSE further advises that a Drugs Group meeting did take place in December 2020 however it was not possible to discuss Dupilumab due to time constraints.</p>  <p>  The HSE Executive Management Team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and will, on receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Dupilumab will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

The NPHET reviews international developments as a component of their overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the Covid-19 and are informed by the international scientific evidence, and guidance by international bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).  WHO and ECDC guidance is formulated in the context of considered appraisal of the international experience and accumulating scientific evidence in relation to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The aim of face coverings is to reduce the spread of infection by acting as a source control to stop the spread of infection by the person wearing the mask (including those who do not know they are infected, such as those with no symptoms) or to protect the wearer from droplet splashes or inhaling airborne contaminants including small (aerosol) and large particle droplets. </p>  <p>  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the advice we are giving is that the use of face masks by persons going out in public has been recommended by an increasing number of countries.  In Ireland, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible, in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation.  Face coverings are also mandatory on public transport, including in taxis, as well as in bus and rail stations and in shops and other retail outlets.  In restaurants, you should wear a face covering on your way to and from your table.</p>  <p>  In both the primary and post-primary setting, it is a requirement that staff wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained.  Children in the post-primary setting should also wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained.  It is not recommended that children attending primary school wear face-coverings.  The requirements in relation to use of face coverings in schools are clearly outlined in the sectoral guidance available on the &lsquo;Back to School&rsquo; webpage at gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The WHO in their Guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 advise that the general public should be encouraged to use medical and non-medical masks in public settings, including schools. This advice can be found at  www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>  <p>  The ECDC advise that &ldquo;in secondary schools, the use of face masks is recommended for both students and adults&rdquo; and that &ldquo;The use of masks should be seen as a complementary measure, rather than a single measure to prevent transmission within schools&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has also issued guidance on use of face-coverings in childcare and educational settings to provide advice for staff and children, which is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/532b6-health-advice-provided-by-the-health-protection-surveillance-centre-hpsc-for-the-safe-reopening-of-schools-and-educational-facilities/ </p>  <p>  I would also direct you to the HPSC recommendations for sports activities for children and adolescents which is available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/sportandrecreation/COVID%2019%20Recommendations%20for%20Sports%20for%20children.pdf.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that face coverings complement other non-pharmaceutical intervention such as social distancing, hand washing, respiratory/cough etiquette, reducing number of contacts, in reducing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p></reply>

This new guidance outlines an updated definition for &lsquo;critical and compassionate circumstances&rsquo;, which now provides that residents may be facilitated to receive:</p>  <p>  -  up to one visit by one person per week under Levels 3 and 4 of the framework of restrictive measures; </p>  <p>  -  up to one visit per two weeks under Level 5;</p>  <p>  It also notes that at all levels of the framework for restrictive measures in the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, every practical effort should be made to accommodate an additional visit on compassionate grounds during the period of major cultural or religious festivals or celebrations of particular significance to the resident, such as the Christmas/New Year period.</p>  <p>  An external visit to a private home over Christmas will usually mean meeting quite a few people and it won't be possible to be sure that everyone who comes to the house has been checked for COVID-19 symptoms and is careful about social distancing.  As such, there may be significant risk of the unwitting introduction of COVID-19 into nursing homes associated with such external visits, particularly as there may be increased spread of infection in the community at Christmas.  During this period, in order to mitigate the risk of ongoing transmission of COVID-19 and the risk COVID-19 may have on vulnerable persons, particularly those in high risk settings such as nursing homes, the overarching public health advice and policy in the context of the current level, Level 3, of the framework for restrictive measures is that residents should not undertake such external visits. </p>  <p>  I appreciate that this may be disappointing for some residents and their family members and acknowledge that 2020 has been a most difficult year for families.  However, this must be considered in the context of the current rate of transmission and the ongoing risk.  The European Centre for Disease Control recently published it latest risk assessment in respect of long-term residential care services.  It clearly concluded that the risk related to COVID-19 infection in EU/EEA and UK is currently considered very high for residents of these services. </p>  <p>  The current guidance reflects the fact that we are at Level 3 and the risks associated with same.  We must be vigilant in ensuring that residents who may be very vulnerable to adverse outcomes as a result of COVID-19 continue to be protected through these public health measures. </p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing homes to facilitate visits in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of facilitating visiting over the Winter period and over Christmas, the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) has been expanded on a once-off basis to allow a claim of up to &euro;2,500 per eligible nursing home.  This will enable them to create additional safe visiting spaces and enhance current visiting spaces.</p>  <p>  Enhancement of safe visiting spaces is aligned with the overriding aim of TAPS, which is to support nursing homes in keeping residents safe and reduce the risk of infection and transmission into the nursing home.  It is recognised that residents and their families will prioritise visiting over this period and these spaces will provide for these visits to be undertaken in a way that reduces the health and other risks of outdoor visiting on residents and their visitors, who may themselves be older and more vulnerable.</p></reply>

This is Phase 1 of the Framework and was implemented and tested through a pilot project across three hospital sites; Beaumont Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and St Columcille's, Loughlinstown. </p><p>The impact reports, using the data collected over two years with the support of a specific ICT system, have validated the initial findings form the pilot test.  There is evidence of sustained improvements to patient outcomes, service and financial efficiencies and a number of staff benefits including increased retention in areas where the Framework has been fully implemented. </p><p>This phase of <i>The Framework</i>was handed over to the HSE in October 2019 for national rollout.  To date the first three Model 4 hospitals have received their uplift and the sequential roll out is continuing.

The contract for the ICT system was delayed due to Covid-19 but will be signed shortly.</p><p>The Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix and the international research and evidence do not support a nurse-to-patient ratio based approach to meet both patient and staff outcomes.  A core assumption of the Framework is that &lsquo;<i>all patient care needs are different&rsquo;, </i>this would<i></i>be undermined if a ratio-based approach was taken as it presume all patients require the same level of nursing care.</p></reply>

When PRSI of approximately 12% is added to this figure, the cost per new senior pharmacist in Year 1 would come to &euro;70,246.40.</p><p>The cost of recruiting two additional full-time senior pharmacists for the NCPE would therefore amount to approximately &euro;140,492.80 in Year 1.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic.</p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the waiting time experienced by the patient, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is directed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and coordinated by the HSE. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Covid-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person. </p>  <p>  While there are no mass testing programmes in place nor plans to implement mass testing in third-level institutions as the Deputy describes, the HSE will offer Covid-19 testing in third level institutions in response to ongoing outbreaks in the student population. A Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) is undertaken and provides an opportunity for students to self-refer for Covid-19 testing. The decision to provide a similar testing facility at any other third-level educational institutes would be based on the undertaking of an appropriate risk assessment. The risk assessment applied in educational settings may be dynamic and change as new information becomes available, and the testing strategy may evolve as information unfolds. </p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. </p>  <p>  The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Those conditions are:</p><p>- Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis</p><p>- Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy</p><p>- Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>For more information relating to the MCAP, including FAQs, please see the Department of Health&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i></p><p>Commercial suppliers whose cannabis products have been reviewed and are considered to have met the specified requirements set out in the legislation and are in line with the clinical guidance for the MCAP, will have their products added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. Once the products are listed in Schedule 1 of these Regulations the suppliers will be permitted to supply these products to the Irish market, in line with legal and regulatory requirements. Cannabis products will only be listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations once they have been assessed as suitable for medical use under the MCAP.</p><p>To date four products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019.

Through our collective efforts, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. Furthermore, as part of the State's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and subject to authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, the good news is that Ireland is on the cusp of deploying at least two COVID-19 vaccines as part of a national vaccination programme.</p><p>The Government has always been clear that a &ldquo;zero covid&rdquo; option is not one that is available to Ireland due to a number of factors, most pertinently the border with Northern Ireland. Our proximity to Europe and the nature of supply chains we are part of, both as an exporter and importer of vital goods, precludes such as approach. The clear advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has been and continues to be that our overarching objective must be to suppress the virus to the lowest level possible and to maintain it at a low level. This is essential for protecting public health and our core priorities of education, health and social care services and protecting the most vulnerable to the disease.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-</i>19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.</p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time. Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. </p><p>The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p><p>Information in relation to the public health measures in place at all levels of the Plan are available at:<i></i></p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  Bipolar disorder is not included on the above list and there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

The Plan for Living with COVID-19 Framework has been developed to help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, with measures aimed at the key priorities of protecting health, strengthening employment, and supporting communities.  The system is communicated through a numbered system of alert Levels, from 1 to 5 with Level 1 being the lowest with the least amount of restrictive measures in place and Level 5 being the highest with the most restrictions in place.  </p>  <p> The Health Protection Surveillance Centre published updated guidance on visitations to long term residential care facilities on 30 November.  The new guidance which came into effect from 7 December, aims to further support long-term residential care services, including nursing homes and residents in planning visits across all levels of the framework for restrictive measures in the government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19. </p>  <p>  This new guidance outlines an updated definition for &lsquo;critical and compassionate circumstances&rsquo;, which now provides that, subject to risk assessment, residents may be facilitated to receive:</p>  <p>  - up to one visit by one person per week under Levels 3 and 4 of the framework;</p>  <p>  - up to one visit by one person per two weeks under Level 5. </p>  <p>  It also notes that at all framework levels every practical effort should be made to accommodate an additional visit on compassionate grounds during the period of a major cultural or religious festival or celebration of particular significance to the resident, such as the Christmas/New Year period.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of facilitating visiting over the Winter period and over Christmas, the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) has been expanded on a once-off basis to allow a claim of up to &euro;2,500 per eligible nursing home. This will enable them to create additional safe visiting spaces and enhance current visiting spaces.</p>  <p>  Enhancement of safe visiting spaces is aligned with the overriding aim of TAPS, which is to support nursing homes in keeping residents safe and reduce the risk of infection and transmission into the nursing home. It is recognised that residents and their families will prioritise visiting over this period and these spaces will provide for these visits to be undertaken in a way that reduces the health and other risks of outdoor visiting on residents and their visitors, who may themselves be older and more vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  I have communicated with the sector outlining the need for them to be flexible, innovative and to facilitate visiting arrangements, in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On 19 November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities across Europe. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>  This highlights the importance of suppressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.</p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.  </p><p>Physical distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services.</p><p>Despite these challenges, by December 4th, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland had carried out 304 scoliosis procedures, 150 of which were spinal fusions, 25 fewer than the same period last year. 154 other spinal procedures were carried out, 27 fewer than last year. </p><p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised my Department that as of 4 December, there were 120 patients on the spinal fusion waiting list, an increase of 21 compared to the start of the year. There were 74 patients on the waiting list for other spinal procedures, which is a decrease of 10 patients since the start of 2020.  </p><p>Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is exploring initiatives to increase access to scoliosis services, such as transferring additional patients to the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh for treatment.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is trying to source additional capacity in Private Hospitals. </p><p>In recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. </p><p>This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.</p><p>Children's Health Ireland has also advised that a General Orthopaedic Surgeon, based at CHI Crumlin and Tallaght sites, took up post in Q3, 2020. This surgeon will help address waiting times for children for general orthopaedic outpatient appointments, including scoliosis.</p></reply>

The policy's objective is to deliver interventions that meet the individual needs of a service user, regardless of gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background. The policy recognises that priority groups, including the Traveller community, may need tailored interventions, including targeted campaigns, preventive outreach work and the provision of services that recognise and respond to diversity. This includes the development of culturally competent services and supports.  This will be achieved in partnership with organisations working with priority groups, to increase effectiveness and impact.</p><p>Minister Butler recently met with the National Traveller Mental Health Network regarding <i>Sharing the Vision</i>. It was agreed that, as a representative group of the Traveller and Roma community, it would participate in the implementation structures of the new policy.</p><p>The National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC), which is tasked with responsibility for driving implementation of Sharing the Vision, comprises a Steering Committee, chaired by Mr John Saunders, (which held its inaugural meeting on 11<sup>th</sup>December) and an associated Specialist Group Panel.  Of the nominees sought from organisations representing the Traveller community, including the National Traveller Mental Health Network, six individuals were appointed to the Specialist Group Panel.</p><p>In addition, The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) is the Government policy framework for addressing health and other needs of Travellers and Roma. It contains over 30 health-related actions in four themes. The Department of Health and the HSE are represented on the steering committee for NTRIS and report on a regular basis on the various health actions.</p><p>The Department of Health, in conjunction with the HSE, supports a range of targeted initiatives, programmes and supports to improve the health status of Travellers and Roma. These include:</p><p>- primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes, men's health projects and dedicated public health nurses and related staff;</p><p>- mental health promotion and suicide prevention services provided in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.</p><p>In November 2020, Connecting for Life, the national suicide reduction strategy was extended for a further four years from 2020 to 2024. The extension will allow for further implementation of the strategy comprising targeted approaches for those vulnerable to suicide, including members of the Traveller community.</p><p>The HSE employs a number of public health nurses and related staff to address priority health needs for members of the Traveller community. In addition, each Community Health Organisation employs a Traveller&rsquo;s Mental Health Service coordinator, who is responsible for the implementation of agreed improvement programmes and projects specifically aimed at the Traveller community.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds.</p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031.</p>  <p>  The Winter Plan progress report provided by the HSE on the 10th of December 2020 shows that a total of 466 acute, sub acute and intermediate care beds have been provided. Of these beds 239 were acute beds, 176 intermediate care, and the remaining 51 were sub acute beds.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Winter Plan will, inter alia,  see an additional 892 acute beds, 484 sub acute beds, 631 additional rehabilitation beds, 4.7 million additional home support hours, additional community based services and an expanded flu vaccination programme to reduce pressure on hospital emergency departments.</p>  <p>  In view of the scale of the investment it is important that implementation of the Plan is monitored and that the outcomes and outputs of the various elements of the plan are reported.</p>  <p>  My Department has communicated to the HSE the reporting requirements to allow it to effectively monitor the Plan's implementation. The HSE has put in place a Programme Management Office to manage the implementation of the Plan.

As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020.</p>  <p>  The additional critical care beds referenced in the HSE Winter Plan are encompassed within the Budget 2021 allocation. Their inclusion in the plan reinforces the HSE's commitment to opening these beds over the winter 2020/2021 period.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that this framework will comprise primary legislation to provide for the licensing of home support providers, minimum standards, and HIQA national standards.</p>  <p>  The successful development of a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services is an ambitious programme of reform. The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme by the end of 2021 and significant substantive incremental progress on key elements of the scheme will be achieved by this time.  However key enablers of the scheme that were due to be progressed in 2020, such as the  roll out of the  standard assessment tool (interRAI), were deferred due to COVID-19 and are now occurring in 2021 and funding has been prioritised as part the 2021 National Service Plan.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.  </p><p>My Department does not collate information on the cost of vaccines paid for privately.</p></reply>

These changes were introduced following consultation with the farm organisations in accordance with the Farmers Charter of Rights.  While these error letters related to BPS, they could also impact on an ANC application where that error was linked to ANC eligible land.</p>  <p>  Letters in relation to over claims, overlaps and dual claims were no longer posted where the farmer had:  </p>  <p>  (a) employed an agricultural agent to act on their behalf, </p>  <p>  or </p>  <p>  (b) had registered for the Department's Online Services themselves and had also signed up to  receive text message alerts from the Department. </p>  <p>  Farmers received a text message notification when these error letter issued electronically and, where they had an agent, their agricultural agents received an email notification.  Instead of receiving a hard copy, farmers could log in to www.agfood.ie, view these letters and respond to them instantly, thereby helping to speed up processing of their applications.  </p>  <p>  These three letter types (dealing with over claims, overlaps and dual claims) continued to be posted to farmers who did not satisfy at least one of the two conditions (a) and (b) outlined above. In addition, where a required response was not received to these notifications, a follow up letter was posted. Therefore, farmers would still be able to correspond in writing if they had difficulty in using the online system.</p>  <p>  All other BPS letters continued to issue by post to all farmers.  The number of farmers not receiving ANC payments for reasons other than stocking density remains low as a percentage of eligible applicants, and the change in the approach to issuing BPS letters has contributed to the increased levels of payments issuing across the ANC scheme and BPS in 2020.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of the Covid-19 market disturbance.  </p><p>One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be a slight element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme. In return for the payment of exceptional aid, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the period 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019.</p><p>Obligations under the measure were developed based on analysis of the herd profile and nitrates profile of the national herd.  It was designed, in consultation with farmer representative organisations, to make the measure as easy to participate in as possible, whilst maintaining the requirement under the implementing regulation for temporary market adjustments.  Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some &euro;77.72M as part of the scheme. </p><p>It is not intended to amend the scheme requirement because the exceptional aid was granted to Ireland on the basis of this nitrogen reduction being implemented.  However, my Department continues to put in place supports for farmers to assist them in managing their commitments under the Scheme and my Department will shortly be writing to all BEAM applicants in this regard.  </p><p>I have also instructed agri planners to engage with their clients to continue to inform and assist them around the requirements of the scheme.</p></reply>

The centre will allow greyhounds to be socialised and for interested parties to consider the fostering or adoption of a greyhound in such a setting.<br /><br />The implementation of an extensive rehoming programme with 1470 greyhounds rehomed in 2020 to end of November with assistance from the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, an entity established by RC&Eacute;.  <br /><br />The introduction of a financial incentive for all domestic rehomings to encourage further rehoming in Ireland.<br /><br />The implementation of a Foster-to-Adopt Scheme.<br /><br />The operation of an Injuries at Track Financial Support Scheme whereby funding is available to address injuries sustained to racing greyhounds.<br /><br />The establishment of a confidential phone line/email through which any welfare issues can be reported on a 24/7 basis.

The urine sampling regime has been expanded in 2020 to cover blood sampling (on a periodic basis).  Work is also underway in terms of the necessary protocols to implement further enhancements of the testing regime through hair sampling.<br /><br />RC&Eacute; implemented a Covid-19 Care Payment Scheme during the period of suspension of racing activity from March to June 2020.

This allows us to ensure that those most in need are able to access services and supports and that we deliver outcomes that positively impact the quality of life of those living and working in our communities. This has been of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic this year, where such communication has assisted us in identifying supports or funding needs and the most appropriate remedial or proactive measures that can be taken in response.</p>  <p>  These engagements include groups involved in rural development, the community and voluntary sector and smaller local community groups and organisations, while we also collaborate and seek the views of other Government Departments and the statutory bodies under the aegis of the Department in regard to these issues. </p>  <p>  One example of proactive interaction with communities was the delivery in 2019, in conjunction with Pobal, of a series of 'Helping Hands' events nationwide, to engage with communities and create awareness and understanding of funding programmes. Feedback from these interactions was very positive, and it is hoped that similar events could be scheduled in the future when permitted by public safety advice. </p>  <p>  Several consultation processes sought submissions from community groups in 2020. These include my Department's new Statement of Strategy and the new Rural Development Policy, both of which I expect to publish in the near future, and the new National Volunteering Strategy, which was launched by my colleague, Minister of State Joe O'Brien, earlier this month.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage proactively with its stakeholders during the COVID-19 crisis through various on line means. This engagement has helped deliver solutions including additional funding to address challenges being faced by those in communities and their representative groups at this time, and I look forward to continuing these interactions moving forward.</p></reply>

The Community Services Programme is of particular importance, with funding of over &euro;45 million supporting around 450 community-based organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model and create employment opportunities for disadvantaged people. The Community Enhancement Programme channelled small grant supports of over &euro;11 million to community groups throughout the country this year, with a particular focus on the community response to Covid-19. I would also note that the Covid-19 Stability Fund has provided &euro;45 million in grant supports to C&amp;V organisations, charities and social enterprises in 2020 - with around 600 organisations benefitting from these substantial supports. Finally, the LEADER programme is providing significant funding to rural areas and communities, with &euro;45 million being spent on the programme this year supporting both rural enterprises and rural community groups. </p>  <p>  The supports provided to community groups, in both rural and urban areas, are a vital part of the work of my Department and I am pleased with the level of funding, and the responsiveness of that funding, in 2020.

The issue of isolation in communities cut across the work of a number of Departments, and this is reflected in ongoing work on community policing, rural transport and social inclusion, among other areas.</p>  <p>  Many of my Department's policies and funding programmes aim to address isolation issues in communities, and also deliver benefits by responding to the challenges facing vulnerable individuals due to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Physical and social isolation can have a significant impact on people living in rural areas. My Department is finalising a new rural development policy for the next five years, which will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019. The policy will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural communities and will identify policy measures for delivery in order to achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>  Other key interventions include funding the Seniors Alert Scheme, which enables older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring contact is maintained with those who are vulnerable. </p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 Action Plan, increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical supports for those who need it.</p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention, delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need access supports to enable participation in communities. SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their localities are responded to.</p>  <p>  Local Development Companies (LDCs) have put in place various measures to ensure SICAP supports continue to be delivered and that vulnerable people continue to be supported throughout the COVID-19 crises, examples as follows:</p>  <p>  Online supports are delivered via telephone, email, Zoom, etc., with LDCs providing additional support to individuals with limited access to technology, in the form providing them with laptops/tablets and upskilling them in their usage. </p>  <p>  - LDCs that operate a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing local community groups to become involved in making regular contact with older, vulnerable isolated people during COVID. </p>  <p>  - LDCs supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing food poverty. </p>  <p>  - Other responses included Pharmacy &amp;amp; Shopping Services; Employment and Self-Employment Supports; Supports to Community Groups; Online Training; Health, Well-Being and Social Prescribing; Mental Health Supports. </p>  <p>  - My  Department offered every flexibility to the Local Development Companies (LDCs) which freed up SICAP workers to focus on a community response to the crisis. Given their presence in local communities, the LDC response to the crisis was rapid and widespread with many of their 170,000 service users reached in the early days and weeks of the crisis.</p>  <p>  Volunteering is also very much at the forefront of initiatives of this nature and the Department will continue to support volunteering both by the provision of funding and other supports, and the implementation of the recently published National Volunteering Strategy. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) funding will ensure that remote areas, particularly those that are likely to wait longest for connections, are provided with access to high-speed broadband in their communities while waiting for the National Broadband Plan roll-out to reach them. </p>  <p>  The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme (T&amp;V) has been tailored to include projects which adapt outdoor spaces for hosting social gatherings/events to support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages while living with COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation during the coming months. </p></reply>
