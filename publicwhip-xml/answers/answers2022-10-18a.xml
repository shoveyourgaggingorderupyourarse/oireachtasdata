The Office also keeps the High-Level Steering Board on Policing Reform, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, apprised of progress being made. In addition, progress is reported to the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, which I chair. </p><p><i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>has been broken down in to four stages of implementation, namely:</p><p>1. The <i>Building Blocks</i>Phase;</p><p>2. The <i>Launching Phase</i>;</p><p>3. The <i>Scaling</i>Phase; and</p><p>4. The <i>Consolidation</i>Phase.</p><p>The first three phases of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>have been completed and much has been achieved. For example:</p> <blockquote> 	- The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide is underway; </blockquote>   <blockquote> 	- The recruitment of nearly 1800 garda staff which has supported the reassignment of many garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties;<br /><br />- Roll-out of over 5000 digital communication devices enabling front-line gardai to perform their duties without returning to stations;<br /><br />- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;<br /><br />- Local Community Safety Partnership Pilots have been established in three locations around the country, in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford City and County and Longford County; <br /><br />- The development by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement, and Action Plan 2020-2021; and<br /><br />- launch of a three-year Garda Health and Wellbeing Strategy, which will see the introduction of additional health and wellbeing supports. </blockquote>  <p>There has also been progress on legislative reform. The Government has approved the drafting of:</p> <blockquote> 	- the landmark Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill which provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation; <br /><br />- the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill, which concerns the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras); and<br /><br />- the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill which brings together and modernises police powers of search, arrest and detention. </blockquote>  <p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Functions and Operational Area) Act 2022, which will facilitate the roll out of the new operating model, was brought into law earlier this year.</p><p>The future focus of the Programme for the final or <i>Consolidation Phase</i>will be on several key organisational and corporate enablers to assist in achieving a sustainable transformation of policing. </p><p>This includes areas such as IT, HR and finance, which are key enablers across the entire reform programme, as well the necessary legislation, Operating Model, Community Safety and Non-Core Duties.</p></reply>

In delivering Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement to the General Assembly, I said that all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security, and to economic and social development; and that all people have the right to live in dignity; to have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected. I spoke frankly also about the need for a strengthened and reformed United Nations, one that is not hamstrung by the veto power of a single member state. </p>  <p>  I noted, however, that this is not the case for those currently facing hunger and food insecurity, nor for those in Ukraine being bombarded by Russian missiles, nor for many people in Syria, Afghanistan or Palestine. I spoke also of the devastating impacts of climate change, with those who bear least responsibility for its causes often most affected.</p></reply>

The majority of PhD students are in receipt of grants from their individual institutions and research funders such as the IRC and SFI.  </p>  <p>  Other research funders in the national system include, e.g., the Health Research Board and Teagasc. There are also typically a number of PhDs funded through European Programmes and individual Higher Education Institution (HEI) schemes. The Department allocates recurrent funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions and as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>Of the bodies referred to in the question, my Department has responsibility for SFI and the IRC and can only provide detailed information relating to these bodies. In this regard, as at the 1st of September, there were 2,022 PhD Students directly attributed to active SFI awards and the Irish Research Council is currently supporting 1,143 PhD researchers across its range of funding programmes.  </p></reply>

I can confirm that this additional maintenance grant payment will be paid on the 16th December to eligible students. </p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I have also increased the Maintenance Grant rates by 14% for those on the Special and Band 1 rate of grant and by 10% for all other Maintenance grant holders.  Importantly, for students in the current academic year the change in rates will be <i>effective</i>from January 2023 so students in the current academic year will see their grant payments increase proportionately once this measure comes into effect in January. </p><p>To put this in context a SUSI maintenance grant holder in the 22/23 academic year who is a recipient of the <i>Special Rate non-adjacent rate</i>will benefit by over &euro;1,000 from both the additional maintenance payment and increase of grant rates effective from January 2023. </p><p>As the deputy will appreciate the SUSI application process is still open and applications are still being processed. However, as of the 7th of October, SUSI data shows that 49,408 students are expected to benefit from the additional monthly maintenance payment. I will of course arrange for the full breakdown of this data on a County by County basis to be sent directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

Courses that are part-time, less than two years in duration or leading to a special purpose or minor award, rather than a major award, are not approved for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme. Online and Distance Learning Courses are regarded as part-time courses for student grant purposes and, as such, do not qualify for grant assistance.</p>  <p>  I have recently published three significant policy documents which will shape the evolution of the student support scheme over the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Review of the Student Grant Scheme contains a recommendation that the Government should consider extending supports to more flexible forms of learning including blended/online &amp;amp; part-time.</p>  <p>  The National Access Plan, which I launched in August, contains five student centred goals, one of which is flexibility and a key objective in this regard is to better support priority group students who study on a flexible basis.</p>  <p>  Finally Funding the Future sets out a multi-annual funding and reform framework for higher education, including the need to support more flexible forms of learning.</p>  <p>  To take forward implementation of Funding the Future, I established a steering group which I chair alongside Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins. Two working groups have been established led by Professors Looney and Collins. The working group focused on skills, participation and cost is examining the potential to support students to avail of more flexible learning opportunities.</p>  <p>I will consider the product of this work, and also any engagement which will take place with the sector on managing delivery from an institutional perspective, in the context of future Estimates processes and alongside other priorities in the Funding the Future framework.  </p></reply>

It must be recognised, however, that fundamentally, the challenge is one of supply of housing more generally.  That is why Government launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion.</p>  <p>  This summer I met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities (TUs) to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified for additional student accommodation.</p>  <p>  In a welcome development, the sector indicates that hundreds of additional bed spaces have been made available by higher education institutions for the start of this academic year and University of Galway is to deliver some 674 new bed spaces later next year.</p>  <p>  I also brought a proposal on student accommodation to the Cabinet Committee on Housing and received support to progress a new policy that supports the delivery of additional purpose-built student accommodation.</p>  <p>  This would involve the State for the first time assisting higher education institutions with the cost of building student accommodation so as to ensure increased availability and promote greater access in particular for priority student groups in line with the national access plan.  To advance this work I have recently established a dedicated Student Accommodation Unit to draft an updated policy for Student Housing and Accommodation as a matter of urgency. This unit will lead the examination and development of a range of policy options to increase supply in the context of Government's overall Housing for All policy.</p>  <p>  Government has also implemented restrictions to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up-front for their accommodation.  The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit is now no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent &ndash; that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit. In addition, student accommodation is subject to rent pressure zone caps and students now have recourse to the Residential Tenancies Board for dispute resolution where appropriate.</p>  <p>  It is also open to homeowners to rent a room to students and homeowners can rent a room, retain their social welfare entitlements where applicable, and earn up to &euro;14,000 in rental income before having to pay tax.  All higher education institutions continue to support their students to find accommodation in the private rental sector.  Institutions are actively promoting this option in their localities. This is an approach Government fully supports and encourages.</p></reply>

As apprentices are employees the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employer base in a sector.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are offered by employers throughout the country. Off-the-job training for the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes is held in Training Centres and Institutes of Technology/Technological Universities, with certain locations specialising in specific apprenticeship programmes due to the need for specific workshop equipment and trainer expertise.</p>  <p>  While efforts are made to offer training within reasonable distances of an apprentice&rsquo;s geographical location, for some off the job training programmes this is not always possible.</p>  <p>  The number of new apprenticeship registrations for the so-called "wet trades" including painting and decorating dropped during the last economic downturn and has not recovered at the same rate as other construction trades. As of September 2022, within an overall population of craft apprentices of 21,190, there is a total of 106 apprentices undertaking an apprenticeship in painting and decorating, with only 12 apprentices newly registered to date this year. </p>  <p>  Given the relatively small numbers of annual registrations for the painter and decorating apprenticeship it is not currently feasible or cost-effective to offer off-the-job training phase in multiple locations.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that where apprentices are required to move from their current place of residence in order to take up a training place they can apply for an accommodation allowance amounting to a maximum of &euro;69.90 per week, in addition to their weekly training allowance, for the duration of the training phase.</p></reply>

Further details of the programmes, including locations where the training will be available once the validation and legislative processes are finalised.</p>  <p>  These new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning, provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners and will play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.

These minimum rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four.</p><p>Periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund with payments of the agreed rate made directly to craft apprentices by the education and training boards during this time.</p><p>Training allowances for apprentices are calculated with reference to gross-wage norms payable in industry for the different trade sectors. The actual allowance received will generally be less as it is based on the net take home pay calculated based on the gross wage norm. The gross-wage norm is per week and the norm to be used will be determined by the industry in which the employer is engaged.</p><p>On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates.</p><p>While attending off-the-job training, craft apprentices are paid a training allowance appropriate to their training phase.  In addition to training allowances, craft apprentices attending phases of off-the-job training in an Education and Training Board (ETB) training centre, Institute of Technology, or a Technological University are entitled to make an application for either travel or accommodation allowances for the duration of the period of off-the-job training.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023 I announced a cost-of-living package for students, and investment in third level education for 2023. Included in this was a once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices and additional funding for social inclusion measures in apprenticeship, such as a bursary for apprentices from under-represented groups.</p><p>As employees, apprentices who find themselves in difficulty are correspondingly entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system.  I would also advise any apprentice to discuss the matter with their Authorised Officer who may be in a position to provide guidance  <b><i>.  </i></b></p></reply>

For the academic year 2022/23, I increased the income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant by &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I have secured a significant cost of living package for third level students including a once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes.</p>  <p>  The once off &euro;1,000 support relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under the Department free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. It will reduce the student contribution payable for free fees eligible students from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have made two changes to the income thresholds for the student contribution grant for the academic year 2023/24 which will reduce the cost of education for students and families. I have increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution and introduced a new Student Contribution grant to the value of &euro;500 for qualifying families on incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. It is estimated that between 42,500 and 50,000 families could receive support under the Student Grant Scheme in 2023 for the first time as a result of these measures.</p>  <p>  I have introduced two further measures whereby income up to &euro;14,000 as declared to Revenue under the Government's Rent a Room Scheme will not be counted as reckonable income when calculating eligibility for the 2023/2024 academic year. In addition, the holiday earnings provision under the Student Grant Scheme will allow for a deduction up to a maximum amount of &euro;6552 (an increase from &euro;4500) to be applied to student earnings outside of term time within the reference period when calculating reckonable income for grant eligibility for the 2023/2024 academic year.  As a result of both measures some students may find that they will receive a higher rate of grant and some new students may also find themselves eligible for a grant for the first time once these measures are introduced.</p>  <p>  In addition, for the 2022/2023 Academic Year, a further &euro;8 million of funding has been secured for the Student Assistance Fund for the current academic year.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Fund provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It is designed to provide a source of financial support in addition to a SUSI grant.</p>  <p>  Applications can be made under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) through the Access Office in the third level institution you are attending. They will have more information concerning their own HEI. More information on this fund and other supports are also available at www.studentfinance.ie. </p></reply>

In other words, ensuring that the profile of the apprenticeship population more closely reflects the profile of the general population. As per the latest data available there are 1,744 female apprentices, up from 60 in 2016 and only 665 at the end of 2019, and representing 7% of the overall apprentice population. </p><p>While this increase is mainly due to the expansion of apprenticeship into new areas, it is also important to note that female representation in craft apprenticeship has doubled in the last 2/3 years and participation in industry areas such as Manufacturing and Engineering is also increasing. Women also feature more strongly in the new apprenticeships in the hospitality, healthcare, property, sales, biopharma and ICT sectors. </p><p>Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the development of the apprenticeship system. The actions set out in the Plan build on the outcomes of the 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship which has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships.</p><p>The Action Plan contains a number of key deliverables designed to secure significantly greater diversity by:- </p><p>- including the voice of under-represented cohorts in apprenticeship;</p><p>- putting in place an inclusive apprenticeship access and delivery structure; and</p><p>- monitoring and assessing targets and developing appropriate interventions.</p><p>On 14th April I announced a new gender-based bursary for apprenticeship employers as part of the national <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025</i>. The bursary, which is worth &euro;2,666, is available to employers who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is being implemented with effect from 01 January 2022, and covers all new apprentice registrations from that date on eligible national apprenticeship programmes. The apprenticeship gender-based bursary is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022. Currently there are 41 programmes eligible for the bursary.</p><p>This bursary is in addition to the Government supports that apprenticeship employers receive via the craft training allowance and the employer grant.</p><p>Information on apprenticeship was included on the CAO website for the first time for CAO 2022. This is expected to make a significant contribution to showing the range of learning and qualification options for school leavers. As part of this landmark change, a freephone helpline has been introduced for learners, parents and guidance counsellors to provide information on apprenticeship, including how to find an employer. The helpline supplements the existing guidance counsellor service at post-primary and further education and training levels.</p><p>There has also been a specific focus on female participation as part of the Generation Apprenticeship national promotional campaign. SOLAS ran a media campaign over three weeks in January 2021 promoting the apprenticeship route and celebrating diversity and the 1,000th female apprentice.</p><p>An all-female Software Developer Associate Apprenticeship programme commenced in November 2019 in conjunction with Fastrack into IT (FIT).  It is a 2 year course offered at level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications.  The off the job training is being delivered by Liberties College which is under the remit of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board. A high level of interest has been reported in this programme to date.</p><p>The general push towards women in STEM roles under the STEM Education Strategy and the ICT Skills Action Plan should also feed through to the apprenticeship intakes.</p><p>I am satisfied that these measures and the implementation process for the Apprenticeship Action Plan overall will have a significant impact in ensuring greater diversity in the apprenticeship population as a whole.  </p></reply>

Courses that are part-time, less than two years in duration or leading to a special purpose or minor award, rather than a major award, are not approved for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme.

Two working groups have been established led by Professors Looney and Collins. The working group focused on skills, participation and cost is examining the potential to support students to avail of more flexible learning opportunities.</p>  <p>  I will consider the product of this work, and also any engagement which will take place with the sector on managing delivery from an institutional perspective, in the context of future Estimates processes and alongside other priorities in the Funding the Future framework.</p></reply>

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part or in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The once off reduction of &euro;1,000 relates specifically to the student contribution payable by students eligible for free tuition fees under my Department's free fees schemes in academic year 22/23 and will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. In this regard all full time undergraduate students eligible for free fees and paying the student contribution will benefit from this measure. </p>  <p>  As the 2022/23 academic year is only now getting underway, we do not have enrolment figures yet; however, I can advise the Deputy that in 22/23 it is estimated that over 149,000 Irish and EU full time undergraduate students will be eligible for free fees. This means that, in addition to the SUSI eligible students receiving a student contribution support, an estimated 94,000 free fees eligible students will benefit from this measure alone at a cost of c.&euro;95.6million.</p>  <p>  As part of the cost of living measures I secured additional supports for students including:</p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  For any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the aforementioned Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p></reply>

It will reduce the student contribution payable for free fees eligible students from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have made two changes to the income thresholds for the student contribution grant for the academic year 2023/24 which will reduce the cost of education for students and families. I have increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution and introduced a new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. It is estimated that between 42,500 and 50,000 families could receive support under the Student Grant Scheme in 2023 for the first time as a result of these measures.</p>  <p>  I have introduced two further measures whereby income up to &euro;14,000 as declared to Revenue under the Government's Rent a Room Scheme will not be counted as reckonable income when calculating eligibility for the 2023/2024 academic year. In addition, the holiday earnings provision under the Student Grant Scheme will allow for a deduction up to a maximum amount of &euro;6552 (an increase from &euro;4500) to be applied to student earnings outside of term time within the reference period when calculating reckonable income for grant eligibility for the 2023/2024 academic year.  As a result of both measures some students may find that they will receive a higher rate of grant and some new students may also find themselves eligible for a grant for the first time once these measures are introduced.</p>  <p>  In addition, for the 2022/2023 Academic Year, a further &euro;8 million of funding has been secured for the Student Assistance Fund for the current academic year.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Fund provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It is designed to provide a source of financial support in addition to a SUSI grant.</p>  <p>  Applications can be made under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) through the Access Office in the third level institution you are attending. They will have more information concerning their own HEI. More information on this fund and other supports are also available at www.studentfinance.ie.</p></reply>

In this context, the Departments of Health and of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have jointly published the Second One Health National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2021-2025. Strategic Objective 5 of this plan will promote research and sustainable investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.</p><p>A high-performing health service requires health research and innovation being embedded in service delivery, and clinicians and other health professionals being supported to undertake and utilise research.

These funding programmes are available to researchers working the area of antibiotic development, subject to programme specific eligibility criteria.</p><p>The IRC is currently supporting a University of Galway researcher working on antimicrobial agents under the Laureate award programme, and 21 researchers under its early-career programmes concerned with this area, namely the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme, the Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme, the Enterprise Partnership Scheme and the Employment-Based Postgraduate Programme.</p><p>The vast majority of SFI funding programmes do not run on a thematic basis &ndash; i.e., they are open to researchers from all disciplines operating within SFI&rsquo;s legal remit. Examples of researchers that are availing of SFI supports to advance the area of antibiotic development include:</p><p>- Prof Martin Caffrey at TCD is investigating new approaches to antibiotic design through a SFI Investigator Programme award which will generate new knowledge and intellectual property in the form of tools, reagents and lead compounds for commercial exploitation.</p><p>- Prof Siobhan McClean and her team at UCD is using cystic fibrosis infections as models to understand how bacteria change to become chronic infections and how low-oxygen levels drive this process. Identifying these common routes of adaptation will help us stop this evolution and represent a target for development of new therapies for chronic infections. </p><p>Research into AMR is central to the development of future therapies. Many SFI funded teams are working in this area. APC Microbiome Ireland SFI Research Centre is conducting significant work in the area of the development of new natural antimicrobials (such as bacteriocins and bacteriophages) being important in the fight against AMR. A project with Janssen is particularly relevant - Bacteriophage have been shown to have tremendous promise as narrow spectrum antimicrobial agents that can replace or augment our current arsenal of antibiotics. A significant benefit of their narrow spectrum is that they will not generate resistance in non-target species, nor will they cause collateral damage to the human (or environmental) microbiome. This research aims to develop bacteriophage applications for the diagnosis or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. </p><p>APC also focuses on AMR as part of their Education and Public Engagement Programme. For instance, work they have done on nationwide professional development for teachers with JCT STE(A)M. To support secondary school teachers, APC invested significant time-resources to develop and deliver workshops in partnership with the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) programme, JCT STEAM. The objectives of JCT STEAM align closely with those of the APC&rsquo;s EPE programme &ndash; it aims to provide teachers with rich professional learning experiences that focus on equipping teachers and students with skills and knowledge needed to address global societal challenges. The workshops, which place a large emphasis on interdisciplinarity, are open to all teachers, not just those teaching STEM subjects. APC co-developed a workshop on the topic of Antimicrobial Resistance, with colleagues in the School of Pharmacy at UCC, to connect microbiome research with the SDGs in a classroom-ready format.</p><p>SSPC, SFI Research Centre for Pharmaceuticals is also active in this space. Prof Martin Clynes is leading a project to develop new antimicrobial therapies. The project aims to will identify novel antimicrobial agents with modes of action distinct to those of existing agents and evaluate these for clinical use.</p><p>As part of the <i>Impact 2030</i>, my department has established strong governance and oversight structures to deliver its vision and ambition. The Impact 2030 Steering Group and Impact 2030 Implementation Forum bring together research funding departments and agencies to ensure that we deliver not only on <i>Impact 2030</i>but that R&amp;amp;I makes a significant impact on key national and sectoral priorities, including maximising research and innovation contribution to sustaining and furthering the health and wellbeing of the people of Ireland.</p><p>Through these avenues the national R&amp;amp;I system will work together to address the many challenges outlined in <i>Impact 2030</i>, including the health and wellbeing of the Irish people.</p></reply>

They include a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Energy Systems at DCU, a Postgraduate Diploma in Wind Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology, a Certificate in Energy Sustainability at South East Technological University; and an MEng in Energy Infrastructure at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest.</p>  <p>  Skillnet Ireland provides subsidised training to business through learning networks operating nationwide and across all sectors. It is a direct response to skills needs as identified by employers. The Green Tech Skillnet is an enterprise-led network facilitating the workforce and development needs of the Irish renewable energy industry. It is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future. </p>  <p>  Sustainable green skills are embedded in the Further Education and Training Strategy, which provides that climate change and sustainable development are key components of Further Education and Training (FET) processes. FET will continue to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s call of action to prioritise energy, building and the environment in its processes.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the SOLAS Green Skills Action Plan will contribute to clean technologies and the acceleration of the use of renewables. It will contribute to a greater awareness of energy efficiency and the benefits of retrofitting both public and private buildings.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, an agreement was reached on a pilot project to be launched between the Campus des m&eacute;tiers et des qualifications d&rsquo;excellence international normand des &eacute;nergies (CEINE) in Normandy, Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, Kerry ETB, Laois Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB and Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan ETB. These organisations will seek to build on their shared expertise in the field of Green Technologies Skills.</p>  <p>  The Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician (WTMT) Apprenticeship was launched in March 2022. Kerry ETB is the coordinating provider for this Level 6 three year apprenticeship. It is estimated that there will be in the region of 18 registrations by year end. This Apprenticeship is for people who wish to pursue a career in the maintenance of large scale commercial wind turbines. It is designed to meet the needs of the growing Irish renewable and sustainable energy sector. This apprenticeship will create a pathway into this career for school leavers or those who do not currently possess any relevant qualifications.</p>  <p>  A dynamic and evolving economy will always have skills demands and challenges. Our imperative is to ensure agility and responsiveness in the skills ecosystem. To help this approach, we commissioned a comprehensive skills review with the OECD. We are more than halfway through this and clear areas of focus are emerging. These include having more dynamic, granular, real-time data to inform how we respond rapidly to industry's needs. We want to do more on short, flexible and blended skilling options for individuals entering or transitioning in the workforce, and we are progressing ease of navigability through options for skilling.</p>  <p>  Embedding this approach will significantly enhance and future-proof provision in the broader green skills area. </p></reply>

However, the State does provide support to institutions for Graduate Entry Medicine programmes in order to widen access and assist the students pursuing these programmes.</p>  <p>  In this context, the fees of EU students enrolled in graduate entry medicine are partly subsidised by the state via the Higher Education Authority. As of the 2021/2022 academic year, the State contribution is &euro;11,950 per student per year. The balance of fees is payable by the student.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government approved a proposal from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Health to increase the number of medicine places per annum by 200 by 2026, and move the funding of medicine places to a more sustainable basis. This has included an increase of 60 in 2022. 55 of these places are on direct entry programmes, and 5 are Graduate Entry Medicine.</p>  <p>  For new Graduate Entry Medicine places, the State contribution will increase to &euro;14,500 per student per year. For existing places, the State&rsquo;s contribution will also be increased to this level on a phased basis.  </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme Review comments on the issue of Graduate Entry Medicine and states that a wider issue remains as to whether greater flexibility in the criteria for the student grant scheme could be considered in areas of critical skills shortage reflecting graduate entry routes. There are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations, as well as wider implications, if the current treatment of graduate entry medicine were to be amended. However, all elements of the review will be subject to consideration by my Department through the annual estimates processes.</p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (NAP) identifies target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education who would not have considered attending higher education without such supports.   The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanism established to implement the National Access Plan (NAP).   There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH).   Strand 2 provides bursaries (1916 Bursary) to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. I have recently changed the rules so that students who hold a 1916 Bursary may continue their bursary if they wish to participate in Graduate Entry Medicine.</p>  <p>  Students on Graduate Entry Medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

All students eligible for the free fees schemes receive State support whereby the State pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution.</p><p>The student contribution applies annually to all free fees eligible students and the current rate is &euro;3,000 per annum. The State pays the student contribution, in full or part, on behalf of students who qualify under the student grant scheme.</p><p>In Budget 2023, in recognition of the cost of living challenges faced by students paying the full student contribution fee, we have introduced a once off reduction of &euro;1,000 in academic year 2022/23. This additional level of support towards tuition fees will benefit almost 94,000 students at a cost to the State of c.&euro;95.6million net. </p><p>Furthermore, I have been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families, compared to the State's contribution, is too high.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I made two changes to student contribution thresholds to reduce the cost of education for students and families (for college year 2023/24):</p><p>- increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution;</p><p>- new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. </p><p>In May this year, I convened the Funding the Future Implementation and Review Group. Comprised of members of the Department, higher education sector and union and industry partners, the FFIRG is committed to addressing the questions of pathways and access to higher education. Financial barriers are clearly a large part of these issues and form core considerations for the FFIRG and its Working Groups. </p><p>I will continue to examine all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.</p></reply>

We recognise the changes which have taken place and the response needed to support innovation in construction. We also recognise the need for targeted, collaborative and industry- focused opportunities available across the tertiary education and training system. </p><p>A key objective of the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 </i>is to ensure that the apprenticeship system will increase its contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s skills and human capital requirements by delivering on a target of 10,000 annual apprenticeship registrations by 2025.</p><p>Among the 66 apprenticeships currently available, construction-related programmes include electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship. Curricula in existing apprenticeships are updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations.</p><p>In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered. This was an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pre-pandemic year. Of these registrations 62%, or 5,337, were in what we deem construction apprenticeship programmes. As of the end of September 2022, there have been 3,296 registrations in construction apprenticeships.</p><p>The Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 was launched on the 23rd March. It incorporates the National Recovery and Resilience Plan 2021 (NRRP), and the Green Skills Action Programme which begun in 2021. The NRRP committed &euro;29M to NZEB &amp;amp; Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes and &euro;10M to Green Skills Modules. Under the Plan, 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places and 60,000 green skills places are to be provided by the end of 2022.</p><p>Three Centres of Excellence for NZEB and retrofitting training are officially opened in Waterford-Wexford ETB, Laois-Offaly ETB and Limerick-Clare ETB. Courses are also being delivered in Cork ETB and Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim ETB, and further courses will be provide through a sixth centre in Finglas, under CDETB.</p><p>The FutureBuilding Initiative was launched in May this year, with an aim to spearhead activation and recruitment for the construction sector along with supporting the industry by significantly scaling-up in education and training opportunities. It is a joint initiative between my Department and that of my colleague, Minister Humphreys. Recognising that we need to change the narrative around careers in construction, a large focus is on highlighting the range of occupational opportunities which exist across the sector.  </p><p>The Department is also working with colleagues both in SOLAS, the HEA and other Government Departments to deliver an appropriate response to existing projections of skills needs in the construction sector. We expect to publish a report and corresponding tertiary action plan on how to address these needs shortly.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions and as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>I might add that Impact 2030, Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy prioritises the nurturing and development of talent and excellence to build on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an Island of Talent and a location for research excellence and impact. The strategy recognises that the quality of our researchers is fundamental to the quality of our research system, its collaboration with partners in industry and policymakers, both in Ireland and abroad. The strategy also highlights the need to foster an environment within the research and innovation community that supports our ambition to be an Island of Inclusion and Engagement.  </p></reply>

The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skills needs in a manner that presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike. Despite the challenges of Covid, significant progress has been made to date. </p><p>Just this week I was in Drogheda for the announcement of the Drogheda Training Hub. LMETB, working in partnership with employers, industry partners, and SOLAS have successfully secured support and permission for this innovative response to address the urgent need for craft apprentices in the construction and industrial sectors. The proposal will allow for a significant expansion of apprenticeship training in the Louth Meath area in key craft areas such as electrical trades.  <i></i></p><p>In its Training Centre in Dundalk, LMETB provides Craft Apprenticeship Programmes in all craft areas including Pipe Fitting at Phase 4, as well as apprenticeship programmes in Electrical, Motor, Carpentry and Joinery, Metal Fabrication, and Plumbing.</p><p>In response to Government initiatives and political imperative in the area of construction, LMETB has increased the frequency and number of electrical apprenticeship programmes doubling the capacity of the centre and using all existing space available.  By extension of this work, the securing of premises in Drogheda to provide for an additional eight electrical programmes running continuously throughout the year will contribute greatly in the need to address the requirements of the sector.  </p><p>We are delivering a training facility wholly dedicated to electrical apprentices. When fitted out, it will provide a state of the art training centre and help to alleviate the delays faced by apprentices in what is an enduringly popular profession. </p><p>I am particularly pleased to see progress being made in qualifying more electricians- they have an important contribution to make in our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. When operational, this facility will ensure a meaningful contribution to one of the greatest cross-generational challenges facing our society. </p><p>As well as climate targets, the facility will make a valuable contribution to the availability of skilled workers in the construction industry, helping to achieve the ambition set out in <i>Housing for All</i>. </p><p>At a local level, having over 300 apprentices attending the facility will be a huge boost for the area&rsquo;s economy. It will help to support businesses and job creation here in Drogheda and the surrounding area, as the apprentices will need to avail of accommodation, services, and hospitality. </p><p>This represents a tangible demonstration of the desire and the will of Government to work to address the skills challenges of our time, and to support balanced regional development. </p><p>With this week&rsquo;s announcement for Drogheda and LMETB, I can assure Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd that the North-East occupies a strong position in the transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s apprenticeship system, now and into the future. </p></reply>

The Office also keeps the High-Level Steering Board on Policing Reform, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, apprised of progress being made. In addition, progress is reported to the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, which I chair. </p><p><i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>has been broken down in to four stages of implementation, namely:</p><p>1. The <i>Building Blocks</i>Phase;</p><p>2. The <i>Launching Phase</i>;</p><p>3. The <i>Scaling</i>Phase; and</p><p>4. The <i>Consolidation</i>Phase.</p><p>The first three phases of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>have been completed and much has been achieved. For example:</p><p>-  The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide is underway;</p><p>-  The recruitment of nearly 1800 garda staff which has supported the reassignment of many gardai to frontline policing duties;</p><p>-  Roll-out of over 5000 digital communication devices enabling front-line gardai to perform their duties without returning to stations;</p><p>-  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;</p><p>-  Local Community Safety Partnership Pilots have been established in three locations around the country, in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford City and County and Longford County; </p><p>-  T  he development by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement, and Action Plan 2020-2021; and</p><p>-  launch of a three-year Garda Health and Wellbeing Strategy, which will see the introduction of additional health and wellbeing supports.</p><p>There has also been progress on legislative reform. The Government has approved the drafting of:</p><p>-  the landmark Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill which provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation; </p><p>-  the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill, which concerns the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras); and</p><p>-  the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill which brings together and modernises police powers of search, arrest and detention.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Functions and Operational Area) Act 2022, which will facilitate the roll out of the new operating model, was brought into law earlier this year.</p><p>The future focus of the Programme for the final or <i>Consolidation Phase</i>will be on several key organisational and corporate enablers to assist in achieving a sustainable transformation of policing. </p><p>This includes areas such as IT, HR and finance, which are key enablers across the entire reform programme, as well the necessary legislation, Operating Model, Community Safety and Non-Core Duties.</p></reply>

At the time of the adoption of the Decision, there was no consensus among the Members to cover also COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. </p>  <p>  As a compromise, paragraph 8 of the Decision stipulates that no later than six months from the date of that Decision (17 December 2022), Members will be expected to decide on whether to extend the Decision to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>  <p>  Trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, and accordingly the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  The EU is in the process of conducting internal consultations and analysis on the extension, taking into consideration that the case for COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is more complex than the one pertaining to vaccines. </p>  <p>  Discussions on the extension of the mechanism to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are ongoing in the WTO and the EU is engaging constructively in these discussions.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other Member States on the EU position.  A decision to extend the earlier Ministerial Decision from June 2022 will require the agreement of all WTO Members. </p></reply>

The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent, statutory body under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for achieving compliance with employment law in the State. The functions of the WRC include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an employee has not been paid all the wages they are owed, the disputed sum may be considered a 'deduction' under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, and the impacted employee could bring a claim before the WRC. Complaints under the Act may be made using the online complaint form on the WRC's website which can be accessed at Making a Complaint - Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  The WRC also provides a telephone information service. This service is manned by experienced WRC information officers and may be accessed at 059 917 8990 or 0818 80 80 90.

It provides instead for more complete information on the essential aspects of the work to be received by the worker in writing at the beginning of the employment relationship. It also includes a new chapter on minimum requirements relating to working conditions providing completely new material rights for the workers in the European Union.  The Directive will be transposed in Ireland by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of new elements introduced by this Directive that are legally complex. This has prolonged the drafting process and as a consequence, the deadline for transposition of 1st August was not met. However, it is important to note that Ireland pre-empted many provisions of the Directive with the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018. </p>  <p>  The 2018 Act has already introduced anti-penalisation provisions, stronger penalties for non-compliance, restriction of zero hours contracts and the provision of more precise information on hours of work and other core terms of employment to employees at an earlier stage in the employment relationship. </p>  <p>  My officials are intensively engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that transposing Regulations can be finalised at the earliest opportunity possible this year.</p></reply>

In addition, I also released a further 1,000 General Employment Permits for horticulture operatives, 500 for meat deboners, and 1,500 for meat processing operatives.</p>  <p>  All Agriculture quotas were opened with a proviso that a strategic review on labour attraction and retention in the sector is carried out in order to put in place more sustainable solutions for meeting the labour needs of the sector into the future.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility for agriculture and the related food industry is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Following the implementation of an internal plan of action which increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications, the Employment Permits Unit of the Department has reduced the number of applications awaiting processing from about 11,000 in January 2022 to about 1,942 today, despite further strong demand in 2022.

Currently we have 6.1K files (95 Gigabytes) stored in OneDrive and 4.4K files (15.1 Gigabytes) stored in Sharepoint online.    The Department also utilises ESRI's web-based mapping software ArcGIS Online (AGOL) to partially store data in the cloud on ArcGIS Online, a cloud based WebGIS instance by way of hosted services of DECC and GSI collectively.  DECC data is stored on a US Data Cloud Store (dcenr.maps.arcgis.com); GSI data is on European Cloud Store (geodata-gov-ie.maps.arcgis.com/). Collectively for these two instances there is 40GB of data stored on Cloud Storage. There is no personal or sensitive information contained within these servers. All other data is stored and maintained on Departmental SAN (Storage Area Network) storage.</p>  <p>  As the economic, security and governance issues associated with cloud storage evolve, my Department will continue to evaluate the relative merits of cloud and on-premises storage of data when making data storage decisions.</p></reply>

Grant levels for both are up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 and are available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In relation to grants specifically for battery units purchased with Solar PV systems, the SEAI undertook an assessment of incorporating stand-alone battery grants into the new MSS Solar PV Grants and found that with the current high cost of batteries, coupled with their low storage capabilities of only a few hours and their relatively short lifetime (currently in the region of 10 years); that a stand-alone battery grant did not represent efficient use of Exchequer funds. </p><p>It should be noted that micro-generation installations including battery storage systems are still eligible for grant support under the MSS but there is now no need to install a battery to avail of the maximum grant. </p><p>Moreover, maximising the consumption of self-generated electricity by installing a micro-generation system to meet the demand profile of your home or business, where possible, will provide the most benefit to offset rising electricity costs.

In February this year, Government approved the establishment of the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme (NHEUS) Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard.  This Scheme introduces a new, highly customer centric, way to undertake home upgrades. </p><p>Following Government approval, the SEAI registration portal opened for companies to apply to be a One-Stop-Shop (OSS), building on the preparatory work already undertaken. SEAI are focused on engaging organisations capable of professionally managing all aspects of a One Stop Shop service. Therefore, the registration process, for this new service, must be robust. The new Scheme is also grounded in robust governance and oversight processes to ensure the OSSs are meeting the necessary customer and quality performance indicators. </p><p>There are 12 OSSs registered and SEAI is supporting another 10 organisations through the registration process. The SEAI expects to have 15 registered OSSs offering whole house retrofits by the end of this year. SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance.  </p><p>The cost of deep retrofit works to bring an individual home to a Building Energy Rating (BER) B2 is determined by a number of factors including the size and type of home as well as the starting condition of the home. The types of works applied for and the grant support available under the Scheme are informed by the Home Energy Assessment undertaken by the OSS. </p><p>Recent figures from the SEAI estimates that the cost of an OSS deep home retrofit ranges from &euro;12,600 to &euro;79,000 with a reported average total cost figure of &euro;29,000 for completed works to date. While the average OSS home energy grant offer is &euro;20,500. However, it is important to note that these averages may fluctuate depending on the applications submitted to the SEAI.</p><p>Applications for grant funding under the NHEUS take the form of a two-step process where the OSS apply on behalf of the homeowner for (1) a Home Energy Assessment grant and/ or and (2) a Home Energy Upgrade works grant for eligible measures required to bring the home to a B2 BER or better and achieve a primary energy uplift of 100 kWh/m&sup2;/yr. </p><p>The OSS is required to secure the consent of the homeowner before applying for a HEA or NHEUS grant. The HEA and the associated grant being separate to the home energy upgrade supports, means that the OSS will enter into separate contracts with homeowners at the two points of the process. These contracts will respectively provide that the OSS (i) complete the Home Energy Assessment within 12 months from the date the HEA grant offer issues and (ii) complete all home energy upgrade works associated with a property within 12 months of date of the grant offer.</p><p>Most recent figures from SEAI show that 681 homes have been approved for OSS home energy upgrades. The breakdown of this figure on a county basis can be found in the below table. This points to a strong pipeline of works for the coming months under the scheme. To date, energy upgrade works have been completed and paid for 89 homes.</p><p><b>Applications approved for deep home retrofit SEAI grant-aid under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme (One-Stop-Shops)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>County</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co.

Solar PV panels are installed under a number of scenarios. Firstly, Solar PV is installed on new homes, as one of the measures to achieve compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations. These panels are not eligible for Government supports. Secondly, Solar PV panels are installed on existing buildings through grant supports offered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p><p>Since 2018, the SEAI has supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 14,000 homes and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that grant applications will exceed 12,600 in 2022 alone. Since the introduction of the MSS domestic grant in early 2022 applications levels are up 250% year on year. For 2023, the SEAI is forecasting to support over 12,500 homes and over 1,000 small businesses and community organisations.  </p><p>In addition to the MSS offering grant support to domestic and non-domestic applicants for renewable installations up to 6kW, these applicants will also be eligible to avail of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff. As such, any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises of these microgenerators is now eligible for an export payment; which further supports the investment. </p></reply>

The first phase of the scheme, consisting of a Domestic solar PV grant, commenced on the 16th February 2022. The second phase of the scheme, announced on 22nd September, sees Solar PV grants being extended to the non-domestic sector, for installations up to and including 6 kW. Grants are administered by SEAI and are up to a maximum of &euro;2,400. </p><p>This new phase of the scheme provides an opportunity for small businesses, farms and community groups to not only reduce their electricity bills but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals. Moreover, with the recent introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises of these microgenerators is now eligible for an export payment; which further supports the investment. </p><p>The final phase of the MSS will involve the introduction of a Clean Export Premium (CEP) feed-in tariff, to support non-domestic applicants for installation sizes greater than 6kWp up to 50kWp. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will consult on an implementation plan for the CEP tariff, which will consist of a guaranteed export tariff support for new installations, that is fixed for 15 years. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generation (above 50kW). This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition. The design of the scheme is being progressed, with a public consultation process closing last week, on 13th October. The scheme is expected to become available in 2023. </p></reply>

The key benefit of micro-generation is the money you save on your electricity bill by consuming some of your own power, especially as we see rising electricity bills as a result of the war in Ukraine. </p><p>I signed the Regulations that provide for the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) on the 15th February this year and since then the necessary implementation work has been completed by ESB Networks and suppliers, under the guidance of the CRU, to deliver this benefit to micro-generators. </p><p>The CRU published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for its implementation, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. </p><p>I am aware that while all suppliers have now advertised their rates, not all suppliers have made initial payments. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial CEG payments will be made at the earliest opportunity. However, it is important to note that microgenerators will not lose out, as payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022 (the date the regulations were enacted), whichever is the latest. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them to raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The Study considered a number of potential decarbonisation options for a wide range of dwelling and business types. This included the use of liquid biofuels, solid biomass, biogases, and other technologies such as heat pumps and district heating networks. The Study finds that heat pumps play a significant role in decarbonising heat. The recommendation of the Study is that heat pumps are the correct decarbonisation path for domestic heating systems, with district heating also being a competitive option that can be widely deployed.    Furthermore, in line with the recent agreement on Sectoral Emissions Ceilings to deliver up to 5.7 TWh of biomethane to further accelerate the reduction of overall economy-wide emissions, an obligation on the heat sector to include renewable heat will be introduced by 2024. The introduction of this Obligation will incentivise the use of renewable heat, while spreading the obligation across all non-renewable fuel types. A technical consultation will soon be undertaken, to directly inform the design of a Renewable Heat Obligation.`</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-18a.388.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101800078#WRL02700"><p>The Ukraine crisis and matters arising from it continue to adversely affect European and Global oil markets, causing a sustained increase in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p><p>The Government recognises the important role the haulage sector plays in supporting the economy and is fully aware of cost pressures on haulage businesses arising from high fuel prices in particular since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. </p><p>The Government has put in place several measures to ease these cost pressures:</p><p>- On 10 March 2022, in direct response to the crisis in Ukraine, the Government introduced an <b>Excise duty reduction</b>of 15 cent per litre of diesel. This has now been extended to 28 February 2023.</p><p>- On 15 March 2022, the Government introduced the <b>Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme</b>. The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport and provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. There was good uptake of the scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to c. 3,080 operators (approx. 80% of licensed operators.)</p><p>- The <b>Revenue Diesel Rebate Scheme (&lsquo;DRS&rsquo;)</b>has been in place since 2013 and remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. Data from the Revenue Commissioners shows that not all licensed operators currently avail of this support &ndash; I would encourage all eligible operators to do so.</p><p>- The rising cost of fuel was further recognised by the Government in the Budget through the reduction of the <b>National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) Levy</b>to zero. The reduction of the NORA levy, which had been collected at a rate of 2 cent per litre, will help offset the carbon tax increase of just over 2 cent which took effect on 12 October, meaning that the price of fuel will not go up as a result of taxes or levies.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p><p>Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.</p><p>The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases.</p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department of Transport and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to enable owners of small public service vehicles, such as taxis, hackneys and limousines, to buy electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the terms and conditions of the eSPSV grant scheme, applicants may be granted one extension for a three-month period in which to complete and finalise their application.  Given the difficulties in obtaining vehicles, extensions have been granted on a case by cases basis, but only up to three months; and where proof is provided that a vehicle is on order and the date it will become available. No further extensions are available after this time period on the original application. If the application process is timed out an individual is able to reapply to the scheme and will be considered a new applicant for the purpose of the scheme. No extensions will be granted past 2022. Applicants can apply under the new scheme in 2023. </p>  <p>Queries on individual cases should be directed to the NTA as the scheme administrators.  </p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March.</p>  <p>  The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 195,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication later this year.</p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. I am deeply cognisant of the need to facilitate residents without a driveway to charge their EV at a reasonable cost within their neighbourhood.  </p>  <p>  On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles. A suite of new of grants and initiatives have been announced including the development of a new residential charging grant which will focus on providing neighbourhood and residential charging solutions, targeting areas where residents do not have access to off street parking and a home charger . </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are liaising closely with the Local Government Management Agency on plans to deliver charging solutions to these types of neighbourhoods. </p></reply>

The SMP sets out a framework for active travel and public transport to support Ireland&rsquo;s overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and seeks to ensure that the development of active travel and public transport infrastructure are fully integrated.  As part of this integrated approach, the existing commitment in the Programme for Government to establish a National Public Transport Forum was incorporated into the National Sustainable Mobility Policy as a commitment to convene a National Sustainable Mobility Forum to engage with all stakeholders on progress in relation to the SMP. </p><p>A further commitment in the SMP was the establishment of a Leadership Group to oversee implementation of the policy and delivery of its Action Plan. The intention of this Leadership Group is that the National Sustainable Mobility Forum, which it intends to hold on an annual basis, will provide an opportunity for regular engagement and interaction with a wide range of stakeholders, and that this Forum will be a crucial mechanism to ensure that implementation of the SMP is progressed on schedule. The Department of Transport intends to convene the first National Sustainable Mobility Forum in Q2 2023 to coincide with the first anniversary of the launch of the SMP. This will be an opportune moment to take stock of progress made during the SMP's first year, as well as to look towards the next steps required to deliver on the SMP&rsquo;s core objective of achieving an additional 500,000 daily active travel and public transport journeys and a 10% reduction in kilometres driven by fossil-fuelled cars by 2030.  <i></i></p></reply>

As a consequence, the number of permanent driver testers employed by the RSA was recommended to be raised from 100 to 130. My Department approved this request and following the recruitment process it is expected that additional testers will commence work by year end.</p>  <p>   As the operation of the national driving test service is the statutory responsibility of the RSA information on the driving test waiting times in the County Meath area is held by the Authority.  I have therefore referred this part of the question to the RSA for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p></reply>

In addition, the object of the scholarship must be the promotion of the education of the holder rather than the promotion of research through the holder. For the scholarship exemption to apply, there must be no element of service (directly or indirectly) between the sponsor and the student, and the award must not arise from an office or employment (directly or indirectly) with the sponsor.</p>  <p>  Revenue also advises that fellowships are generally regarded as being distinct from a scholarship. Students, for example post-doctoral students, who have a salaried position in order to provide research services are not considered to be under full time instruction. In such cases, the scholarship exemption does not apply, and PAYE must be operated by the payer. Further details in relation to the scholarship exemption can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-26.pdf</p>  <p>  Finally, in the case of stipends to participants in the Innovate for Ireland programme, Revenue advises that in order for the exemption from tax, USC and PRSI to apply, it will be necessary for the students to meet the conditions set out in section 193 TCA 1997. Otherwise, the stipends will be taxable in full.</p></reply>

Properties commonly referred to as &ldquo;NAMA properties&rdquo; are in fact owned by private entities  who are &ldquo;NAMA debtors&rdquo;. The management and maintenance of any NAMA-secured property remains the responsibility of the NAMA debtors.

Data for 2020 should be available in Q4 of this year, while data for 2021 will only be available next year once the returns for 2021 are received, processed and the relevant figures compiled.</p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that the liability associated with the 3% surcharge on non-PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000 amounted to &euro;71 million and &euro;65 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.  </p><p>The origins of the 3% USC surcharge that applies on non-PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum, go back to Budget 2011 and Finance Act 2011 when the USC was first introduced.  </p><p>Against the background of difficult decisions at the time to address problems associated with the public finances, the 3% USC surcharge was introduced to ensure that the relative position as regards the top marginal tax rates for PAYE income earners (52%) and self-employed income earners (55%) remained unchanged when compared with the position before Budget 2011.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government states that the 3% USC surcharge applied to self-employed income is unfair and it contains a commitment that proposals will be considered to ameliorate this over time as resources allow.</p><p>However, as the Deputy will appreciate, having regard to current cost of living pressures which impact on low income earners the hardest, it would not be appropriate to seek to address the USC surcharge issue at this time.</p><p>It is also important to note that abolishing or reducing the USC surcharge on non-PAYE income would result in a reduction in the overall tax yield, thus potentially raising the question of an alternative revenue stream. </p></reply>

An IREF is an investment undertaking, or a sub-fund, which derives 25% or more of its market value (either directly or indirectly) from real estate assets in the State.  IREFs are not subject to dividend withholding tax, they are subject to an IREF Withholding Tax (WHT) of 20% on distributions to non-resident investors. The legislative provisions exempt certain categories of non-resident investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings from having IREF withholding tax applied in circumstances where the appropriate declarations are in place.</p><p>Irish resident investors are generally subject to a separate investment undertaking tax, at a rate of 41% for individuals and 25% for companies, on distributions received from the fund.  </p><p>In addition to a 20% IREF WHT on distributions, the Finance Act 2019 introduced a charge to income tax at the rate of 20% at the level of the IREF to counter the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits. The three anti-avoidance measures introduced in 2019 included <i>(i)</i>a debt cap, to limit excessive leveraging and resulting interest, <i>(ii)</i>a property financing cost ratio, to limit excessive interest rates, and <i>(iii)</i>a &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; test to limit excessive expenses.  </p><p>IREF WHT applies on the happening of an &ldquo;IREF taxable event&rdquo; which is essentially the passing of value or profits to the unitholder. The operating and pre-tax profits of an IREF will include both realised and unrealised amounts (such as increases in the value of property held by the IREF). Therefore, it is not meaningful to compare the amount of tax arising on the transfer of profits to investors with the accounting profits of an IREF. Where profits remain in the fund, either because they are gains that are recorded in the accounts but not yet realised or because they are being reinvested in Irish property, a charge to IREF WHT does not apply. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above limitations, I have set out for the Deputy the operating and pre-tax profits* on the financial statements respectively in each of the years 2018 to 2020 in Table 1. In 2020, IREFs reported an operating loss of approximately &euro;440 million and Revenue is in the process of establishing the nature of these losses. </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; IREF Operating Profit and Profit Before Tax Figures* as per IREF Financial Statements</b></p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018&euro; </th>       <th>2019&euro; </th>       <th>2020**&euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Operating Profit (Loss) </td>       <td>867,739,813 </td>       <td>1,159,450,861 </td>       <td>(440,534,785) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit/(Loss) Before Tax </td>       <td>498,299,253 </td>       <td>724,795,840 </td>       <td>(636,974,897) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF WHT Deducted/Paid </td>       <td>28,229,097</td>       <td>65,759,048 </td>       <td>36,789,897 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Income Tax Paid </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>6,283,824 </td>       <td>17,023,498 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Tax Paid </td>       <td>28,299,097 </td>       <td>72,042,872 </td>       <td>53,813,396 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*I am advised by Revenue that the profit amounts set out in Table 1 are provided for indicative purposes only and are subject to caveats. For example, there can be inconsistencies in how the figures are reported and in some cases the figures have been netted. There can also be inconsistency in the length of the financial periods, with some in excess of 12 months. This was evident last year where a number of IREFs sought derogations from the Central Bank of Ireland to prepare 18-month set of accounts for 2020 due to the impact caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>**This data is derived from the Financial Statements submitted to Revenue.

The cost to the Exchequer of the scheme, (excluding Motor Tax) was &euro;62 million in 2021 and is currently at &euro;59m Y.T.D., reflecting reductions in fuel grant claims arising from COVID-19 travel restrictions within Ireland. The cost of the scheme in 2023 is expected to be similar to that of previous years. The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations. In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the six medical criteria. </p>  <p>  In relation to the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme, as the Deputy will be aware, I gave a commitment to the Dail that such a review including a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.</p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  We consider this the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both this Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, has held a number of meetings this year and have completed a stock-taking exercise of existing transport and mobility schemes currently supporting people with disabilities. At the next meeting of the Transport Working Group in November, proposals for next steps from all members (including the Department of Finance, agencies and stakeholders) will be considered to complete the work required under the NDIS.</p>  <p>  As part of its contribution to the NDIS review, my Department established an information-gathering group to capture the experiences, expertise and perspectives of former Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA)  members and Principal Medical Officers (PMOs) in the HSE. A range of outputs have been produced, providing information and views on the DDS scheme as inputs into the broader review.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to engage constructively with the NDIS review with a view to assisting in bringing forward proposals for Government to consider.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any potential changes to the scheme in advance of these proposals.</p></reply>

These are timing changes and do not affect the quantum of credit that a company is entitled to claim. As a result, the changes are net neutral in budgetary terms.</p><p>- The current system which offset the R&amp;amp;D tax credit against corporation tax liabilities and the payment in three payable instalments is being changed to a new fixed three-year payment system.</p><p>- A company will have an option to call for payment of their eligible R&amp;amp;D tax credit or to request for it to be offset against other tax liabilities.</p><p>- Existing caps on the payable element of the credit are being removed.</p><p>- The first &euro;25,000 of a claim will now be payable in full, to provide a cash-flow benefit for smaller R&amp;amp;D projects and encourage more companies to engage with the regime. </p><p>Transitional measures will be in place for one year, to smooth the transition to the new payment system for companies that are already engaged in research &amp;amp; development activities.</p><p>The R&amp;amp;D tax credit is repayable only in respect of eligible R&amp;amp;D expenditure which is covered under the existing R&amp;amp;D legislative framework. </p><p>There is no scope to introduce an income tax refundable tax credit without legislative amendments. Furthermore, there are no current plans to introduce a system of refundable income tax credits. </p><p>The matter of refundable tax credits was looked at in some detail in 2002 by the Working Group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Group was chaired by the Department of Finance and included representatives from ICTU, IBEC, the various farming organisations, the Community and Voluntary Pillar, relevant Government Departments and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Notwithstanding the passage of time, many of the findings and conclusions identified by the Working Group remain relevant and valid today.</p><p>The Working Group found that there were significant disadvantages with such a system.  These included the potential negative impacts on the incentive to work, labour supply, labour force participation and overall productivity and output. Refundable tax credits may not be consistent with the objective of encouraging as many people as possible to join or remain in the workforce.  In addition, I would note that the minimum wage has been increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;11.30 per hour, between 2016 and 2023 in an effort to support those on lower incomes. </p><p>The Commission on Welfare and Taxation recently considered the issue of refundable tax credits, noting that the 2009 Commission on Taxation concluded against the introduction of refundable tax credits as did the 2012 Advisory Group on Taxation and Welfare. The Commission report states &ldquo;<i>the costs of introducing a system of refundable tax credits renders it prohibitively expensive and counter to the Commission net revenue-raising approach</i>&rdquo;. Further details can be found in the Commission&rsquo;s report-  www.gov.ie/en/publication/7fbeb-report-of-the-commission/.</p></reply>

Further detail on this measure will be made available on the publication of the Finance Bill later this week.</p>  <p>  The introduction of this tax follows from my Department's commitment under Housing for All to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 facilitated the collection on data on vacant property through LPT returns.</p>  <p>  A preliminary analysis of the vacancy data was published by Revenue in July this year, following the LPT revaluation in November 2021, and can be found at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/lpt/lpt-vacant-properties-report.pdf.</p>  <p>  In arriving at the estimates for the Budget documentation, certain assumptions were made based on the Revenue data and took into account the number of long-term vacant properties (those unoccupied for greater than 12 months), their valuation band, as well as their reasons for lying vacant which may correspond with an exemption from the tax. It is tentatively estimated that less than 15% of the total properties reported as vacant may be in scope of the tax.</p>  <p>  The preliminary analysis published by Revenue also gives the distribution of vacant properties by valuation band which suggests the distribution is broadly similar to that of properties that are liable for LPT and is likely to be reflected in the average amount of the tax paid. That said, the VHT payable will depend on the self-assessed returns submitted by property owners, the number of properties declared as liable and the number of property owners entitled to claim exemption from the tax. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the legislation providing for the VHT will include a number of provisions designed to encourage compliance with the VHT and identify non-compliance. As outlined, the details will be published shortly in the Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  As stated in my Budget speech, this measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand, rather than raise revenue The estimated yield is low, as I anticipate this tax will influence behaviour and lead to property owners putting their vacant properties to more effective use. As such, the number of properties that will be subject to this tax and the eventual yield may be lower than the estimates provided.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank have a role in setting the rates that mortgage creditors charge on their loans or in relation to the particular mortgage products that they provide to borrowers.<i></i></p><p>In relation to the regulatory aspects of the provision and operation of mortgage contracts, the Central Bank has put in place a range of measures in order to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage under its Consumer Protection Framework and which seeks to ensure that lenders are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle, for example, through protections at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties. The requirements put in place by the Central Bank complement the European legislative framework, including the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016.</p><p>Where a loan is sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the regulatory protections that were available to borrowers prior to the transaction continue to be in place with the new owner. It is worth noting that under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 if a loan is transferred or sold, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be regulated and must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers whose loans are sold or transferred maintain the same regulatory protections that they had, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013.</p><p>The Central Bank has also stated that it expects all regulated entities to take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers (existing and new) and communicate clearly, effectively, and in a timely manner with all customers.</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. It is important to note that both components of MOT are excise. </p><p>In accordance with the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act, 2010, VAT is chargeable on petrol and auto-diesel at the standard rate, currently 23%, on the total amount which the supplier is entitled to receive including taxes, duties, levies and charges but excluding the VAT itself. A levy is also charged on petrol and diesel to cover the costs related to maintaining security of oil supplies. While both MOT and VAT are administered by Revenue the levy is administered by, and paid directly to, the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA). At Budget 2023, I announced a reduction in the NORA to help offset increases in MOT carbon component rates, which came into effect on October 12th. The NORA levy currently remains at 2c/litre but its reduction to 0.01c/litre will be backdated to 12th October. The reduction does not impact directly on MOT rates, rather its offsetting effect will be on the pump price of relevant fuels. My colleague Eamonn Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, is working with his Department and NORA to implement changes to the NORA levy. </p><p>The current MOT rates applying to petrol and auto-diesel are &euro;483.34 and &euro;425.45 per 1,000 litres respectively. Diesel used for certain purposes, for example in agricultural machinery, may qualify for a reduced rate of MOT. Such diesel must be marked with prescribed fiscal markers and is referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or farm/agricultural diesel. A reduced VAT rate, currently 13.5% applies to MGO. The reduced rate of MOT that applies to MGO is currently &euro;111.14 per 1,000 litres. Current MOT rates are published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/excise/excise-duty-rates/budget-excise-duty-rates.pdf.</p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of the taxes and levies applying to petrol, auto-diesel and MGO. Average retail prices are as per the EC Weekly Oil Bulletin of 13 October 2022 which uses prices based sourced on 10 October 2022 (prior to the carbon tax increase on 12<sup>th</sup>October 2022).  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Petrol </th>       <th>% of retail price </th>       <th>Auto-diesel </th>       <th>% of retail price </th>       <th>MGO </th>       <th>% of retail price </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;/litre </td>       <td>&euro;/litre </td>       <td>&euro;/litre </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre tax </td>       <td>&euro;0.94 </td>       <td>54% </td>       <td>&euro;1.09 </td>       <td>58% </td>       <td>&euro;1.04 </td>       <td>78% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nora levy </td>       <td>&euro;0.02 </td>       <td>1% </td>       <td>&euro;0.02 </td>       <td>1% </td>       <td>&euro;0.02 </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MOT non-carbon </td>       <td>&euro;0.37 </td>       <td>21% </td>       <td>&euro;0.30 </td>       <td>16% </td>       <td>&euro;0.00 </td>       <td>0% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MOT carbon </td>       <td>&euro;0.09 </td>       <td>5% </td>       <td>&euro;0.11 </td>       <td>6% </td>       <td>&euro;0.11 </td>       <td>8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total MOT </td>       <td>&euro;0.47 </td>       <td>27% </td>       <td>&euro;0.41 </td>       <td>22% </td>       <td>&euro;0.11 </td>       <td>8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>VAT </td>       <td>&euro;0.33 </td>       <td>19% </td>       <td>&euro;0.35 </td>       <td>19% </td>       <td>&euro;0.16 </td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Tax &amp;amp; NORA levy </td>       <td>&euro;0.81 </td>       <td>46% </td>       <td>&euro;0.78 </td>       <td>42% </td>       <td>&euro;0.29 </td>       <td>22% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Retail Price </td>       <td>&euro;1.75 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;1.87 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;1.33 </td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Rounding applies eg.

These are Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Customs Duty.</p><p><b>1. VRT</b></p><p>For the purposes of this reply, we will assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question is in relation to Category A vehicles, the VRT category into which cars for everyday family use normally fall into. The origin of the car has no implication whatsoever for VRT calculations. </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that the VRT calculation on passenger vehicles is based on the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) of the vehicle and its emissions levels.</p><p>In the case of a second-hand imported passenger vehicle, the OMSP is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, for which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the vehicle might reasonably be expected to sell in an arm&rsquo;s length sale in the State by a retailer.</p><p>The amount of VRT on a passenger vehicle has two components, based on the vehicle&rsquo;s carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission levels. The CO<sub>2</sub>component of the VRT charge is a percentage of the vehicle&rsquo;s OMSP, ranging from 7% for a vehicle which has zero CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, up to 41% of the OMSP for vehicles with the highest emission levels. The NOx component of VRT is calculated using a progressive scale, starting from &euro;5 and rising to &euro;25 per mg/km of the vehicle&rsquo;s NOx emissions level. As a result of these calculations, the total VRT charge grows higher according to the emissions output of the vehicle involved and its market value.</p><p><b>2. VAT </b></p><p>A vehicle may be subject to VAT. Vehicles first registered in Great Britain (GB), and subsequently registered in NI after 31 December 2020, will be subject to VAT at a rate of 23% of the customs value of the vehicle (the cost price plus the costs of transport and insurance) before it may be registered in the State. If it can be shown that a vehicle has remained in Northern Ireland since first registration, or was in Northern Ireland prior to 31 December 2020, VAT will not apply as Northern Ireland remains within the European Union&rsquo;s (EU) VAT regime.</p><p><b>3. Customs Duty</b></p><p>Cars purchased from Northern Ireland are not normally subject to customs formalities including declarations or payment of customs duty. However, proof will be required to be provided to Revenue to show that the vehicle was brought into Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021, or, in the case of vehicles imported to Northern Ireland after 1 January 2021, proof that the customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland. </p><p>A vehicle first registered in NI after 1 January 2021 can be registered in the State without providing proof of its customs status where it meets the following conditions:</p><p>- the registration in NI was the first registration of the vehicle in the United Kingdom (UK)</p><p>and</p><p>- the vehicle has never been exported and, or re-registered in, Great Britain or any other country outside the European Union.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the Revenue website at the following link: revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/registration-of-imported-used-vehicles/index.aspx. </p></reply>

Through its consumer protection role, the Central Bank sets out requirements in its codes of conduct which detail how regulated firms such as banks should deal with and treat their customers.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA) places a requirement on regulated entities to have fair and transparent processes in place to deal with borrowers in, or facing, mortgage arrears and it sets out the process that entities must follow when a borrower is experiencing repayment difficulty. Due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations.</p>  <p>  Entities must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) offered in order to determine which ARA, if any, is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.  The CCMA also provides for an appeals mechanism, including where the entity declines to offer an ARA, where the borrower is not willing to enter into an ARA offered, or where the entity classifies the borrower as not co-operating.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank does not have remit over commercial decisions of the entities it regulates. The nature of lender forbearance measures can vary and remain a decision for the individual institution, based on the individual circumstances of borrowers.  However, the Central Bank has stated that it encourages borrowers to engage as early as possible with their lenders and to provide the information required to enable an assessment of the individual circumstances commence.</p></reply>

The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) introduced strong security requirements for the initiation and processing of electronic payments, which apply to all payment service providers. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.</p>  <p>  Under PSD2 payment service providers are obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. SCA is a combination of something you know (a password or PIN), something you have (a card reader or token generator) and something you are (a fingerprint).</p>  <p>  The European Commission are currently undertaking a review of PSD2, which is expected to cover a wide variety of areas related to the Directive. Officials from my Department have been engaging with the Commission&rsquo;s review on areas of Irish interest, including strong customer authentication. It is likely that when the review is complete the Commission will bring forward a proposal for a new Directive (PSD3) early in the new year. </p></reply>

The scheme closed with effect from 31 May 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, eligibility to EWSS is based on the employer demonstrating that its business is likely to experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders during a specific reference period and that this disruption to business is caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the business must also have tax clearance.  </p>  <p>  To qualify for the scheme as a New Business, an employer must have commenced to trade after 1 November 2019. I am advised by Revenue that the question of whether a business is commencing or is the continuation of an existing business is determined by the facts of each individual case. A substantial body of existing case law, in the wider tax context, exists on this issue and certain principles have been established. These established principles include whether the management and control, employees, activities, customer base, suppliers, and accounting systems of the business are substantially the same following any change in activity. I am advised by Revenue that, in this case, the employer registered and applied for the scheme as a New Business. However, on examination, Revenue considered that the business of the employer existed prior to 1 November 2019 and as such, actual turnover for 2019, i.e., 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, instead of projections, was used to determine eligibility. Based on the information provided, the employer was advised that it did not meet the 30% reduction in turnover criteria and was therefore ineligible for EWSS. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the employer in this case has exercised their rights under Revenue&rsquo;s Complaint and Review Procedure and additional information has been sought from this employer as part of this process. Revenue will consider any additional information provided by the employer which they consider relevant to their claim. </p></reply>

This can be for a number of reasons including where (i) the complaint may be impacted by the outcome of an ongoing statutory appeal or judicial review which arises in a similar matter, (ii) no action is appropriate pending the outcome of the Tracker mortgage Examination Independent Appeals Panel process, (iii) the outcome of external legal proceedings is awaited, or (iv) the hold is at the Complainant&rsquo;s request for personal reasons. </p><p>Of the remaining 973 active tracker mortgage complaints on hand, the detail of their status is listed in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Complaint Stage </th>       <th>Number </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Registration &amp;amp; Initial Assessment </td>       <td>22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dispute Resolution Service (Mediation) </td>       <td>46 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Formal Investigation </td>       <td>251 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Adjudication </td>       <td>638 (This includes 25 where a Preliminary Decision has been issued to the parties, and an additional 145, where the preparation of the preliminary decision is at an advanced stage) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Review </td>       <td>10 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Appeal/Judicial Review </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As of 14 October 2022, there were 302 legally binding decisions relating to tracker mortgage complaints available on the FSPO&rsquo;s Database of Decisions. Of these decisions 11 complaints were upheld; 12 were substantially upheld; 26 were partially upheld; and 253 were not upheld. </p><p>At the time of publication of the Digest of Tracker Mortgage Interest Rate Complaints in February 2020, the FSPO noted that it is likely that it will continue to be the case that a large number of complaints relating to tracker interest rates on mortgage loans will not be upheld, because for a person to have an entitlement to a particular tracker interest rate, there must be some contractual or other obligation on their bank entitling them to such a rate.</p><p>The FSPO has advised me that the data contained in this response is extracted from a live database and therefore depicts complaint information at a specific moment in time. Data in this database is subject to ongoing verification and data categorisation as the understanding of the specific complaint is developed.</p></reply>

It is necessary to summarise the two certification mechanisms to provide a comprehensive reply. </p><p>Prior to Finance Act 2018 a producer company would apply to Revenue for a certificate confirming that the production met the conditions set out for the scheme. The certificate was issued by Revenue, but both Revenue and the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht had specific responsibilities in relation to the certification process. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht had regard for:</p><p>- The categories of film eligible for certification and;</p><p>- The contribution a film would make to either or both the development of the film industry in the State and the promotion and expression of Irish culture.</p><p>Revenue had responsibility for all other aspects of the project, including the financial aspects. Revenue did not issue a certificate unless they had received an authorisation from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that they were satisfied with the other aspects of the application. Therefore pre-Finance Act 2018, an application may have failed to be certified by Revenue or by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>As part of this old claiming mechanism, Revenue examined applications based on budgeted expenditure to certify the value of the initial 90% that could be claimed up-front. Upon completion of the film and receipt of the compliance report, Revenue conducted another full examination of the actual expenditure incurred before certifying the balancing 10% of the claim. This process meant that Revenue adjusted the value of the claim where it was incorrect. In this manner Revenue verified that the amount claimed was correct. Therefore there was no incorrect amount claimed to which interest and penalties could apply. I am advised by Revenue that from January 2016 to March 2019, 320 films applied to Revenue for certification and, of these, 19 did not continue to certification.</p><p>From January 2018 Revenue began tracking the level of ineligible expenditure which was included in the initial claim, but was excluded from the final claim following the examination by Revenue. By the end of May 2019, 75 compliance reports had been reviewed with combined gross eligible expenditure of &euro;218 million, of which &euro;2 million was deemed ineligible. This reduced the related film relief by &euro;0.6 million. Information concerning applications to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in this period is outlined in the table at the end of this reply.</p><p>Finance Act 2018 split the certification process between Revenue and the now Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM). Production companies now claim the tax credit under the self-assessment system. This brings the credit within the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for incorrect claims.</p><p>Production companies must first apply to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for a cultural certificate.  In order to be certified the production must pass &lsquo;the Industry Development test&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Culture test&rsquo;. The requirements to pass these tests are clearly set out in DTCAGSM guidance. Therefore applicants are aware of the criteria which must be adhered to from the outset.</p><p>DTCAGSM perform an in-depth examination of each of the documents which are submitted as part of the application. Applications are assessed by one member of staff in DTCAGSM, reviewed by another member of the Department, and are finally approved at the Principal Officer grade.</p><p>If, at the stage of application for certification, an application does not meet the requirements of the relief, DTCAGSM engage with the production companies to advise as to why the application may have not met the standard required. This engagement can often lead to adjustments in the application.</p><p>For projects with eligible expenditure in excess of &euro;2 million, Screen Ireland engage thoroughly with applicants to ensure they adhere to requirements concerning skills development and training. Any issues are identified and corrected to ensure adherence with the requirements of the relief. Within 6 months of completion of the project, applicants are required to submit a Quality Assurance Compliance Report to Screen Ireland. Evidence of compliance with all conditions is required, including evidence of skills development activity. The quantity of training and the budget expended in this regard should not be less than that which was proposed at application stage.</p><p>In consideration of the importance of Section 481 funding to productions, and the significant conditions attached to the relief, applicants aim to fully comply with these requirements from the outset. As production companies become familiar with the requirements of the relief, the quality of application improves. These factors reduce the number of applications which are rejected outright.</p><p>As stated above, prior to Finance Act 2018 an application had to be approved by both Revenue and DTCAGSM to be eligible for relief. The table below concerns applications to DTCAGSM only, it does not include those which were not certified by Revenue as part of the old certification mechanism. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of applications originally refused by DTCAGSM </th>       <th>No. of applications deemed eligible following engagement by DTCAGSM </th>       <th>Final no. of applications refused by DTCAGSM </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Longford are treated in line with the disposal policy of the Office of Public Works (OPW).</p><p>The OPW policy with regard to non-operational (vacant) State property is to:</p><p>1. Identify if the property is required/suitable for alternative State use by either Government departments or the wider public sector. </p><p>2. If there is no other State use identified for a property, the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate revenue for the Exchequer.</p><p>3. If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW may consider community involvement (subject to detailed written submission, which would indicate that the community/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer).</p><p>When a property is deemed surplus to the requirements of the Commissioners, the OPW notifies all relevant stakeholders as part of the OPW policy on the disposal of surplus assets.  This includes notifying the Land Development Agency and the relevant local authorities who may be interested in acquiring the property for housing purposes.</p><p>In line with the above policy, the OPW has sought alternative State use for the property in Ardagh, Co Longford. To date no State requirement has been identified.  The OPW is therefore proceeding with preparing the property for disposal on the open market during 2023.</p></reply>

The Attorney General has established a working group of planning law experts to assist him with the review and there is ongoing, intensive engagement between the working group and my Department. There is also ongoing engagement with stakeholders from a broad range of sectors, including the public sector, business, environmental, social and knowledge based sectors through the Planning Advisory Forum, which plays an important role in contributing to the emerging policy considerations of the Review.

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i)in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;(ii)in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and(iii)can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant. </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities, including information on social housing acquisitions. This data is available until the end of Quarter 2 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/.</p><p>My Department does not hold data on the occupation status of properties acquired for social housing, and hence do not hold data on the related expenditure on properties acquired for the reasons specified by the Deputy. This information may be available from individual local authorities. </p></reply>

Under the notification procedure, a 90 day standstill period applies to the draft instrument following notification to the Commission to allow for the consideration of any relevant observations/comments received from the European Commission, Member States and other affected stakeholders.</p>  <p>  During the concluding D&aacute;il debate on the Bill on 13 July 2022, I highlighted that both Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill had been notified to the European Commission in order to provide an opportunity for Commission, Member States and other affected stakeholders to make comments or observations on the relevant provisions in the Bill.</p>  <p>  In addition, I stressed that any comments or observations that might arise from the Commission from this formal consultative process could be considered in advance of the commencement of Parts 4 and 5 both of which are subject to commencement orders under section 1(5) of the Act. Now that the standstill periods under notifications 2022/184/IRL and 2022/376/IRL have elapsed, my Department is examining the comments received from the European Commission in response to the TRIS notification procedure. </p></reply>

The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing.  Under Housing for All, my Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required.  The Housing Agency undertook to carry out this analytical exercise on behalf of the Department to better understand what level of discretion should be made available to Local Authorities under HAP to maintain adequate levels of support. </p><p>Following receipt and analysis of this review, I, in cooperation with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have now approved an increase in the HAP discretion rate from 20% to 35% and for new tenancies to extend the couple&rsquo;s rate to single person households. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.  Both these measures came into effect from 11 July 2022.</p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis.  </p><p>I am committed to decreasing our reliance on the HAP scheme and central to that is significantly scaling up our social housing supply.

Significant funding has been secured and is being made available to support delivery of Cost Rental by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Local Authorities and by the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p>  <p>  Delivery will increase incrementally, to an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year. 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026. AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites, or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the objectives of Housing For All, currently under the Affordable Housing Fund, dwellings in schemes with a net density of over 50 dwellings per hectare in cities designated under the National Planning Framework can qualify for funding of up to &euro;100,000 per unit, dwellings in schemes with a net density of over 35 dwellings and under 50 dwellings per hectare can qualify for funding of up to &euro;75,000 per unit, and dwellings in schemes with a net density of less than 35 dwellings per hectare can qualify for funding of up to &euro;50,000 per unit. </p>  <p>  International events have contributed to an increase in the cost of loan co-financing and the trajectory of interest rates which impacts AHB delivery of Cost Rental homes as well as all housing providers. Combined with the ongoing impact of construction cost inflation, the viability of schemes has become more challenging, negatively affecting the required level of cost rent paid by tenants.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, Government has decided that it is appropriate to increase the funding ceilings available per dwelling delivered for both the CREL and AHF schemes. The changes for both schemes will be subject to defined criteria which allows the demonstration of need and the operational parameters for implementation are currently being finalised and will be completed over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 saw the funding allocation for CREL increase from &euro;70m in 2022 to &euro;75m for next year, while funding for Local Authorities through the AHF rose from &euro;60m in 2022 to &euro;90m for 2023. The changes to these two schemes, combined with the increased funding available, will help to address some of the challenges faced by AHBs and Local Authorities in the continued implementation of Cost Rental schemes.  The funding available will help to continue to target rents achievable for Exchequer-supported Cost Rental homes at a minimum discount of 25% below open market rates.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.  </p>  <p>  The Government recognises and appreciates the key role of landlords in providing much needed accommodation. Landlords are essential to a fully functioning residential property market. The Government is committed to supporting the continued participation of landlords and growing their investment in the rental market. It has also been necessary in recent and uncertain times to strengthen tenancy protections for tenants including for reasons of supply and affordability in the sector.</p>  <p>  In term of assisting landlords, it should be noted that the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2023 that he would double the amount of tax deductible pre-letting expenses to &euro;10,000 in respect of properties vacant for at least 6 months (currently, a vacancy for at least 12 months is required to avail of this measure). The Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Finance in relation to financial measures to assist landlords.   </p>  <p>  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2022 are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

In areas where Avian Influenza has already been confirmed, it may not be necessary to collect further birds for sampling. The avian influenza virus is very contagious amongst birds and can survive for several weeks in the environment. The faeces of infected birds contains a high level of virus and so the area can remain infective irrespective of whether bird carcasses are removed from an area or not.

The preliminary programme for the project is based on a planning submission in Q3 2024 with unit delivery subject to a positive planning decision.</p>  <p>  In relation to Sandy Road, the Land Development Agency has advised my Department that it is currently preparing a Framework Masterplan to guide the development at this site. The public lands are currently owned by Galway City Council, Galway County Council and the ESB, with the ESB site identified in Housing for All as a site that will transfer to the Land Development Agency at the appropriate time.

This toolkit recognises that, while the issue of care disproportionately affects women, it also impacts all people who have caring responsibilities. </p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a wide variety of initiatives aimed at promoting the participation of women, inclusion and diversity in local government, through funding research, providing supports to organisations that deliver capacity building and training for women interested in local government, and annual calls for funding geared towards both political parties and local authorities. The latter calls for funding provide investment for innovative and forward-thinking projects which support wider inclusivity and diversity in local government decision-making structures, a number of which were outlined in the NWCI family friendly toolkit, such as workshops, training and information campaigns. This year, my Department expects, for example, to provide funding to Westmeath County Council for a feasibility study which will examine the infrastructure that would facilitate the childcare needs of councillors, along with the feasibility of providing a multi-purpose room and accessible car parking within the boundaries of the Council buildings. Westmeath County Council will also install a baby changing room on site using Department grant funding.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and progressing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p><p>In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p><p>- Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p><p>- established Health and Safety needs;</p><p>- state of development of the project (had a new site been acquired?, etc.); and</p><p>- value for money offered by the proposal.</p><p>This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p><p>Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p><p>In July 2022, representatives of Donegal County Council and the Donegal Municipal district met with officials of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) from my Department regarding plans for Ballyshannon and Bundoran Fire stations. </p><p>At the July meeting the NDFEM officials outlined the application process including the provision of a Business Case, in order that an assessment might be made under the Public Spending Code rules set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the provision of funding allocation.</p><p>Once a business case is received by my Department, it will be evaluated and further considered in the context of the funding available under the existing Capital Programme.</p></reply>

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with local authorities on the implementation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 (the Act) with a view to improving its effectiveness. In this regard, my Department initiated a review of the Act in November 2021 and has sought initial submissions from local authorities on potential improvements to the legislative provisions and the way they are applied.

Ireland is a signatory of the Stockholm Declaration of the International Forum on the Holocaust, and is a member of the Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. In October 2021, Ireland co-signed a Joint Statement on Combating Antisemitism at the 48th Session of the Human Rights Council, along with all other EU member states. At the 51st Session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on Combatting Antisemitism and Online Hatred.</p>  <p>  Support for the Palestinian people, or criticism of the Israeli occupation, is not something that can or should be equated with antisemitism. Criticism of Israeli Government policy is not in itself anti-Semitic, and to conflate these things is counter-productive, and potentially damaging. </p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland consistently underlines the importance of maintaining space for civil society in the occupied Palestinian territory. We are alarmed by the shrinking of civil society space, which we have raised recently at UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council. Civil Society Organisations and human rights defenders play a critical role in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values. In this context, I remain seriously concerned by the designation by Israel of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations, including Irish Aid and EU partner organisations, as terrorist entities. Ireland, along with several other partners providing support to the organisations, has made its views clearly known to Israel, including as regards the unacceptability of the raids carried out on these organisations in August.</p></reply>

On 7 April 2022, two diplomats from the Embassy of Ireland were instructed to leave Russia.  This has limited the ability of the Embassy to provide services and assistance to Irish citizens in Russia. </p><p>In light of ongoing developments, the Department&rsquo;s advice to citizens was further strengthened on 14 April 2022, when Irish citizens in Russia were advised to carefully consider the necessity of their continued stay, and to make plans to leave.</p><p>Irish citizens currently in Russia are advised to be vigilant about their own safety and to avoid mass gatherings, including protests or demonstrations. Citizens should be aware that new laws that affect media freedom of expression can be used to impose severe and arbitrary sentences. Irish citizens should be mindful this includes posting or sharing banned content on social media.</p><p>We also recommend that Irish citizens should be mindful that increasingly severe limitations on banking, including the withdrawal of Visa and Mastercard services, may directly affect their ability to access their money for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Any Irish citizens remaining in Russia are recommended to register their details with our Embassy in Moscow, and they can contact the Embassy should they require assistance. The Embassy will continue to maintain contact with citizens remaining in Russia and to provide consular assistance, where requested and appropriate. The Embassy currently has reduced capacity to provide support in crisis scenarios, particularly for citizens situated far from Moscow. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s travel advice for Russia is set out on the following website:</p><p>www.dfa.ie/travel/travel-advice/a-z-list-of-countries/russian-federation/.</p></reply>

A lasting settlement must include the resolution of all permanent status issues. This includes the issue of refugees, which only the parties can resolve through negotiations, with the support of the international community.</p>  <p>  The renewed acknowledgement by both Prime Minister Lapid and Palestinian President Abbas, at the United Nations General Assembly in September, of the need to work towards a two-State solution was welcome. I also assured President Abbas, during the course of our meeting in Dublin last September, that Ireland stands ready to support all efforts to help resume credible negotiations aimed at achieving a just and lasting two-State solution. This was an issue that I discussed in a number of my bilateral engagements during UN High Level Week in September, including with my counterparts from Algeria, Qatar, Norway, Egypt and Jordan. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, we also continue to witness a situation where Israeli actions on the ground undermine the prospects for progress, including the ongoing threat of evictions and demolitions in Masafer Yatta and the expansion of illegal Israel settlements. Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people on a regular basis directly with the Israeli authorities as well as at EU and UN level.</p>  <p>  It is also vital to address the immediate needs of Palestinian refugees. Ireland is a longstanding supporter of the work of UNRWA, which provides vital services, including education, to 5.7 million registered Palestine refugees in the occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. Last year, Ireland signed an agreement with UNRWA to provide predictable financial support to the Agency, pledging &euro;6 million per annum over three year. During the recent visit to Dublin of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, I was pleased to announce an additional &euro;2 million in funding for UNRWA, bringing our total contribution in 2022 to &euro;8 million.</p></reply>

It is therefore normal and welcome for foreign naval vessels to visit Irish ports, whether that be to carry out joint training with the Irish Naval Service or simply to take crew rest.   Port visits like those of recent months are also indicative of our desire for friendly relations with our neighbours and our desire for the Irish Naval Service to be equipped to communicate with other navies where necessary. The Irish Naval Service regularly visits foreign ports in the same manner.  Foreign naval vessels are only granted permission to visit Irish ports on condition that they meet the necessary policy stipulations. In particular, these require that naval vessels visiting Irish ports do not carry nuclear weapons and do not engage in military exercises. These are the standard stipulations for any naval vessel to visit an Irish port.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of neutrality is characterised by non-membership of military alliances and means that we do not participate in common or mutual defence arrangements. As I have noted previously, our policy of military neutrality continues to inform our active approach towards peace support operations and crisis management, and our contributions to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Ireland is not a party to the Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, and there are no plans for it to become one. Incorporation of its provisions into domestic law accordingly does not arise. </p></reply>

These include supports provided to maximise RDF recruitment, including use of social media, promotion through the DF Press Office, outreach activities by RDF members, and the use of PDF exit interviews which contain information on applying to the RDF. In addition, I am advised by the Military Authorities that a number of measures to streamline recruitment and induction process for the RDF are in train and it is hoped that they will yield a positive outcome.</p><p>While the commitment to restoring the strength of the RDF is not in doubt, it is noted the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is, and will remain a priority.  However, RDF recruitment will continue to be progressed to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Heretofore, there was no provision in the Defence Acts to allow RDF personnel to be deployed overseas. However, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 has been signed into law, which serves to update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces (CODF), published last February, contains many detailed recommendations, including on the future structure and role of the RDF.

This will allow for the required substantial transformation and investment in recruitment and equipment that were identified by the Commission.</p><p>A High Level Action Plan (HLAP) that sets out the Government&rsquo;s response to the CODF has also been approved.</p><p>Some specific initiatives include the immediate commencement of planning for the establishment of an Office of Reserve Affairs with the priority objective of developing a regeneration plan for the Reserve Defence Force. </p></reply>

It is recognised that the principal demand drivers of Defence capital requirements are the ongoing renewal, retention and acquisition of military equipment along with the development and upgrade of Defence Forces built infrastructure.</p><p>The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through a comprehensive Equipment Development Plan which provides a consolidated, structured basis for investment in military equipment to maintain and develop necessary capabilities. Similarly, a Defence Forces Built Infrastructure Programme sets out the requirements for essential infrastructure development works over a medium term timeframe. These strategic frameworks combine to provide the basis for medium term equipment and infrastructural planning and investment requirements for the Defence Forces.</p><p>Multi-Annual capital funding allocations are framed by the overarching National Development Plan, with annual allocations negotiated as part of the annual Estimates process. In 2021, a mid term review of the National Development Plan was undertaken and the capital allocation for Defence was increased to &euro;566 million for the period 2022 to 2025, with annual allocations as follows &ndash;   <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2022 </th>       <th>2023 </th>       <th>2024 </th>       <th>2025 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Defence NDP Capital Funding Allocation </td>       <td>&euro;141m </td>       <td>&euro;141m </td>       <td>&euro;142m </td>       <td>&euro;142m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As part of the Budget Estimates process for 2023, and in line with this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces, the Defence capital allocation for 2023 has increased significantly, by &euro;35 million, to &euro;176 million, a 25% increase on 2022, an allocation which represents the single biggest annual capital investment ever provided to Defence.</p><p>This increase in funding reinforces commitments made by this Government to providing a financial platform for the Defence Sector for the required transformation, as recommended by the Commission on the Defence Forces.</p><p>Many of the Defence Equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times.

A five year Equipment Development Plan for continued re-equipment was developed on a civil military basis and was published in June 2020.  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging priorities, operational requirements and changes in technology. This is an ongoing iterative process.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last.  The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations was undertaken over a period of 5 months by my Department and the Defence Forces.  This involved significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials have engaged with key stakeholders to ascertain their views. Following this engagement, I returned to Government with a High Level Action Plan and a Memo for Government which were approved on July 12th   of this year. As part of this, Government approved a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission, which will entail funding increases to reach a defence budget of c. &euro;1.5 billion (at January 2022 prices) by 2028 through the annual Estimates. </p>  <p>  The recommendation of the Commission on the Defence Forces for the enhancement of the Air Corps&rsquo; fleet with the addition of a fixed wing aircraft has been agreed in principle and now requires an informed approach and full consideration in accordance with the Equipment Planning process. </p>  <p>  As with all capital investment decisions, costing over &euro;10 million, the requirements of the Public Spending Code will need to be met, covering the various steps required in assessing the viability of the proposal and those associated with relevant decision-making and potential subsequent public investment in any additional aircraft.</p></reply>

HSE Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide a range of clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  However, the Department of Education also plays an important role in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of our young people.  The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. </p>  <p>  Aligned with this policy, a number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health.</p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  To support schools in this work the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently providing training to schools to ensure that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school. Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools. These seminars will be supported by two webinars and in-school visits.  </p>  <p>  - At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment. </p>  <p>  - Following the publication by the National Education Psychological Service (NEPS) of guidance for post primary schools on establishing a student support team or reviewing an existing team, psychologists are currently facilitating post-primary schools to improve the Student Support Team process.  Student Support Teams are the structure through which key wellbeing and wellbeing-related policies are implemented in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. </p>  <p>  - NEPS will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. </p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a number of resources to support the wellbeing of children and young people from Ukraine enrolling in schools in Ireland.  This includes:</p>  <p>  - Revised Guidance for primary and post &ndash; primary schools in relation to supporting the wellbeing of children/young people from Ukraine at this time. This includes support for students with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  - Guidance for Parents and Carers from Ukraine on Supporting the Wellbeing of their Children</p>  <p>  - A model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) to help teachers support students. The document is called Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link.</p>  <p>  - NEPS has also delivered a series of wellbeing webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools.</p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.</p>  <p>  I announced in the budget, an additional 54 educational psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes as part of budget 2023. I also announced in the budget that &euro;5 million will be invested in piloting a programme of counselling supports for primary school students. This will serve to support the very positive work which already takes place in the area of wellbeing in our schools. The details of the programme are currently being finalised. </p></reply>

This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already over 125,000 tickets have issued for the 2022/2023 school year. At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services, so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, a 20% overall increase.  There has been an increase of 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. However regrettably, the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the current school year, has led to some delays in issuing tickets.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  In addition, pending completion of the very important review of the School Transport Scheme that I have sought, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th July.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials, in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time, who previously held concessionary tickets, and where capacity allows, to seek to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998 the board of management is responsible for the day to day running of a school.</p><p>School authorities have discretion in relation to the need for school closures whether this arises from adverse weather, failure of heating system, electricity or other unforeseen reasons. It is also the responsibility of the Board to ensure that the school is open for tuition at primary level for 182 days per school year.  The minimum number of tuition days at primary level has reduced from 183 days to 182 as a result of the new public holiday introduced in 2022 and is set out in Circular 0008/2022. </p><p>A Board of Management should assess critically each proposal for closure of its school on days not occurring during the school vacation, in order to determine whether closure of the school is in the best interest of the children. A link to Circular 11/95 is available: here. </p><p>Department Circular 11/95 &ldquo;Time in School&rdquo; states that the school calendar could be subject to change in the event of a closure for an exceptional cause but that as a general rule any unforeseen closure would be compensated later in the school year.  It also advises the Boards of Management that in planning the school year, it should make allowances for days on which the school may have to be closed due to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.  However, schools must ensure the safety of those in their care and give due consideration to this in making a decision on whether to close a school.</p><p>The Department does not centrally determine whether or not a school can close once the overall number of teaching days is delivered by the school over the course of the year as the decision rests with the Board of Management of the school.</p><p>Parents should engage with their local school regarding the arrangements for school closure at a local level.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).</p><p>In accordance with Department Circulars 0044/2019 and 31/2011, schools are required to employ appropriately qualified and registered teachers and ensure that unemployed teachers should be offered employment in preference to those who have retired</p><p>My Department runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of both primary and post-primary teachers.</p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools. </p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <i>Sub Seeker</i>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>Newly qualified teachers (NQTs) will also represent a new source of supply in 2022/23. In excess of 3,400 primary and post-primary NQTs have had their registrations finalised by the Teaching Council to date with almost 40 further applications currently in progress.  In addition, approximately 100 NQTs have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 4.  Teachers registered under Route 4 are eligible for employment as a teacher in restricted school settings, i.e. in certain categories of special schools and in certain classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</p><p>The Teaching Council also recently made regulations allowing for the registration of 3rd and 4th year undergraduate ITE students under a new registration route, Route 5 (Student Teachers).  To date, in excess of 1,200 student teachers have registered with the Teaching Council with a further 70 applications still being processed.  Once registered with the Council, such student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitutable vacancies.</p><p>My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to address challenges faced by schools and to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

The DEIS programme focuses on targeting additional supports to those schools with the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage. Last March I was glad to announce a major expansion of this programme. This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach. The Wellbeing Policy contains a number of high level actions including an action to promote the wellbeing of school staff.  The policy recognises the importance of the relationships between all members of the school community and ongoing professional development of teachers.  </p><p>My Department offers an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) for all school staff in recognised primary and post primary schools.

The department is now implementing a project to provide high speed broadband connectivity through the Schools Broadband Programme for primary schools outside of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area, and where commercial provision is neither available nor planned. That project is supported by funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and is managed by HEAnet on behalf of my department.

The provider will shortly be in contact with the school directly to organise the final connection within the school.</p>  <p>  As you are aware the Department is obliged to adhere to procurement regulations and must engage with the selected providers on the DES Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. This is the basis on which all state-funding is utilised to ensure transparency and equal treatment for all schools and providers, and adherence to regulatory requirements. </p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2021 was &euro;289m.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  In addition, pending completion of the very important review of the School Transport Scheme , Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th July.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials, in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time, who previously held concessionary tickets, and where capacity allows, to seek to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity. </p></reply>

This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the school planning area where they have sufficient places, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  Aside from the obligation outlined above, the question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron.   A survey of schools' capacity to accommodate Ukrainian students undertaken by my Department earlier in 2022 indicated good capacity across primary and post primary level in the Lucan school planning area, with potential capacity of circa 500 places being identified by schools, mostly at primary level.  </p>  <p>  My Department does, additionally, work with patrons and school authorities to establish the true extent of any capacity issues in an area. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department proactively engages with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly.

This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme.

Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with the local Council in respect of its review of the Development Plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements.

Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school.

However, applications for transport were not received until 25 August 2022 for the 2022/23 school year and they are therefore, deemed as a late application. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  Following the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.  However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.

The Act also bestows on the Minister all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the purpose of performing her functions.</p>  <p>  It also stipulates that in carrying out her functions, the Minister must have regard to the resources available and the practices and traditions relating to the organisation of existing schools and their right to manage their own affairs in accordance with the Act and any charters, deeds, articles of management or other such instruments relating to their establishment or operation.</p>  <p>  Historically, school patrons monitored demographic increases at local level and sought approval from the Department to extend existing schools or provide new schools where a significant level of demand could not be met within existing school capacity. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, new arrangements have been in place for the establishment of new schools involving the forecasting of demand for school places based on demographic exercises carried out by the Department. New schools are only established in areas of demographic growth as the resources available for school infrastructure have to be prioritised to meet the needs of areas of significant population increase so as to ensure that every child has a school place. </p>  <p>  The arrangements also give an opportunity to patrons to apply for the patronage of new schools. The criteria used in deciding on the patronage of new schools place a particular emphasis on parental patronage and language preferences and an analysis of existing provision in the areas where the schools are being established.</p>  <p>  This approach is underpinned by a 2011 Government Decision.</p>  <p>  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.</p>  <p>  A prospective patron can choose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents can then access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (with the exception of the Irish-medium primary gaelscoileanna which have been designated as Irish-medium prior to the opening of the OPPS - in the case of these schools, parents can select their preferred patron).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). This Group was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools. Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on the education section of the gov.ie website.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p>  <p>  For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  Circular 0030/2014 provides details of the primary care needs for which SNA support will usually be provided and sets out the types of secondary care associated tasks which SNAs may often perform, but only once they have been allocated on the basis of a requirement to provide for primary care needs.</p>  <p>  While the education system focuses on supporting the teaching and learning needs of students with disabilities, the HSE is responsible for providing additional health and social care supports in Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams across the country. Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams (CDNTs) provide a single, uniform and equitably accessible system of disability services for children and young people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  In terms of considering a new model of supports for children with special educational needs and disabilities in our schools, my Department is currently providing funding for the School Inclusion Model project which is operating in some schools. The SIM is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education which works on the principle of providing the right support at the right time delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets.  The purpose of the SIM is to build the capacity of participating schools so they can support the inclusion of all children particularly those with special educational needs (SEN). It is intended to review the impact of the SIM project to inform future policy decisions. Consideration of the NCSE policy advice on special classes and special schools will also be significant in this regard also. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce a personal assistant service (personal budget) for children with disabilities in schools at this time.</p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or exhibiting behaviours of concern until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen.</p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.</p>  <p>  Tusla's Educational Welfare Service, has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour. </p>  <p>  Further to the receipt of policy advice from the NCSE, the Department of Education established an Expert Working Group to develop guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours (including the use of physical interventions) where such behaviour is considered as likely to present serious risk of physical harm to the student concerned and/or others within the school environment.</p>  <p>  Development of the Guidelines has been informed by evidence showing that whole school positive behavioural approaches and early and ongoing engagement with the school community, including parents/guardians, are necessary for the development of effective school policy and practice.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of the views and contributions received as part of the consultation process, a final draft of the guidelines has been prepared and is being considered by the Department.  They place a strong focus on prevention and early intervention strategies for the management of crisis student behaviour in which physical intervention may be employed only as the last part of a comprehensive, positive and planned behavioural approach by the school. They are underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour and the need for such incidents to be recorded.</p>  <p>  The guidelines when issued will apply to all schools. In this regard, consideration is being given to the implementation of guidelines by schools including the kind of supports and training that may be required. </p>  <p>Guidelines for schools on reduced school days were published on 16th September 2021 and came into effect from 1st   January 2022. Please see link below which contains a copy of the guidelines and an information note for parents: www.gov.ie/en/circular/f49bd-0047-2021/</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Guidelines on the use of Reduced School days is to ensure that the use of reduced school days are limited to only those circumstances where it is absolutely necessary and, that where such usage occurs, schools follow best practice with the best interests of the student to the fore. The Guidelines also outline a number of key requirements for the use of reduced school days.</p>  <p>  A school can only place a child on a Reduced School Day if the parent/guardians give their consent. A parent/guardian is not obliged to consent to this. If consent is given the school must complete a form and it must be sent to Tusla Education Support Services(TESS), the parent/guardian must sign this form giving their consent to the use of a Reduced School Day. It is also important to note that a parent/guardian may withdraw their consent at any time. </p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) have a dedicated Reduced School Day team in place, and they provide support and assistance to parents/guardians if needed.  </p></reply>

From 2021, all schools were given the opportunity to run at least one summer programme.</p>  <p>  In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes in 2022 was up to &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the programme continues to focus on supporting pupils with complex special educational needs and my Department has provided support to schools to run the summer programme to cater for these students. </p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allowed principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff. Capitation funding and preparation hours were provided to schools who participated in the programme, with additional funding and hours provided to schools that run the Special Class and Special School Programme.  Further funding was also made available to Special Schools, in recognition of the extra complexities in running programmes in their schools.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;20 million funding has been approved under Budget &lsquo;23 to continue the expanded summer programme for 2023, bringing the total to &euro;40m for 2023 which was formally announced this week. This early announcement that funding has been secured will allow schools several extra months to plan for a summer programme next year.</p>  <p>  The programme has gone from strength to strength with 2022 seeing more schools and more students participate than ever before. Final figures for this year&rsquo;s programme will be known later in the year but based on the information available to date, it is anticipated that over 45,000 pupils will have participated with over 1,000 schools running a programme. </p>  <p>  I am however very conscious that parents want this programme to be available in more schools in 2023 and, as part of the planning that has already begun for next year. The Department is committed to on-going development of the summer programme with a view to ensuring that children that need it, have access to this support.  For 2023, it is a priority that more children in special schools have access to a school-based programme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education is also currently reviewing the summer programme and engaging with relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders so that more children can participate in 2023. It is important that schools are given the support they need to be able to run a programme during the summer and the review will also be taking account of administration needs, workforce expansion, and training requirements that are vital components for the schools.</p>  <p>  The Inspectorate in the Department has also visited schools, including special schools as part of that process, and are liaising with staff, parents and the children who participated to help ensure that the review takes account of the lived experience. The Department will also look at innovative way to promote and publicise the programme for next summer to further raise awareness of the scheme and publicise the benefits of running a scheme.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the review, full details, including information and guidance for parents, schools and staff will be published at the earliest possible opportunity in 2023.</p></reply>

Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs-based approach. </p><p>While the Sections of the EPSEN Act relating to an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs and the consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP) have not been implemented, I can advise that all schools are encouraged to have support plans in place for children with special needs. My Department's Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education support plans for children with special needs.</p><p>In relation to the above, as the Deputy will be aware, as announced in December 2021, I have sought a review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, which provides for the education of children aged under 18 years with special educational needs. The EPSEN Act 2004, is now in place for more than 18 years and there have been many significant changes and developments to policy relating to the education of children with special needs in that time.  </p><p>The purpose of the review is to ensure that legislation on education for students with additional needs is up-to-date, fully operational, and reflective of the lived experiences of students and families. This includes those sections of the Act relating to IEPs. Open collaboration and consultation are at the heart of the review and all stakeholders are being invited to engage with the process.</p><p>A number of steps have been taken by my Department in relation to this important review of legislation. Establishment of a Steering Group, Working Group and Advisory Group have been completed and all the groups have had multiple engagements. </p><p>A full stakeholder engagement took place on the 21st June last, to discuss concerns and proposals in relation to this review, which was very positive. A large amount of work has occurred over the summer months to prepare categories of public surveys and a consultation paper to inform members of the public of the review. It is intended to launch the public survey within the coming weeks. Focus groups will be organised at the conclusion of the public survey to explore key themes that arise as result of the survey analysis. </p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the purpose of the review is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative basis for the educational provision, both current and planned, for children with special educational needs in order to protect the interests of the children concerned and their families and those of the state.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  When appointing an SNA, it is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of the pupil(s) for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school.  </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required relating to the care needs of pupils, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.  It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally based on the specific care needs of the children enrolled in the school. The Department has no role in providing such training and does not hold the information requested.  </p>  <p>  When a school opens a special class, considerable supports and resources are made available from the National Council of Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service, including a seminar for principals, training courses for staff, and each school is linked with an NCSE advisor.</p>  <p>  In relation to ongoing training for SNA&rsquo;s, the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) was published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  The NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs.</p>  <p>  The policy advice was considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, was selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. This programme began in January 2021 with an intake of 500 students.</p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role.</p>  <p>  Participation is voluntary and the programme is fully funded by the Department. Each participant who completes the programme successfully receives a certificate from UCD School of Education.</p></reply>

Membership is made up of representatives from a number of Government Departments, including my Department. The CEO of the National Council for Special Education is also a member of this Group. </p>  <p>  Separately, the National Education and Health Collaborative Forum supports education and health to work together cohesively, share key information and develop joint working, where required, to optimise outcomes for children and their families. Membership is comprised of representatives from the Health Service Executive (HSE), National Counsel for Special Education (NCSE) and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS). </p>  <p>  In addition to these two groups, in the last two years the Department of An Taoiseach has overseen a further cross Departmental and agency group looking specifically at the areas of 1) therapies and 2) school places for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This group has included senior officials from the Department of Health, Education, Children, Equality, Disability Integration and Youth as well as from the NCSE and HSE. Updates on progress in the area has been provided to relevant Ministers who attend Cabinet sub-Committee on these issues.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently engaged in the Education and health working group which is a framework for collaborative engagement and better working between health and education professionals. The purpose of the group is to guide the establishment of Education and Health Forums at local level, including representatives of parents, health services and education partners, in order to facilitate networking, building relationships and to share information. </p>  <p>  - To support the development of national joint Policies, Procedures, Protocols and Guidelines between Education and Health, as required. </p>  <p>  - To provide guidance regarding the content of relevant training programmes in both sectors to ensure consistency, eliminate duplication and maximize use of available resources. </p>  <p>  - To oversee the development of a national online directory of resources to include information and links on disabilities, health services, education, community supports and subsections for regional/local specific supports and services.</p>  <p>  - To oversee implementation of the Guidance on Coordination of Key Transitions for Children and Young People with Complex Disabilities as a template for local education and health forums to develop their own pathways for the key stages of transitions.   </p>  <p>  - To ensure the voice of children and young people, and their parents is heard in all the above development works. </p>  <p>  At local level forums are established to further this work and specifically with a view: </p>  <p>  - To facilitate joint and collaborative practices at a local level to share information and facilitate the provision of services to children and their families.</p>  <p>  - And to address issues of common concern to those in the education and health sectors engaged in supporting children with disabilities. Issues which affect one sector only will continue to be addressed by existing forums/management groups in each sector. </p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to advise, monitor and oversee the development, coordination and implementation of the trialing of a School Inclusion Model as approved by Government on 12 February 2019.</p>  <p>  The Group is chaired by the Department of Education, and comprise high level representation from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform; Health; and Children and Youth Affairs.  </p>  <p>  The Group provide a forum for the lead actors with responsibility for delivering the actions underlying the model to agree it&rsquo;s planning and delivery.</p>  <p>  Other objectives of the strand are to develop protocols and relationships to work with external bodies, such as the HSE and NEPS, and with therapists not employed by NCSE who are providing support to children.</p>  <p>  As part of the School Inclusion Model (SIM), the Steering Group established a nursing subgroup.  The nursing supports subgroup were tasked with looking, in the context of improving access to nursing supports for children in mainstream schools and in special school settings. Members of the nursing group consist of personnel from Department of Education, Health Service Executive, Department of Health and NCSE. </p></reply>

The Admission Statement sets out that the school will not discriminate against an applicant on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, disability, race, member of traveller community or special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the pupil/student should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils/student not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.   </p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, the parent of the student, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, may appeal a decision of this school to refuse admission. An appeal may be made under Section 29 (1)(c)(i) of the Education Act 1998 where the refusal to admit was due to the school being oversubscribed. An appeal may be made under Section 29 (1)(c)(ii) of the Education Act 1998 where the refusal to admit was due a reason other than the school being oversubscribed.</p>  <p>TUSLA&rsquo;s Education Support Service (TESS) which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

All new and existing ITE programmes have been aligned with C&eacute;im for first year student teachers. There are seven core elements to C&eacute;im one of which is Professional Identity and Agency. </p><p>Professional Identity and Agency includes support for the development of the teacher as a self-reflective autonomous professional and newly qualified teachers are expected to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of continuum of teacher educations and be committed to lifelong personal and professional learning which reflects the approach taken to their work. </p><p><b>School Placement/Treoraithe</b></p><p>School placement is a central feature of initial teacher education, where student teachers are welcomed and supported by Higher Education Institution (HEI) tutors, school principals, class teachers and the school community.</p><p>Student teachers can observe experienced teachers teaching and develop their knowledge, skills, competences and professional dispositions.  Also, Treoraithe, formerly known as co-operating teachers,  are afforded the opportunity to share their professional expertise and to observe and be informed about a variety of approaches to teaching and learning through engagement with student teachers and HEIs.</p><p><b>NIPT</b></p><p>The National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) is a Department funded service that supports the induction of newly qualified teachers (NQTs), both primary and post-primary, into the teaching profession in Ireland. </p><p>The <i>Droichead </i>process is an integrated professional induction framework for newly qualified teachers and supports the professional learning of the NQTs during the induction phase, thus laying the foundations for subsequent professional growth and learning for the next phase of their career. Droichead is fundamentally about the NQT&rsquo;s professional journey and the process of their induction. The first strand is a school-based induction through which the NQT is supported by experienced colleagues. The second strand is made up of additional professional learning activities which involves attendance at NQT cluster meetings, and one other professional learning activity, related to the needs of the NQT.  A key part of the <i>Droichead</i>process is an NQT&rsquo;s engagement with more experienced colleagues, and reflection on the professional conversations that take place on their own professional learning and practice. </p><p><b>PDST</b></p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is a Department funded national teacher-support service offering high quality and relevant continuing professional development to teachers and school leaders in a range of pedagogical, curricular and educational areas.  The aim of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is to provide high-quality professional development and support that empowers teachers and schools to provide the best possible education for all pupils/students supporting teachers as reflective practitioners by providing a range of professional development opportunities and supports that facilitate teacher learning, collaboration and evidence-based practice with an emphasis on: </p><p>- Curriculum and Pedagogy;</p><p>- Learning and Teaching Methodologies;</p><p>- School Improvement and School Self-evaluation;</p><p>- School Leadership, Culture and Leading Learning;</p><p>- Pupil/Student and Teacher Welfare;</p><p>- Information and Communications Technology.</p><p>Collaboratives for teachers form an integral part of the professional development and aim to support and promote effective collaborative communities of practice using a tailored continuing professional development (CPD) approach.  These provide opportunities for professional sharing, modelling practice, collaboration and a solution-focussed approach to teaching, learning and assessment in the classroom. </p><p><b>CSL </b></p><p>In terms of supporting Primary Teachers the Centre for School Leadership (CSL) provides Professional Executive Coaching to Principals - many of whom are full time teachers (Teaching Principals) in primary schools and to primary teachers who are part of the school leadership team as well as bespoke mentoring to teaching principals both in their first year in the role and more sustained mentoring for those experiencing professional challenge.<b></b></p><p><b>Cos&aacute;n:  Framework for Teachers&rsquo; Learning</b></p><p>Cos&aacute;n, which was published by the Teaching Council, is the national framework for teachers&rsquo; learning.<i></i>Cos&aacute;n means pathway and this name was chosen to reflect the fact that teachers&rsquo; learning is a journey.  It marks the continuation of a journey that teachers undertake from Initial Teacher Education, through Induction via the Droichead model, and this professional learning should continue across the duration of a teacher&rsquo;s career.  </p><p>Central to Cos&aacute;n is a vision of teachers as professionals who are intrinsically motivated to take ownership of their professional learning and development. Through Cos&aacute;n, the Teaching Council is seeking to foster a culture of professional learning based on teachers&rsquo; active engagement in their own learning, for their benefit and that of their students.</p><p>Cos&aacute;n acknowledges the many ways in which teachers have told the Teaching Council that they learn. It thus provides a clear and accessible framework for teachers&rsquo; ongoing professional learning to be recognised, in the context of their status as registered professionals. </p><p>Cos&aacute;n also recognises the fact that professional learning is &ldquo;<i>part and parcel of a teacher&rsquo;s working life</i>&rdquo;.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

The review of the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, parents, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.

NEPS provides a broad service and encompasses a model that seeks to strengthen the overall capacity of the system to support the wellbeing, participation and inclusion of all children and young people in our schools, but particularly for those with special educational needs.  Our psychologists work with teachers, parents and children/young people in schools to provide a range of services as follows:</p>  <p>  - Psychologists support schools to identify and respond to need, through regular planning and review meetings. </p>  <p>  - They provide support to schools in the event of a Critical Incident. </p>  <p>  - They provide a school staff Support and Development Service, which supports school staff in their work.  This might include, for example, training staff in the provision of trauma informed school approaches, or in the provision of evidence-based programmes to strengthen resilience and reduce anxiety.  This broad service is provided to an estimated 25,000 school staff annually.</p>  <p>  - Psychologists also provide an individual casework service for children and young people, and this is a much valued element of their work in schools.  This is where the focus of the work is on individual students, and the psychologist meets school staff, parents and the student themselves, in order to identify and assess student strengths and needs and agree on an appropriate plan of intervention and review.  In these cases, NEPS psychologists always provide a written report for parents and the school principal.  In 2021, the NEPS casework service extended to over 8500 students. Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students.</p>  <p>  My Department has established a high-level working group, chaired by the Secretary General, to examine how NEPS can best continue to recruit adequate numbers of suitably qualified staff and continue to respond to the educational psychological needs of children in recognised primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  The group has agreed on a number of actions that must be taken to address supply issues in the medium to long term. These include the development of a workforce plan for educational psychologists within the Department of Education and work has begun with other Government Departments to advance this.</p>  <p>  A number of options were considered to address some immediate supply issues.  Following analysis of these, it was decided that the Department would use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third year students of the Educational Psychology Doctoral programme in University College Dublin (UCD) and Mary Immaculate College (MIC) University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022/23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.  The workforce planning group referred to above will be asked to make some interim recommendations in Q2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of their final report. It is envisaged that funding supports for students on the educational psychological doctorate programme will be considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  In the interim, given the particular time pressures for students in third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students of Educational Psychology, currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023.  Details will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Already over 125,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to applicants for the new school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply, and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.

Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy did not request a ticket before the closing date of 29th July 2022.

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that my Department previously funded 13 centres through an ABA pilot scheme for the period 1999-2011.  All of these centres applied for and were granted recognition as Special Schools for children with Autism and now form part of the network of special schools. A transitional agreement was put in place between the Department and Patrons of these schools to manage this process.</p><p>As part of the transitional agreement my Department continues to provide grant funding to these schools to engage behaviour practitioners. This arrangement has been extended for the 2022/23 school year. There are no plans to increase this grant payment.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme for children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO.</p>  <p>  Two of the siblings referred to by the Deputy are eligible under the terms of the above scheme and I am pleased to advise that they are being accommodated on a dedicated service for children with special educational needs, however, the third sibling is not eligible under the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs. This is reflected in the standard of dedicated service provided and the fact that these services are generally planned and timetabled to operate on a door-to-door basis. In certain cases, the Department also provides funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children whose care and safety needs require this level of support while they travel to and from school.</p>  <p>  Given the concerns regarding welfare of children with special educational needs, it is not always practical to make these services available to children who are capable of travelling on standard mainstream school transport services.  As to do so might diminish the level of care and safety that the Department and Bus Eireann wish to provide for these vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  Children who are attending mainstream schools may apply for school transport in accordance with the terms of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Schemes for Primary Schools.</p></reply>

The school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the pupil/student should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils/student not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p>  <p>  A school may not provide priority based on a student's connection to the school by virtue of a member of his or her family attending or having previously attended the school, however an exception is made, where a parent or grandparent of the student concerned has previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places for such children of past pupils does not exceed 25% of the available places in the school.  Schools can also include a selection criteria for siblings of the student is attending or has attended the school.</p>  <p>  The act prohibits schools when deciding on an application from taking into account the occupation, financial status, academic, ability, skills or aptitude of a student&rsquo;s parents. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy. In relation to the request of a school referred to by the Deputy seeking the occupation of the parents, the Department will contact the school in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Schools may also appoint persons to replace retirements which occur over the course of the school year.</p><p>I recognise the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.  </p><p>Accordingly, significant additional supports have been provided in recent years to support leadership in schools, providing for additional posts of responsibility which support to work of school Principals. </p><p>Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts.  The equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) were restored at both Primary and Post-Primary level. (2,600 in total)</p><p>The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which has ensured that the current level of Posts of Responsibility (POR&rsquo;s) are maintained in the school system. New POR threshold tables are produced each year to distribute these POR&rsquo;s equitably across all school.</p><p>Currently one in three teachers hold a promotional post within our schools.</p><p>The Sectoral Bargaining process under Building Momentum for the primary sector has been used to increase posts of responsibility (POR) in primary and special schools by 1,450 posts. The distribution of these additional posts of responsibility are comprehended in Circular 0043/2022 - Allocation of Assistant Principal Posts 2022/2023.</p><p>Since the commencement of the restoration of these posts at Post-Primary, there has also been an increased allocation in respect to Deputy Principal posts with over 450 additional posts allocated to schools. In the 2021/22 school year, the enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional deputy principal in DEIS post-primary schools was reduced from 700 to 600 pupils. These additional posts provide resources to focus on leadership and management in our schools.</p><p>This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p><p>I am also aware that Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for school leaders is vital in developing the skills, knowledge and dispositions that are critical to effective leadership in schools.</p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Leadership Team supports leaders at all levels within schools, while the Centre for School Leadership also provides Professional Executive Coaching to Principals in primary schools and to primary teachers who are part of the school leadership team.</p><p>The Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) supports also provides a comprehensive programme of CPD for school leaders and teachers.</p><p>Supports are provided for school leaders regularly throughout the school year and addresses the expressed needs of school leaders. </p></reply>

For example, class D contributors currently pay a contribution at the rate of 0.9% on their weekly earnings up to &euro;1,443 and 4% on weekly earnings over that amount and their employers pay a contribution of 2.35% on all employee earnings.

Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Delays can arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.</p>  <p>  The processing target for the Invalidity Pension (IP) scheme is to award 90% of applications within 10 weeks. Currently the average number of weeks to award an IP claim in September 2022 is 9 weeks and the average number of weeks to award an IP claim in 2022 to the end of September was 7 weeks.

This requirement necessitates the sourcing of a building that is  immediately available and can meet the operational requirements of AGS.  </p>  <p>  Given the urgency of the situation, the property on the Navan Road has been identified by OPW as the only one that would meet the State&rsquo;s urgent requirement in the short/medium term and would represent optimum use of the property.  My Department has not entered into an agreement with AGS regarding the lease or rental of the building, as the building is owned by the OPW.</p>  <p>  This will not represent any deterioration in customer service. Since temporary closure in April 2022, people living in the Dublin 7 area who need to attend an Intreo Centre have been visiting the Parnell Street Intreo Centre.  There is also a freephone telephone number and the dedicated email addresses for Navan Road services relating to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, one-parent family payments, Public Services Cards, community welfare services and activation remain active.  </p>  <p>  The quickest and easiest way for a person to apply for income supports is online at www.mywelfare.ie.  </p></reply>

The requirement to physically present at a post office to collect a welfare payment is an important financial control.  This is particularly important for Jobseekers as the qualifying criteria for that scheme include being resident in the State and being available for work.</p>  <p>  When health restrictions were introduced in 2020, all Jobseekers were given the option of being paid into a bank account.  This was an exceptional temporary measure to help reduce the spread of the virus and to ensure that people could comply with social distancing guidelines. </p>  <p>  In line with the general easing of Covid-19 restrictions earlier this year, I had asked my Department to revert to the pre-pandemic payment rules for Jobseekers&rsquo; payments. </p>  <p>  This change was applied to new claims initially.  Over the coming months, my Department will work to extend the post office requirement to other Jobseeker claims.</p>  <p>  Following your representation my officials reviewed the circumstances under which the payment method was changed for the person concerned.  It has been determined that the person should have been allowed to continue to receive her Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) at this time.  Officials have contacted the person concerned to advise her accordingly.  When the person provides my Department with her new bank details they will be promptly updated and her Jobseeker's Benefit payment will be paid into her nominated bank account.  Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.</p></reply>

It is a scheme which, by its nature, is a short-term social welfare scheme.  It has a high degree of churn with people coming onto the scheme and moving off every week, often with very short duration claims.   For example, between July and September 2022, almost 115,000 Illness Benefit claims were awarded, and of these, only 21,000 remain in payment. This indicates a churn of 82% over just a three-month period. The average duration on Illness Benefit is 6 days.</p>  <p>  In addition, many Illness Benefit payments are paid directly to the employer. Therefore, a double payment such as the cost of living support would, in many cases, be an employer subsidy as opposed to an additional support to the customer. This is not the intent behind the October cost of living support, and nor would it be a targeted use of resources.</p>  <p>  If an individual or family are struggling with additional costs, Additional Needs Payments can provide help and support to people facing financial hardship. Under the scheme, the Department may make an Additional Needs Payment to people on a low income, whether they are working or receiving an income support, to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. A major national awareness campaign has promoted and raised awareness of the Additional Needs Payment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Disablement Benefit will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance and will no longer result in a household being disqualified because a person in the household is in receipt of that payment.  In addition, half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments will also be disregarded for the Fuel Allowance means assessment.  </p>  <p>  From January 2023, there will be a new means threshold for people aged 70 and over, of &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.  In addition, these applicants no longer have to be in receipt of a qualifying payment to access Fuel Allowance, provided they satisfy the means test and the household composition rules.</p>  <p>  Many of these households will also benefit from the additional cost of living payments which will be paid between now and the end of the year.  The enhanced electricity credit of &euro;600, with a value of &euro;1.3 billion, is a further Government measure that will benefit all Irish households.  The first &euro;200 is to be applied to electricity bills before Christmas.  </p>  <p>  Officials at my Department are working on the operational requirements for the implementation of these budget measures.  The current priority is to make the necessary IT system changes to deliver the additional payments between now and the end of the year to include: the double-week in social welfare payments in October and December; the Fuel Allowance payment of &euro;400 for qualified recipients in the week commencing 14 November; the living alone payment of &euro;200; and the &euro;500 payment for people with disabilities, for those in receipt of Working Family Payment, and for carers in November 2022.  </p>  <p>  Details in relation to the application process for those aged 70 and over, including how and when to apply, will be advertised by my Department towards the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided &euro;68.1 million for the programme with an additional &euro;9m provided to allow access to all new DEIS schools from September 2022.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 children for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to earlier. Every DEIS school that submitted an expression of interest to be included in the hot school meals extension announced in Budget 2021 are now receiving funding for hot school meals.</p>  <p>  In March 2022, the Minister for Education announced an extension of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School to an additional 322 schools from September 2022.  In July, I announced that the provision of the hot school meal option will be extended to all new DEIS primary schools and the cold lunch option to all new DEIS secondary schools benefitting some 60,000 children at an additional cost of &euro;9m in 2022. </p>  <p>  Invitations were issued to the 284 new DEIS primary schools to apply for the hot meal option and the 38 new DEIS secondary schools to apply for the cold lunch option following my announcement.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy did not submit an expression of interest for the extension of hot school meals in 2021 nor are they one of the new DEIS schools announced that received an invitation to apply for the hot school meals option from September 2022. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have responded to communications from the school directly regarding this matter and have outlined this selection process. The school has also been assured that they remain eligible to receive funding for the breakfast and the cold lunch.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to expand the school meals programme and building further on the significant extension of the programme in recent years.  In this regard, I commissioned the evaluation of the school meals programme to review all elements of the programme.  The final report is due to be completed in November 2022 and will be published thereafter.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

No. 128 of 2021) which came into force on 22nd April 2021. </p>  <p>  The general principle followed in respect of the transposition of IORP II, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform, is that the requirements of IORP II apply to all schemes and trust RACs, including one-member arrangements (&lsquo;OMAs&rsquo;).  This is in order to ensure that all members and beneficiaries are afforded equal protection irrespective of the size of the pension arrangement.  It should be noted that the decision to apply the requirements of IORP II to all schemes and trust RACs was announced by the Government in 2019 and it was expected that trustees and insurance providers would have been preparing for compliance with these requirements in advance of transposition.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) published in late 2020 set out a number of measures to aid in the harmonisation and simplification of supplemental pensions.  One of these relates to the abolition of the differential treatment of PRSAs for funding purposes, and the BIK treatment of employer contributions to PRSAs.</p>  <p>  The Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, comprising officials from the relevant Departments and organisations reconvened in 2021 to consider implementation of the various recommendations. Following enactment of a package of tax-related measures in the Finance Act 2021 a number of further proposals from the Report are currently being worked on, some of which are technical in nature and others which have wider policy implications necessitating careful consideration through the normal policy channels. </p>  <p>  The progression of measures relating to the taxation of PRSAs is a matter for the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

That month, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report, "Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC)&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 states that the new Core Funding stream should incorporate funding for administration and to support the employment of graduate staff. Core Funding is underpinned by the Employment Regulation Orders, and its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p>  <p>  While Core Funding operates in addition to and alongside the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. </p>  <p>  Pobal continues to provide support and assistance directly to early learning and childcare providers through their dedicated Early Years Provider Centre. There is a dedicated suite of training aids and reference material, including videos, available on The Hive to assist users.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with Pobal on continued enhancements to the system to ensure it is responsive to early learning and childcare providers' business needs. Pobal is also arranging to engage with system users to see where further training or support may be required.</p>  <p>  Providers experiencing issues using the Hive can also avail of assistance from the City and County Childcare Committees who are funded by my Department to provide supports directly to providers in their area, including one-to-one guidance, and training via a dedicated training platform for the Hive users.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised by my officials that they will also be engaging with all key stakeholders to explore how the system may be further enhanced to minimise administrative burden on providers as additional supports for families and the sector come on stream. </p>  <p>  I would note that my Department has commenced a review of the ECCE programme which is expected to be completed by Q3 2023. The review will assess whether the ECCE Programme is meeting its core objectives and will identify any changes or improvements that can be made to the Programme, based on international evidence, experience to date as well as consultation from a wide number of stakeholders.</p></reply>

This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families. </p>  <p>  Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that to date, 91% - well over 4,000 - providers have signed up. Out of all services which have an active ECCE contract, the figure is higher - 93%.</p>  <p>  This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff and a commitment not to increase fees.</p>  <p>  3,869 services have an active ECCE contract. Of these services, 277 have not yet come into contract for Core Funding. These services include services that only offer the ECCE programme and mixed services that also offer additional provision in alongside the ECCE programme.  Services may chose to come in to Core Funding at any point throughout the programme year.</p>  <p>  While a large majority of providers have embraced Core Funding, some have raised concerns about the impact of the changes to the funding model on small services in particular. The rationale for the change in approach is to allow for a fairer distribution of supports for graduate staff and I have been unequivocal that no service will lose out in the funding this year compared to last year.  The safety net of sustainability supports is available for the small number who may experience financial difficulty.</p>  <p>  Core Funding allows for a very substantial increase in the total cost base for the sector without requiring those costs to be passed on to parents. The vast majority of services are seeing substantial increases in funding. No service will see a decrease in funding. Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. Core Funding is worth at least a 9.5 % increase to ECCE services.  The value of Core Funding is greater if more hours of service or service for younger children is offered.  </p>  <p>  With Core Funding in operation for five weeks, key achievements already include:</p>  <p>  - Fee management in place for 91% services meaning that fees cannot increase on September 2021 levels, and ensures that developments in National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are fully realised by parents.</p>  <p>  - Agreement of Employment Regulation Orders covering staff at all grades in the sector and instituting differential pay rates for graduate staff in certain roles, putting in place a career framework for staff in the sector to support recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  - Improved pay for an estimated 73% of those working in the sector who will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders, which would not have been achieved without Core Funding.</p>  <p>  - A significant expansion of capacity, resulting in more hours of provision for parents and children and opportunities for staff to work more hours per week and weeks per year. </p>  <p>  We are not seeing any evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. Services can be assisted on an individual basis through this route and it also allows for trends and themes across the country to be identified that can inform a more systematic response if necessary.</p>  <p>  Across the country, the 30 CCCs have been working intensively to support individual providers and parents with the new scheme and continue to be available to do so.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1,025m to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.</p></reply>

The overall objective of the Action Plan is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding. The National Action Plan can be found at www.gov.ie/childminding.</p><p>A Steering Group was formed in September 2021 to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the commitments published in the National Action Plan.<b></b>The Steering Group is chaired by my Department and includes representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders. The Steering Group is supported by four Advisory Groups (membership of which includes representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders) in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and stakeholder engagement, consultation and communications. </p><p>The roles of the Steering Group include: providing strategic direction for the National Action Plan, drawing on the advice of the Advisory Groups, and drawing on any consultation and research that the Steering Group deems necessary; advising my Department on policy, regulatory and budgetary measures that may be needed to ensure effective implementation of the National Action Plan; monitoring identified and emerging risks, and identifying measures to mitigate risks. The Steering Group meets at least 4 times per year.</p><p>The Steering Group is required to submit an annual progress report to myself. I am looking forward to receiving the Steering Group's first annual progress report over the coming months.</p><p>The minutes of the meetings of the Steering Group are published on my Department's website.

As stipulated in the EU Work Life Balance Directive 2019/1158, the leave is non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to bond with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit.</p><p>It is important to note that the entitlement under the Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 (as amended) is for each parent in their own right and it is not an allocation per family.  The Act was drafted in such a way as to take account of the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent. </p><p>This means that each parent of the child, and their respective spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, is entitled to take parent&rsquo;s leave in respect of that child.  In effect this means that, if the parents of a child are not a couple but are in a separate relationship then their partner is entitled to parent&rsquo;s leave to care for the child.  </p><p>Family leave entitlements are kept under review to ensure that they are effective and respond to the needs of families. The EU Work Life Balance Directive requires nine weeks paid parental leave for each parent by August 2024.  However, there are no amendments to parent's leave currently planned.</p></reply>

Current policy requires that any request for an exemption from ECCE eligibility must be supported by a letter from a medical specialist / Social Worker (not a GP/PHN) specifically recommending an exemption for the child.</p>  <p>  This requirement was communicated to the parent of the child referred to and once the documentation is received, the application can be processed. Applications cannot be considered without this documentation.</p>  <p>  In making determinations on applications for over age exemptions, my Department is guided by a review of the over-age exemption process, which was carried out in 2018 by the National Disability Authority (NDA) for this Department and the Department of Education.</p>  <p>  ‎In their published report, the NDA concluded that it is in the best interest of children with additional needs to transition to primary school with their age cohort, rather than being held back with children of a younger age.

For example, there are weekly transfers from the National Reception Centre (NRC) - where new arrivals are orientated when they arrive in the country. </p><p>In addition, individuals and families request transfers for a variety of reasons and IPAS facilitates those requests as appropriate and where possible. These transfers are more difficult in the current context of extremely limited available accommodation. </p><p>Currently, newly arrived international protection applicants are allocated to Citywest transit hub and once new accommodation is available, they will be transferred. </p><p>In the context of the current crisis, some of the emergency accommodation that comes on-stream is very short-term in nature and necessitates transferring people to alternative accommodation when it's use for IPAS expires. In the same manner, when accommodation comes on-stream, IPAS will arrange transfers for international protection applicants to that accommodation. </p><p>The accommodation situation is currently very fluid and necessitates international protection applicants be moved, on occasion, to a number of different locations. IPAS works to minimise this as they understand the disruption this causes to international protection applicants. However, unfortunately, it has been necessary on some occasions. </p><p>I trust this information clarifies the matter, Deputy.</p></reply>

The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed a commendable level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s response to the Ukraine crisis is governed by the EU Temporary Protection Directive (<b>Council Directive 2001/55/EC</b>).The European Commission activated the Directive on 2 March 2022 and on 4<sup></sup>March, the Council unanimously adopted the Decision giving those fleeing war in Ukraine the right to temporary protection. Under the Directive, Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection have rights, which include but are not limited to access to suitable accommodation,  necessary assistance in terms of social welfare and means of subsistence, if they do not have sufficient resources, as well as for medical care etc. We will continue to deliver a humanitarian response to the needs of Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs) and those seeking International Protection.</p><p>Accommodation for new arrivals will continually need to be found by the State throughout the Autumn/Winter period as my Department expects daily arrivals from Ukraine and those seeking international protection to continue.

This is the equivalent to the population of Waterford City and is due to increase.</p><p>For large-scale moves, such as the proposed move the Deputy has raised, my Department endeavours to provide as much advance notice as possible and is very mindful of the impact that all such moves have on those affected.  That particular planned move of BOTPs from Killarney did not proceed. My Department worked intensively to source alternative accommodation in the area for those affected. I can also confirm that officials within my Department have been in touch with the families to let them know about accommodation arrangements. </p><p>I trust this information is of assistance.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. </p>  <p>  To date, more than 53,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 42,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State. </p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, my Department has contracted in excess of 33,000 beds to accommodate Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs) in more than 500 settings including hotels, guesthouses, B&amp;Bs, hostels, commercial self-catering accommodation and certain other repurposed settings. The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p>  <p>  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues. </p>  <p>  The Government is resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine, and huge efforts are being made to source facilities that will provide those arriving in Ireland with safety and shelter. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that my officials confirm that the company which compiled the list shared by the Deputy has been contacted a number of times by my officials on an ongoing basis in recent weeks and months in relation to provision of accommodation for both Ukrainian Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection and International Protection applicants.</p>  <p>  Properties offered to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are evaluated in terms of value for money, location and size. Not all properties are suitable.  Larger properties are currently being prioritised because of the need to accommodate large groups of BOTPs and because it is difficult to maintain adequate oversight of large numbers of contracts for smaller properties.</p>  <p>  I trust this information is of assistance.</p></reply>

A full, detailed response issued to the constituent on 13th October 2022.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to thousands of families to help with the cost of early learning and childcare. There are two types of subsidies available under the Scheme: </p><p><b>-  Universal Subsidies</b>are available to all families with children between 24 weeks and 15 years of age. This subsidy is not means tested and currently provides &euro;0.50 per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.  </p><p><b>-  Income Assessed Subsidies</b>are available to families with children aged 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested, and will be calculated based on the applicant&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The rate will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational status, and the number of children in a family.  </p><p>Officials in my Department have contacted Pobal in relation to the correspondence raised by your constituent. Pobal have reviewed the case and advised that the decrease in subsidy is due to a rise in the household&rsquo;s reckonable income from the year 2020 to 2021.  The maximum income threshold for an income-related subsidy is &euro;60,000. As the new reckonable income figure is over this threshold the children have all been awarded a subsidy rate of &euro;0.50 per hour for 45 hours.  </p><p>It is worth noting that from January 2023, all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive a minimum hourly subsidy of &euro;1.40 through the NCS.  </p><p>Any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under the Scheme, will see an increase in their subsidy. This includes those who receive a subsidy based on an Income Assessed application. The amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The amount of increase individual families will see in their subsidy per hour, will differ depending on their current rate.  </p></reply>

From the beginning of 2022 to date, over 11,300 people have arrived in Ireland seeking protection. As of 12th of October, there are 15,983 people accommodated in International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) accommodation and of that total 3,396 are children.</p>  <p>  These figures are in addition to the arrival of over 53,000 Ukrainian Nationals of whom over 42,000 are seeking accommodation assistance from DCEDIY as a result of the war in Ukraine. It's important to note that at this point in 2021, there were roughly 7,500 people in IPAS accommodation.</p>  <p>  The pressure on the State to accommodate over 57,000 people currently has led to significant shortages particularly for the international protection cohort.</p>  <p>  The manner in which accommodation is sought by this Department is as follows:</p>  <p>  In the medium term, the request for tender (RFT), published on 18 January 2022, seeks to procure additional accommodation for singles, couples and families seeking international protection.  The RFT encourages tenders from not-for-profit organisations in the delivery of related services. The 2022 tender process for International Protection Accommodation Service accommodation that provides for more own-door accommodation for protection applicants has begun to deliver some capacity recently. 10 new identified contracts/properties that, subject to contract, are expected to result in additional bed spaces. The tender was re-advertised on 6 October with a response deadline of 8 November and hopes to bring more capacity into the fold. </p>  <p>  Emergency accommodation offers are pursued as they arise. Expressions of interest through newspaper advertisements are also utilised to generate addition offers of capacity and at times the Department has 'cold called' accommodation providers to source accommodation.   </p>  <p>  The Department tries to ensure a co-operative approach to accommodation sourcing with Local Authorities rather than a competitive one. </p>  <p>  The Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Local Authorities to ensure that there is no encroachment on Local Authority sourced homeless accommodation.  It does not procure individual houses, except where they can accommodate 15 people or more, or apartments for that reason.</p>  <p>  With respect to the Ukraine crisis response, the Department shares information weekly with the Local Authorities on accommodation due to commence for Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs) and advises also on IPAS accommodation as it becomes available through briefing of local elected representatives and briefing documents. </p></reply>

Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme and it is the new Core Funding Scheme -  worth &euro;259m in its first year - that allows to State to move to an increasingly publicly managed sector.</p><p>To date, 91% - well over 4,000 providers - have signed up to Core Funding. This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff, and a commitment not to increase fees.</p><p>Under the Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement, the conditions of Core Funding are set out, many of which relate to admissions policies. For example, Partner Services must contract to the ECCE programme and/or the NCS in the 2022/23 programme year and offer ECCE/NCS to all eligible children, where appropriate (for example, a service registered with Tusla as a Pre-school Sessional Service only is not required to offer NCS). In relation to the NCS, this requirement includes offering income assessed, universal and in particular &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; NCS arrangements to all eligible children up to the age of 15. If a parent/guardian chooses not to avail of ECCE and/or NCS, the Partner Service must be able to show they offered the parent/guardian the option to avail of ECCE and/or NCS and a record of the their wish not to do so. </p><p>Other relevant and new clauses contained in the Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement include: -  Partner Services must publish and distribute to users of the service a &ldquo;Parent Statement&rdquo; which provides information on the operation of ECCE and/or NCS in the service.-  Partner Services will neither request nor accept any donations, voluntary or otherwise from parents/guardians, in respect of the ELC/SAC services being provided. -  Partner Services will not charge any non-refundable deposits to parents/guardians in the respect of their ELC/SAC service where the parent/guardian takes up the service for which the deposit was paid.</p><p>Further developments to Core Funding are expected in Year 2 of the Scheme. These developments will be informed by operation of the Scheme in Year 1.</p><p>A list of Partner Services is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/together-for-better/.</p><p>I would also note that a review of the ECCE programme is currently underway in preparation for putting the ECCE programme on a statutory footing.  The review will consider issues of accessibility and inclusivity, and will inform future decisions on a universal legal entitlement to preschool. </p><p>I would encourage any parent who has questions relation to early learning and childcare to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee who can provide support and guidance, contact details available here: myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc.</p></reply>

Information on the report was made available to all Departments, State Agencies and national Traveller and Roma organisations represented on the NTRIS Steering Committee.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future recognises that there is a need for greater diversity and gender equality in local government, and commits to empowering local authorities to encourage improved gender and ethnic mix in local elections.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the &lsquo;Different Paths, Shared Experiences&rsquo; report aim to improve the participation of ethnic minority women in local politics and so are consistent with those commitments. The recommendations are wide-ranging and are relevant to a number of Government Departments, to political parties, local authorities, training organisations and wider civil society. </p>  <p>  Some recommendations are already in train. For example, in the area of combating racism, prejudice and bigotry, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister of Justice is developing new legislation to deal with hate crime while a National Plan Against Racism has recently been finalised which I will be submitting shortly for consideration by the Government.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the report recommendations will be examined in the preparation of new strategies being developed by my Department to replace the three equality strategies currently under review: the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the Migrant Integration Strategy.</p>  <p>  Finally, I should note that my Department provides core funding to one of the report sponsors, the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum (NTWF), which seeks to empower Traveller women in working towards full (gender) equality and to support them in taking leadership roles within their own and the wider community. Additional funding is being made available under the Dormant Account Fund plan, which is subject to approval by the Department of Rural and Community Development, to allow the NTWF to progress a number of specific report recommendations and to support the provision of training, both for Traveller women and for elected officials. </p></reply>

Some aspects were identified that would benefit from the consideration and views of Members who have direct experience of the Oireachtas. These include: how constituent representation should be provided for; how membership of Oireachtas committees should be dealt with; and, more broadly, should maternity leave for Members mirror the full entitlement of employees. </p>  <p>  At my request, I met in January with the Chair of the Women&rsquo;s Parliamentary Caucus, Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Loughlin, and the Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, Deputy Ivana Bacik, to discuss Maternity and Paternity Leave for Councillors and Maternity Leave for Members of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  I wrote again, in May 2022 to Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin, enclosing an information note for Members of the Irish Women&rsquo;s Parliamentary Caucus outlining the specific legal and operational issues in relation to the introduction of a scheme of maternity leave for Members of the Oireachtas, set out above, which would benefit from their input. I suggested that this could be circulated to all Members of the Caucus, and that my Department would develop a confidential survey through which their views could be provided. I offered that my Department&rsquo;s officials could brief a meeting of the Caucus working group examining this matter. </p>  <p>  In June my Department circulated the information note and a survey to the 59 current Members of the Caucus, which was available for response until the end of July.

Regrettably, Mr. Maguire failed to engage with the provider for some time, only contacting them in January 2022.

This measure excludes postgraduate students who receive the Special Rate of grant as they have their tuition fee contribution paid up to &euro;6,270. For these postgraduate students, they will receive the once-off extra maintenance payment for all student maintenance grant recipients, also to be paid by the end of 2022. Full time PhD student funded through an award by IRC or SFI will receive a once off increase in their stipend of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  Students can determine their eligibility for the Grant at susi.ie/eligibility/income/. This provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  For postgraduate students experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p>  <p>  Overall, the cost of living package, to take effect before the end of 2022, will include:</p>  <p>  - A once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees initiative;</p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year;</p>  <p>  The state financial support of &euro;1,000 in the student contribution relates to my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees schemes where the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible Irish and EU undergraduate higher education students who are pursuing an approved course of study at an approved higher education institution. All students eligible for the free fees schemes receive state support whereby the State pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution (currently &euro;3,000 per annum).</p>  <p>  Students attending postgraduate courses are not eligible for the free fees schemes and pay tuition fees as determined by the institution attended. Therefore the once off student contribution reduction of &euro;1,000 in 22/23 cannot apply to students undertaking a course of postgraduate study. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous institutions and therefore it is a matter for individual institutions to determine the rate of tuition fees for postgraduate academic programmes.</p></reply>

The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. However, once a student progresses to a course at a higher level or completes the equivalent period of study on a new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. Article 15(7) of the Student Grant Scheme 2022 refers.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2022, the awarding authority SUSI has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances, such as serious certified illness, which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams in line with guidelines drawn up by the Minister.</p>  <p>  SUSI treats each application for repeat funding on a case-by-case basis and it is it is a matter for the individual student to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that there were exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

As the total household reckonable income was calculated to be over the income threshold for PLC but under the maximum threshold for funding at undergraduate level his application was finalised, and he was awarded 100% rate of Student Contribution/50% Tuition Fees (whichever applies). An Award letter advising him of this was sent on 7 October 2022.</p></reply>

Specifically, to your question, the encouragement and support of women to pursue a career in farming has been reflected through my Department's policies across Higher Education, Further Education, and within the Apprenticeship system.</p><p>One of the five overarching objectives of the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025</i>is &quot;Apprenticeship for All&quot;. In other words, ensuring that the profile of the apprenticeship population more closely reflects the profile of the general population. By December 2021, there were a total of 1,535 female apprentices, up from 60 in 2016 and only 665 at the end of 2019.</p><p>This increase is mainly due to the expansion of apprenticeship into new areas. Many of these new programmes are in occupations that have greater gender balance in the workplace such as financial services where 52% of participants are female across the four apprenticeships in the sector. Women also feature more strongly in the new apprenticeships in the hospitality, healthcare, property, sales, biopharma and ICT sectors. However, it is also important to note that female representation in craft apprenticeship has doubled in the last two and a half years.</p><p>The Action Plan contains a number of key deliverables designed to secure significantly greater diversity by:</p><p>- including the voice of under-represented cohorts in apprenticeship:</p><p>- putting in place an inclusive apprenticeship access and delivery structure; and</p><p>- monitoring and assessing targets and developing appropriate interventions.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship</i>to incentivise the uptake:</p><p>- A new Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice per annum was made available from January 2022. Its introduction meant that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through this employer grant.</p><p>- A new gender-based bursary for apprenticeship employers has also been launched. The bursary, which is worth &euro;2,666, is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022.</p><p>Information on apprenticeship was included on the CAO website for the first time for CAO 2022. This is expected to make a significant contribution to showing the range of learning and qualification options for school leavers. As part of this landmark change, a freephone helpline has been introduced for learners, parents and guidance counsellors to provide information on apprenticeship, including how to find an employer. The helpline supplements the existing guidance counsellor service at post-primary and further education and training levels.</p><p>Eleven new apprenticeship programmes were launched between 2020 and 2022, despite the pandemic, with further programme development approved for progression in areas including farming and horticulture, and a number of others at the initial proposal stage.</p><p>Teagasc received approval from the Apprenticeship Council (now the National Apprenticeship Alliance) to develop 5 apprenticeships: Farm Technician (Level 6), Farm Manager (Level 7), Sportsturf Management (Level 6), Horticulture (Level 6) and Stud Farm Assistant Management (Level 7).</p><p>There has also been a specific focus on female participation as part of the Generation Apprenticeship national promotional campaign. SOLAS ran a media campaign over three weeks in January 2021 promoting the apprenticeship route and celebrating diversity and the 1,000th female apprentice.</p><p>Under the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025</i>, targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance. This will ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the development of the apprenticeship system.</p><p>Within the Higher Education sector existing programmes to increase and encourage women to pursue a career in farming through education and agriculture courses include Springboard+ and Human Capital Initiative (HCI) Pillar 1.</p><p>Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities to the employed, unemployed and returners at NFQ level 6 to level 9 in areas of identified skills need, all of these areas demonstrate the responsiveness of the higher education sector to advances in technology and changes in our environment. Springboard+ 2022 is providing 75 places on 3 courses for the 2022/23 academic year. These include Diploma in Food and Agri-business, Postgraduate Diploma in Innovative and Sustainable Agriculture and MSc Ag Innovation.</p><p>Human Capital Initiative (HCI) Pillar 1 provides for Graduate Conversion Courses in a range of courses, building on the experience from ICT Conversion Courses under Springboard. There is one course on offer under HCI P1, the Postgraduate Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Sustainable Agri-Food Production providing 20 places.</p><p>Human Capital Initiative Pillar 3, Innovation and Agility aims to ensure that courses in areas of skills needs demonstrate innovative methods of teaching and delivery, which will include flexibility in course provision. HCI Pillar 3 will deliver 24 projects in higher education institutions, 19 of which involve collaborations between institutions. One of these projects is related to Agri-tech.</p><p>The South East Technological University led AMASE: Additive Manufacturing Advancing the South East project will develop and deliver a new innovative, agile, and learner-centric Additive Manufacturing NFQ Level 7 Degree programme incorporating 5 no. Embedded Awards for upskilling employees in Industry. It proposes to co-design and co-deliver an innovative education and agile training platform to address these well identified and unmet education and training needs. Designed to specifically prepare individuals to be proficient in the design and implementation of advanced additive manufacturing systems for application across a multiplicity of key industrial sectors including the Agri-Tech sector.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme and be attending an approved course.</p>  <p>  In the context of limited public funding and competing priorities, Free Fees funding is currently targeted at full-time students undertaking study on an approved course in approved publicly funded institutions; part-time courses are therefore not approved courses under the Free Fees schemes.</p>  <p>  In considering the feasibility of introducing a scheme to provide for free tuition fees for part-time learners, it is important to note that higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of part time tuition fees, the courses offered, and the number of students enrolled on such courses are solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria. Part-time tuition fees are also subject to review by the institutions themselves. In this regard there are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations in introducing a new measure to support part-time students.</p>  <p>  In May, I published Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education. I identified the need to address cost as a barrier to higher education. Funding measures will be pursued through the Estimates process and the Deputy will be aware that I have already introduced a significant package of measures to support students as part of Budget 2023. Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p>  <p>  In the medium term, a focus on lifelong learning, supporting part-time and blended provision and micro-credentials will facilitate the ongoing adaptation of skills to areas of particular need and allow more flexible access by more diverse learners to higher education.</p>  <p>  Through Funding the Future we identify five priority strands of work on which progress will be made. Strand 5 will consider options to address costs as a barrier to higher education and improve student supports. Work under this strand will inform the progressive implementation of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, within the overall context of Government policy towards costs of living and other relevant strategies including those related to access and participation in education. Subject to resources available to the Department, I intend to do this through enhancement of student supports and annual reviews of the cost of going to higher education. Measures in this area will take account of the strategic priorities set out in the Student Grant Scheme Review, including increasing supports for postgraduate study. Over time, the annual options assessment will consider progress on strategic priorities, including the extension of supports to enable more flexible forms of learning including blended/online and part-time.</p></reply>

As apprentices are employees, the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employers in any area or sector.</p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners, to achieve a target of 10,000 annual registrations across a wide range of programmes by 2025.</p><p>Meeting these targets requires a responsive apprenticeship system that provides a strong value proposition for employers and potential apprentices, is attractive and easy to engage with, and which delivers high standards and sought after qualifications.</p><p>We have made important progress to date. Last year saw a record 8,607 registrations. This is an increase of nearly 40% compared to 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; year. This is a strong foundation on which to build as we advance delivery of the Action Plan, in order to embed apprenticeship as a preferred route to skills development.</p><p>Regarding the development of apprenticeship and upskilling educational and or retraining facilities:</p><p>-  Capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities.</p><p>-  Further funding of &euro;17m has been provided to SOLAS and the HEA to address Covid-related backlogs, &euro;6 million of which is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved</p><p>-  To ensure that there is capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022, with further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year.</p><p>Specifically, the funding includes:</p><p>-  The development of two large training hubs dedicated to electrical training for the next three years;</p><p>-  Expansion of electrical, plumbing, and carpentry programmes across further and higher education;</p><p>-  The construction of electrical workshops at Kilkenny and Carlow ETB and the development of a training facility in Donegal;</p><p>-  A call for additional phase 2 capacity in craft programmes that include carpentry, plumbing and refrigeration Expansion of electrical apprenticeships in ATU Donegal and MTU Kerry.</p><p>&euro;30m in additional once-off funding has been secured for apprenticeship in 2023. This will provide for 4,500 new registrations across both craft and consortia-led programmes. The majority will be on craft programmes, which will provide strong support to the delivery of Government goals under Housing for All, climate action, and retrofitting.</p><p>I am confident that these measures will contribute to the further development of the apprenticeship system, so that it continues to make a valued contribution to our skills response.  </p><p>Craft apprenticeship programmes are demand-led &ndash; there are no restrictions on the number of apprentices that can be registered in any single year. With strong registrations continuing more apprentices are being added to the waiting list.</p><p>At the end of September there were 8,054 apprentices waiting for off the job training. This is down from nearly 12,000 apprentices who were waiting last August which shows that significant progress has been made.</p><p>Officials in my Department are in continuous engagement with SOLAS, the HEA and other partners. As strong registrations on craft programmes continue, SOLAS are working to provide further places across the system to address the high numbers of apprentices who need to undertake their off-the-job learning phases. With the commitment of a further &euro;17.2m in capital investment into 2023, this need for increased capacity continues to be actively managed. The funding means that SOLAS are able to continue the progress already made to address those programmes with the highest numbers of apprentices waiting to be placed.</p></reply>

Following an extensive economic assessment undertaken through the European Commission's DG Reform programme, &euro;307 million has been identified as the level of funding required to address the current underfunding in higher education.</p><p>My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education. Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole. This process is critical to enabling a number of key reforms, protecting quality and ensuring a fit for purpose sector which is enabled to evolve and adapt to future challenges.</p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that implementing the funding and reform framework will improve quality of outcomes from tertiary education, will strengthen the agility and responsiveness of higher education and will enhance the reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system internationally, including in international rankings.</p><p>The reforms and strategic outcomes identified by Government as a priority are as follows:</p><p>- Create unified knowledge and skills system which is balanced and integrated</p><p>- Strengthen representation in higher education for underrepresented groups</p><p>- Enhance quality by reducing the ratio of students to academic staff to comparable EU and OECD norms</p><p>- Reinforce alignment of sector with skills needs of the country &ndash; including those needed to deliver essential public services and meet national goals</p><p>- Drive forward a culture of lifelong learning</p><p>Budget 2023 includes an allocation of &euro;40 million as an important initial step to address the sustainable funding of higher education as laid out in Funding the Future. This is a full year cost and an increase in the level of baseline funding from the 2022 estimates.</p><p>It is envisaged that the adoption of a sustainable funding model will enable steps to be taken to move back towards European and OECD norms in terms of staffing ratios. It will also support the sector in moving away from the scale of use of more precarious forms of employment arrangement, subject to agreement by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Separately from the &euro;40 million allocation under Funding our Future, Budget 2023 provides for an increase of &euro;500 in the PhD stipend.  This will apply to all researchers who are in receipt of the stipend from SFI or the IRC.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-18a.1501.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101800096#WRDD04200"><p>The importance of apprenticeships in society, both now and into the future, has never been more apparent than it is today. The &lsquo;<i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo;</i>sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners. Expansion to date has widened the impact of apprenticeship to areas of skills shortage such as engineering, technology skills, logistics, and fintech.</p><p>Apprenticeship has undergone transformation over the past 6 years. There is a clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people progressing in their career, school leavers, and career changers. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years.</p><p>The simple fact is that apprenticeship only exists in areas where there is a demand for skills. They are not approved otherwise. However apprentice jobs can only exist where employers provide those jobs &ndash; and the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship</i>sets out to support employers to engage with apprenticeship as a key mechanism for building a highly skilled workforce. People learn in different ways and we want to make sure that everyone is aware apprenticeship can be for them as a route to a qualification into the future.</p><p>The actions set out in the plan will deliver clarity for school-leavers, jobseekers, and career changers on the wide range of available apprenticeships. Furthermore, it will put a structure in place to ensure that the apprentice population will more closely reflect the general population &ndash; through targeted supports for under-represented groups and making sure that there is ongoing representation from those groups to advise on specific actions into the future.</p><p>Empowering people from under-represented and marginalised sections of society to take their rightful place in the system is vital to the success of apprenticeship.  Apprenticeship can provide them with a clear route to not only a job, but to a valued qualification and a clear career path, instilling hope and direction that may not otherwise have been readily apparent.</p><p>Funding has been secured in Budget 2023 to expand the Access to Apprenticeship (ATA) initiative beyond its current two locations and an apprentice bursary/support scheme will be established to fund up to 100 apprentices per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage and who are from target groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma.</p><p>Both measures will be advanced through the Equity of Access sub-committee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance.</p><p>Government will also ensure that the public sector plays its part by delivering high quality public sector employment and training opportunities, underpinning the ongoing reform of our public service.</p><p>The workplace is changing and the response to Covid-19 has accelerated digital transformation, changing the nature and capabilities required for occupations. Certain sectors were greatly affected, particularly aviation and hospitality and may take a long time to recover to anywhere near normal levels. Other sectors including construction and the green economy are forecast to recover more quickly and expand. A significant number of people will need to reskill to find alternative employment and to prepare for the new employment opportunities that will emerge &ndash; apprenticeship provides a rapid route to gaining those skills.</p><p>The &lsquo;<i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship&rsquo;</i>has been live for over one year now and already I can report to you that as a result of a &euro;34 million investment under Budget 2022 targeting the expansion of apprenticeship, including the development of new programmes and addressing the Covid-related backlogs, tangible progress has already been made.</p><p>For example, eight new apprenticeship programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic &ndash;</p><p>- Arboriculture,</p><p>- Equipment Systems Engineer,</p><p>- Healthcare Assistant,</p><p>- Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate,</p><p>- Recruitment Executive,</p><p>- Sales,</p><p>- Scaffolding,</p><p>- Supply Chain Associate.</p><p>In 2022 more were added &ndash;</p><p>- Bar Manager,</p><p>- Wind Turbine Maintenance and</p><p>- Transport Operations &amp;amp; Commercial Driving.</p><p>- Cybersecurity</p><p>This brings the total number of available programmes to 66 and will help address areas of severe skills shortage. Programme development has been approved for progression in areas such as</p><p>- farming,</p><p>- horticulture,</p><p>- engineering </p><p>- finance,</p><p>- manufacturing,</p><p>- construction,</p><p>- ICT, and a number of others at the initial proposal stage.</p><p>An additional &euro;30 million investment has been secured under Budget 2023. This funding will provide for an additional estimated:- </p><p>- 4,000 additional places on craft apprenticeship training; </p><p>- 500 additional places on consortia&mdash;led programmes; </p><p>- The payment of allowances to all craft apprentices while on off-the-job training phases, including the additional 4,000 apprentices.</p><p>Significant financial supports have also been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>- The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 41 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the recently passed Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p><p>By 2025, regardless of the sector, apprenticeship will be a clear choice for people looking for a new career, qualification, or return to work option across all areas of the economy.  We want apprenticeship to be at the heart of the conversation when employers are looking at ways to recruit staff. A minimum of 10,000 new apprentice jobs will be available every year &ndash; and will be filled by learners of all ages and experience, and at least 750 of those will be in the public sector.</p></reply>

Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.

Our approach to addressing these challenges is firmly rooted in collaborative partnership with enterprise and other stakeholders, and is central to our economic and social ambitions, as borne out in the 2021 Economic Recovery Plan.</p><p>Skillnet, the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora network all work closely with my Department to foster engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between the education and training system, the enterprise agencies, and enterprise representatives in relation to skills priorities.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s project with the OECD to review Ireland&rsquo;s skills approach has seen a comprehensive review throughout the year of these issues.Clear areas of focus emerging include our need to have more dynamic, granular, real-time data to inform how we respond rapidly to industry's needs, particularly across digital skills demands in all sectors; our intent to continue focus on short, flexible and blended skilling options for individuals entering and for people transitioning in the workforce; and, our ambition to progress ease of navigability through options for skilling and ensuring individualised, continuous learning journeys are enabled, encouraged and as easy as possible to undertake.</p><p>The effectiveness and impact of the whole of the tertiary education system &ndash; FET, HE &amp;amp; Apprenticeship &ndash; is enhanced when education and training provision, as well broader upskilling and reskilling opportunities, are informed by the experience, insights and expertise of the enterprise sector. We will only ensure the best possible skills and talent pipeline through working together and continuing to challenge each other as partners. </p><p>In relation to the areas of science, innovation and research specifically, I am seeking to further momentum in fostering talent to match the dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape of our economy. For example, <i>Impact 2030: Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy</i>was published earlier this year. It reaffirms that talent lies at the heart of the Irish research and innovation ecosystem. For future national prosperity, Ireland must be a great place to be a researcher and innovator, and it must attract the best people from all backgrounds, domestically and internationally. </p><p>Over the course of the strategy, students will be supported to gain the skills and experience that will enable them to engage with, and respond to, the latest developments in research and innovation. A consistent research student experience will be promoted and work will be undertaken to ensure that the research community is reflective of society and provides opportunities for all.</p><p>Researchers will be supported with the right skills development and career opportunities so that they can make their maximum contribution. Career pathways will be improved, starting with a deeper understanding of the nature of the demand for research talent. Researchers&rsquo; transversal skills will be enhanced so that they can make the greatest possible difference across enterprise, the public sector, civic society organisations and internationally.</p></reply>

The most recent projections of full-time enrolment in higher education predict that enrolments will rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. Work is also ongoing on an updated set of enrolment projections for higher education, which will further assist in this capacity-building programme of work. My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates, as a number of variables can impact graduate output in any one year. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. Central to shaping these strategies is the partnership approach between the Further and Higher Education system and Government, Industry, the National Skills Council, the National Training Fund Advisory Group, the Regional Skills Fora and the Apprenticeship Council.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered- an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pre-pandemic year.</p>  <p>  The National Skills Council (NSC) within its remit advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high-level trends identified at recent NSC meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then used to formulate our skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue then and produces the graduates the workforce needs with the skills that our economy and society require. </p></reply>

The agreement reached with the medical schools will create additional places in medical programmes over five years, with the number of additional places climbing to 120 in September 2023, and up to 200 by 2026. </p>  <p>  Further permanent additional places were also announced in July, including 135 places on nursing programmes commencing from September 2022. Significant engagement is ongoing between my Department and the Department of Health in relation to substantial further expansion in nursing places. We continue to work closely with the Chief Nursing Officer, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and the Higher Education institutions on the sustainable introduction of places on nursing programmes.</p>  <p>  My officials are also actively engaging with the Department of Health, the HSE and other relevant Health and Social Care Profession stakeholders to ensure that we can continue to deliver graduates with the skills necessary to support our healthcare system and support the strategic workforce planning by the health sector. The availability of appropriate placements and placement supports is a key enabler of this expansion, and engagement across my Department, the Department of Health, HSE and Higher Education Sector is ongoing. The Higher Education Authority are currently developing a request for Expressions of Interest to issue to the sector targeted at specific areas including healthcare.</p></reply>

This is not an &lsquo;add-on&rsquo; or part of a wish-list. This is an entitlement for everyone who works and studies at our third level institutions.</p><p>Surveys of staff and student&rsquo;s experience of sexual violence and harassment in Irish higher education institutes were conducted last year, with the two survey findings published last January. Since the publication of the survey findings, my department has been working with the HEA and key stakeholders to develop an implementation plan which represents a comprehensive and ambitious response to the recommendations contained in the two survey reports. I launched this implementation plan (<i>Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Higher Education Institutions - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 2022-2024) </i>last Thursday. It contains 19 actions which will be delivered between 2022 and 2024. I have also recently secured an additional &euro;1.5m in funding to appoint Sexual Violence and Harassment (SVH) Prevention and Response Managers in our HEIs who will lead on the important changes we are making.</p><p>In August, I launched the findings of a <i>Report on the National Survey of Staff Experiences of Bullying in Irish Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)</i>conducted by the specialist DCU Anti-Bullying Centre. This report presents the findings of an anonymous online survey, commissioned by my department, examining the prevalence and impact of workplace bullying among staff in 20 publicly-funded HEIs in Ireland. The survey of staff experiences of bullying in higher education was conducted in late 2021. A total of 3,835 HEI staff responses were analysed.</p><p>The survey report includes a number of recommendations, which will inform future policy decisions to tackle workplace bullying within higher education institutions. Some of these recommendations include:</p><p>- awareness, education and training;</p><p>- implementing evidence-based programmes (with a focus on Equality Diversity and Inclusion);</p><p>- supporting targets of bullying and bystanders;</p><p>- developing anti bullying policies in consultation with employees; and</p><p>- ongoing research to further explore and monitor the prevalence of workplace bullying in HEIs</p><p>My Department is currently working with DCU&rsquo;s National Anti-Bullying Centre to progress work on a student survey on bullying which I plan to launch in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Deputy will also be familiar with the &lsquo;Speak Out&rsquo; tool which my Department has funded. 'Speak Out' is the Online Anonymous Reporting Tool for Sexual Harassment and Violence across higher education institutions which I launched in October 2021.  The online and anonymous reporting platform provides a mechanism for the reporting of incidents of bullying; cyberbullying; harassment; discrimination; hate crime; coercive behaviour or control; stalking; assault; sexual harassment; sexual assault or rape. The project has been rolled out across 18 higher education institutions throughout the last academic year for students, staff and visitors. This project is a ground-breaking initiative which is underpinned by an ethos of cross-institutional collaboration in response to such incidences within higher education institutions.</p><p>The primary goal of the various surveys is to create a basis for the development of evidence based policy. We have an expert Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment in HEIs in place which is providing advice on appropriate policy responses in this area. The intention is to establish a working group, under the auspices of the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, to review the findings of the two bullying surveys and develop actions to achieve our shared goal to develop a more inclusive organisational culture for both staff and students in Irish higher education institutions.</p><p>I have been very clear that the tertiary education and training sector must lead the way in changing cultures, behaviours and practices across society to ensure that bullying, sexual violence and harassment are not tolerated. I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required, listening to survivors and working in collaboration to achieve justice for victims and a cultural norm where bullying is not tolerated. </p></reply>

It recognises the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.</p>  <p>  Delivery of the Plan is supported by the PATH programme, which provides a range of supports to priority groups including bursaries under the 1916 scholarship scheme and support for people from target groups in accessing initial teacher education.  The programme also supports clusters of higher education institutions in attracting under-represented students. PATH will receive an additional dedicated investment of &euro;35 million over the course of the plan. This year, funding will support new measures to strengthen Universal Design for students in higher education, including those with autism, and to enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education. </p>  <p>  We will provide an additional 50 Bursaries of &euro;5,000 each under the 1916 Bursary Fund,which supports the most socio-economically disadvantaged students from National Access Plan priority groups. We will allow 1916 Bursary holders retain their bursary if they wish to progress to Graduate Entry Medicine. We will provide an additional &euro;700,000 to enhance engagement between Higher Education Institutions with priority groups and create linkages with DEIS post-primary schools. This is also aimed at ensuring there are links with schools and to enhance a focus on Further Education to Higher Education transitions particularly for mature students.</p>  <p>   We are also considering the appointment of a PATH co-ordinator (for a three-year pilot basis) in the FET sector to support FE &ndash; HE transitions for priority groups with a particular focus on students from the Traveller and Roma communities. Finally, we will establish PATH 5, a three-year pilot of &euro;450,000 per year, to support access, participation and success for students from the Traveller and Roma communities. </p>  <p>  Since the establishment of my Department I have made improvements in the financial supports available to students under the Student Grant Scheme managed by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI). It assists circa 70,000 students annually to access third level education. I have continued this improvement in Budget 2023, to enable wider access by introducing a range of measures which will put more money in student&rsquo;s pockets and support participation in and access to tertiary education. </p>  <p>  These measures include increases to the student maintenance grant rates from January 2023 and a one off additional maintenance payments before Christmas, reductions to student contribution fees for apprentices, undergraduates and postgraduates. I also increased the allocation to the Student Assistance Fund, which helps so many students who continue to struggle financially, by &euro;8 million. </p>  <p>  These financial supports sit alongside a dedicated Fund for Students with Disabilities, which aims to ensure that students can participate fully in education, or on an equal basis with their peers.</p>  <p>  Details of these and other student financial supports are available at www.studentfinance.ie and I would encourage students to contact their Access Office in the third level institution attended for details of any further supports.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing through the Funding the Future Implementation structures to consider the potential to support students avail of more flexible learning opportunities  </p>  <p>  In addition, fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those in traditionally less well represented groups. FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised, and a number of financial supports may be available to learners to facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training. I would encourage people to make an appointment with their local Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), available in each Education and Training Boards (ETB) across the country free of charge, to discuss what supports may be available to them.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are employer led demand-driven educational and training programmes that aim to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. As apprentices are employees the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employer base in a sector.</p>  <p>  One of the five overarching objectives of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 is "Apprenticeship for All" by ensuring that the profile of the apprenticeship population will more closely reflect the profile of the general population. The Plan promotes general access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship by suggested targeted supports to encourage participation from under-represented groups including those with disabilities, women and those from ethnic minorities. </p></reply>

Registrations and renewals for persons resident outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network.  The allocation of appointments for registration and renewal with GNIB, for some 50 locations nationwide, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Any person registering for the first time is required to attend at their local registration office in person and, as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the demand for first-time registration appointments at its Burg Quay office, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 800 630) was introduced for customers.  So far this year, the Registration Office of my Department has issued and processed over 50,000 first time registration appointments. </p>  <p>  Additionally, if a non-EEA national is residing in the Dublin area and has an existing valid permission to be in the State, then they do not need to seek an appointment to attend in person to renew their permission. An online renewal facility was launched in July 2020 to processes renewals and there has been 173,000 approx. registrations renewed online since the facility was launched. There is currently a 3 week processing time for online renewal of permissions at present. All persons over the age of 16 are issued with an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) Card which displays details of the permission granted, the conditions attaching and the expiry date of the permission. </p>  <p>  I have also checked with EURAXESS Ireland who process PhD researcher Hosting Agreements on behalf of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  They have advised that they are not experiencing any significant delays and most applications are dealt with in a matter of days.</p>  <p>  Where a Non EEA National is in possession of an in date IRP card they are free to travel from, and return to, the State. However, when travelling abroad they should check for any visa requirements or other immigration requirements for their intended destination.</p>  <p>  If any non-EEA national PhD student has a particular concern on their individual immigration application, they can contact the Immigration Service Helpdesk by emailing immigrationsupport@justice.ie who will endeavour to assist.</p></reply>

A letter issued to the applicant on the 6 September 2022 outlines the reasons for this refusal. </p>  <p>  An appeals process, which is free of charge, is available which allows applicants, in the event of a refusal of the application at first instance, to address the factors which gave rise to that decision. An appeal was lodged in respect of this application on the 7 October 2022.  </p>  <p>  I can further advise that the visa application has been re-examined by a Visa Appeals Officer in the Visa Division. The Visa Appeals Officer has taken all the documentation and information submitted with the original application and with the appeal into consideration. The appeal has not been successful and the original decision to refuse the application was upheld. The reasons for the refusal of the appeal are outlined in the refusal letter of the 7 October 2022.</p>  <p>  All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary. Guidelines in this regard are posted on our website. Applicants that follow these guidelines have an improved prospect of receiving a positive decision at first instance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that should any person, who has been refused a visa, wishes to make another application at a future point, their application will be assessed on its own merits taking all relevant information into consideration at that time. Their prior immigration history is a matter of record but does not preclude them from seeking a visa in the future.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility (inisoireachtasmail@justice.ie) which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

We are confident that the victim-centred policy approach we are taking will encourage more victims to come forward which will, in turn, strengthen prosecutions and convictions.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences and Human Trafficking) Bill 2022, published in July, will put a revised National Referral Mechanism (NRM) on a statutory footing, making it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified, and access support. </p><p>The NRM is the framework through which the State fulfils its obligations to protect and promote the human rights of trafficking victims, working in partnership with civil society.</p><p>The proposed new NRM was approved by Government in May 2021 and is a key component in combatting human trafficking. It will provide for civil society groups that support victims to refer them for formal identification and will make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward and be identified so they can access all of the supports and resources that are available to them.</p><p>This is a clear demonstration of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to identify and support victims of this abhorrent crime and it will strengthen our international reputation in this area.</p><p>I also want to draw the Deputy's attention to the advanced work to develop a new National Action Plan on human trafficking.  </p><p>My Department has engaged with a working group to draft the new National Action Plan high-level goals and outcomes. A draft Action Plan has been prepared and I intend to engage in a further round of stakeholder consultations before the plan is finalised and submitted to Government for approval before the end of the year.</p><p>Other significant measures introduced in Ireland to combat trafficking, create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training, include -</p><p>The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff inindustries such as hospitality, airline, shipping and security who maycome into contact with trafficked persons; and </p><p>Increased funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased fundingdedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.</p><p>Furthermore, for the pastnumber of years, the Department of Justice has partnered with the UnitedNations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in Dublin onan annual campaign to raise awareness in society that victims oftrafficking can be found anywhere and can be hidden in plain sight and weare looking forward to building on this work with IOM.</p><p>The Third National Strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence that I recently launched contains an action to identify linkages between the implementation plan accompanying the Strategy, and the National Action Plan on human trafficking, as well as ensuring actions to prevent prostitution and combat trafficking for sexual exploitation are addressed in an integrated manner.</p></reply>

It is not a real time surveillance system but primarily a means of checking compliance with any conditions of temporary release.</p>  <p>  There are a number of ways of engaging with, and monitoring, people whether they are on probation, bail or on temporary early release. Electronic tagging, if it is to be used, should be considered in conjunction with these targeted supervision measures.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that while electronic tagging is not currently being used due to cost considerations and limited use, it is important that it has been provided for in legislation so that it can be activated if deemed necessary.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently approved the publication of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021, which is due for report stage in the D&aacute;il tomorrow. </p>  <p>  As drafted, this Bill includes provision for a court to order an electronic monitoring device for a convicted sex offender who is subject to a post-release supervision order or where a sex offender order includes a condition restricting the offender's movement, post release.</p>  <p>  The aim of this provision is to provide our courts with a range of appropriate tools and interventions to allow for monitoring of sex offenders in order to reduce any potential risk posed and to facilitate rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  There is some evidence that electronic monitoring can be effective in respect of sex offenders when used for a short duration in tandem with other interventions, such as probation supervision and this is what I am proposing in the Bill.</p>  <p>  As a technology, electronic monitoring has advanced over the years. I envisage therefore that a pilot scheme will be introduced to explore its costs and benefits once this new legislation is in place.  I will keep this matter under review.</p>  <p>  The operational details of how this will work will have to be carefully developed and take account of the costs and value for money, in the context of the technology&rsquo;s overall effectiveness, as well as the Council of Europe Guidelines.</p></reply>

As Minister, I cannot intervene in or comment on any operational matter, or on the allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that, in response to a number of incidents in the Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot area earlier this year, local Garda management immediately enhanced their high visibility policing presence together with the support and assistance of the DMR Regional Garda Public Order Unit (GNPOU) over the course of a number of weekends. This high visibility has continued to date.</p><p>I am also advised that earlier this year Garda management implemented and has continued a high profile policing presence plan to reassure the community and to secure confidence in policing in the area. This policing plan includes:</p><p>-  Additional high visibility pedal cycle patrols in the environs of the local shopping area;</p><p>-Additional mobile presence in the community;</p><p>-Support of the Regional and Divisional Roads Policing unit;</p><p>-Increased armed presence through patrolling by the Regional Support Unit and Armed Support Units;</p><p>-Patrols of open areas and the canal by the Garda Mounted units;</p><p>-Operation Pr&eacute;ach&aacute;n is also in operation since 20 August 2022, and focuses on tackling car related crime and anti-social behaviour. </p><p>Meetings have taken place between Dublin City Council and various local stakeholders, including a meeting between my Department, Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to look at the existing plans and structures in the area and build on those structures to deliver a safer environment for those living in the Cherry Orchard area.</p><p>The unprecedented funding of more than &euro;2 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated in Budget 2023 reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring our communities are safe and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be an effective, visible and proactive policing service.</p><p>A key strand in tackling anti-social behaviour is the new Local Community Safety Partnerships scheme which is currently being piloted. The Programme is designed to identify the issues causing communities to feel unsafe and to address them collaboratively. One of three pilot schemes is located in Dublin's North Inner City, and is chaired by Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;.</p><p>An additional allocation of &euro;6.7m was provided in Budget 2022 and another &euro;2.5m  in 2023 to ensure the delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy 2021 - 2027, which was launched in April 2021. One particular objective of this strategy is the expansion and deepening of the services offered to young people by the Youth Diversion Projects, which are fully funded by my Department. </p></reply>

The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

It is important to note, however, that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in the course of carrying out their duties.</p><p>Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda Operating Model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under 'A Policing Service for Our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations.</p></reply>

The Report contains a number of recommendations which relate to the issues raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The objective set for the Review from the outset was to ensure a balanced approach to the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection of good name and reputation, and the right of access to justice.  </p>  <p>  The Report is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and is the culmination of extensive work by my Department on a comprehensive review of the Defamation Act 2009 &ndash; including a wide-ranging public consultation, and a stakeholder symposium that brought together the media, academics, the legal profession, NGOs, and relevant State bodies. The Report considers in detail all the issues raised by submissions to the public consultation, examines relevant proposed, and implemented, reforms in other common law countries and at EU level, and sets out a range of recommendations for change.  The Report&rsquo;s key recommendations aim to: </p>  <p>- avoid disproportionate awards, and support more consistent, proportionate and predictable redress in defamation cases;</p>  <p>- ensure that an individual whose good reputation is unfairly attacked can avail of quicker, more efficient, better targeted redress, including in cases of online defamation; </p>  <p>- provide clearer protection for responsible public interest journalism and investigative reporting;</p>  <p>- significantly reduce unnecessary legal costs and delays, for all concerned;</p>  <p>- increase the use of ADR, and of prompt correction and apology, where mistakes are made; and</p>  <p>- introduce new measures to combat abuse.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation in the report is to introduce a new &lsquo;anti-SLAPP&rsquo; mechanism - referring to Strategic Law Suits against Public Participation - to allow a person to apply to court for summary dismissal of proceedings that he/she believes are a SLAPP. SLAPPs are legal proceedings, often without merit, whose main objective is not to succeed on the substantive issue claimed. Instead, they seek to deter debate or criticism by the defendant on matters of public interest, which is inconvenient to the plaintiff&rsquo;s interest, by generating disproportionate costs and burdens of litigation to intimidate and obstruct them.</p>  <p>  The Report also recommends that consideration should be given to the introduction of a &lsquo;serious harm test&rsquo; in the case of certain &lsquo;transient&rsquo; defamation claims (claims regarding a statement made in non-permanent form, in the course of providing or refusing retail services) to prevent frivolous or vexatious actions. </p>  <p>  The Defamation (Amendment) Bill is included in the Government&rsquo;s autumn Legislation Programme, and my Department is currently working on the General Scheme. </p></reply>

While AGS will from time to time express views on the effectiveness of proposals to introduce new criminal provisions or Garda powers, those views will be addressed through ongoing engagement and adaptation of the proposals.

Its role is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and social care professionals.</p>  <p>  CORU will open the Social Care Workers Register on the 30 November 2023. This will begin a 2-year transition period during which existing practitioners may apply to register with CORU. On 30 November 2025, the title 'Social Care Worker' will become a legally protected title in Ireland. This positive milestone will ensure all service users receive the highest standards of care and empower CORU to act when any deficiencies are identified.</p>  <p>  CORU has confirmed that the Open Training College (OTC) did not apply for approval of the programme titled Bachelor of Arts in Professional Social Care (Disability). CORU is aware that this programme is no longer offered by the OTC and would be considered a historical qualification. </p>  <p>  The 2005 Act currently provides that during the two-year transition period, an existing practitioner who has been practising the profession of social care work for a continuous two-year period out of the previous five years, and whose employer states that they meet the standards for that profession may be eligible for entry into the register. </p>  <p>  CORU remain available to support existing practitioners and provide guidance on the entry routes to the Social Care Workers Register.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank you for raising a matter of understandable concern.</p></reply>

The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p>  <p>  - Bed and board;</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  Costs not covered by the NHSS include those individually incurred for items like social activities, newspapers and hairdressing. This may also include medical services such as therapies and some medical equipment. A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that residents of nursing homes should enjoy the same levels of support and access to services as when they lived in their own homes. It is acknowledged that the reason they require 24 hour levels of support is due to their level of dependency, which in turn may require access to clinical services including hospital and other outpatient appointments in the community. The HSE provides for a level of Intermediate Care Vehicles, which are used predominantly for non-emergency transport between acute hospitals for admission and discharge purposes. They would be reserved for those who would need specific support in transport. In other cases, normal transport arrangements apply. These arrangements (e.g. wheelchair taxi) are normally funded by the individual.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, as set out above. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.

However, for some people under the age of 65 nursing homes are not an appropriate placement, and alternative, more sustainable supported living solutions are needed to give them greater independence and choice in their daily lives.  </p>  <p>  A range of services are being supported that can facilitate young people with serious disabilities live fuller, more independent lives.  Measures to prevent young persons from entering nursing homes continue to be supported through a range of services including respite, home support and personal assistance services.</p>  <p>  There is a clear Government commitment to reduce and provide a pathway to eliminate the practice of accommodating young people with serious disabilities in nursing homes.   In this context, work has been ongoing with the HSE to address nursing home care of people under 65 who wish to live elsewhere.   In 2021 this Government provided for a Pilot Scheme as part of the HSE National Service Plan (NSP) to enable 18 people, with an investment of &euro;3m, under the age of 65yrs to transition to their own home with support.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan (NSP) 2022 provided a further allocation of &euro;5.5 million in 2022 to support further transitions to more appropriate placements in the community.  Discussions on the HSE National Service Plan 2023 will commence shortly with the HSE and activity for 2023 will be determined in that context.</p></reply>

This report set out the capacity requirements for health-funded disability services for the period up to 2032 and it is intended to address the capacity deficits in a phased approach over this period. This reflects the obligation under the UNCRPD for progressive implementation of social, cultural and economic rights.</p><p>In order to drive the process of implementing the recommendations of the Capacity Review, a Working Group was set up to develop an Action Plan for Disability Services. This Group has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan, which will be an implementation plan for the first phase, is currently being finalised for approval.</p><p>In recent years, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services. This year, the overall Budget for disability services in 2023 will be &euro;2.4 billion, including a significant level of funding for specialist disability services. Building on the previous year, this is an unprecedented level of funding for Disability services. It follows substantial increases in the budget in 2021 and 2022; and reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening the funding provided for the disability sector and working to act to address the shortfalls identified in the Disability Capacity Review.  </p><p>The following increased funding has been provided for 2023. <table>    <tr>       <th>Funding</th>       <th>Measure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;109m</td>       <td>To support existing levels of service</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;4.3m</td>       <td>Digital Initiatives/Disability Awareness and Participation Fund</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;25m</td>       <td>Building Capacity (Core Services)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;39m</td>       <td>One off Costs associated with activity during Covid-19</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based voluntary organisations who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community. Details of the fund including its administration are being finalised.</p><p>The HSE, in preparing its National Service Plan, will examine how services, including relevant KPIs, can be progressed in 2023 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.</p></reply>

This significant investment will enable continued improvement for the HSE Mental Health care programme over next year.</p>  <p>  As I also indicated in my reply, &euro;750,000 was provided in Budget 2023 to allow the HSE to support counselling psychology training places. This funding demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthen access to psychology training. This is a new and specific initiative, prioritised by the HSE to enhance mental health care overall.  As happens each year following the Budget,  detailed discussions are progressing between the Department and HSE to improve Mental Health care arising from Budget 2023 and in the context of preparing the HSE Service Plan for next year. </p>  <p>  I re-iterate my understanding that the Minister for Education and her Department very much value the work of all educational psychologists across the education system and that they are working intensively to find a positive resolution for the issue of fees for trainee educational psychologists.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Education and other Government Departments as required on wider workforce planning issues for health and social care professionals, including on future planning in terms of psychology education, training, and placement.

It was developed in recognition of the growing need for a co-ordinated policy response to the increasing problem of obesity in Ireland and the increasing burden placed on individuals and society.  </p><p>OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  It recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  Childhood obesity is a key priority under OPAP, as is reducing the inequalities seen in obesity rates, where children (and adults) from lower socioeconomic groups have higher levels of obesity.</p><p>Implementation of the OPAP is overseen by a cross-sectoral and cross-Departmental group, the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) chaired by the Department of Health and established in October 2017.</p><p>An independent evaluation and evidence review was carried out in 2020/2021 by the School of Public Health, UCC, covering the period 2016 to 2021. A review of the OPAP is currently underway which examines key actions as set out in the Ten Steps in the OPAP, considers the results of the independent Evaluation and Evidence Review conducted by the School of Public Health, UCC (2022) and reviews further implementation of OPAP since the period covered by the UCC work. This Review is nearing completion and is expected to be finalised and published in the coming weeks. The evaluation and evidence review carried out by UCC will be published alongside the OPAP Review.</p></reply>

The published Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. International surrogacy raises complex ethical questions concerning areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination.</p><p>Following the publication of the Final Report of the Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, an Inter-Departmental Group was established to review the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, along with other relevant matters, with the aim of determining an agreed policy position and suitable next steps, in the form of a unified Policy Paper and appropriate legislative proposals. I await the completion of this Group&rsquo;s work within the coming weeks. </p><p>Any policy and legislative proposals that may arise following the completion of the Departments&rsquo; examination of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations will require consideration and approval by Government. However, the clear intention of the Group, and Minister McEntee, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, is that the appropriate vehicle for accommodating legislative proposals in respect of international surrogacy &ndash; which will need to be formally drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel &ndash; will be through the insertion of relevant provisions into the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 at Committee Stage.</p><p>At this juncture, I cannot provide a definitive timeline as to when Committee Stage will be scheduled. Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that I wish to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible to ensure that a robust regulatory framework for AHR is in place.</p></reply>

Any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  The EMA&rsquo;s human medicines committee (CHMP) has thoroughly assessed the data on the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and recommended by consensus a formal Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) be granted by the European Commission. The awarding of a CMA provides a high level of assurance that a vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has met the requirements of the independent regulatory process as regards demonstrating its safety and efficacy.</p>  <p>  Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that evidence on transmission of COVID-19 following vaccination is limited.

The NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Department of Health based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.</p><p>Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland.You can view the updated guidelines here:  www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf.</p><p>The NIAC has recommended a first mRNA booster vaccine for those aged 5-11 years;  a second mRNA booster dose for those aged 50-64 years, persons aged 12-49 years with an underlying medical condition or are residents of long-term care facilities. </p><p>The NIAC has also made a number of recommendations regarding the Autumn/Winter period. It has advised that healthcare workers are offered a second mRNA booster and a third mRNA booster is recommended for persons aged 65 years and older, and those aged 12-64 years who are immunocompromised. The Chief Medical Officer has endorsed these recommendations and the rollout is now underway. </p><p>The NIAC will continue to examine emerging evidence regarding booster vaccines for others in the population where there is evidence of waning immunity and reduced effectiveness and will make further recommendations if required.</p><p>Further information on the booster vaccine rollout can be viewed here: www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine-booster-dose/.  </p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for medical services provided under the contract.</p>  <p>  GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for medical services provided to medical card or GP visit card holders, while patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis. I have no role in relation to the fees charged by individual GPs for services to private patients as they are a matter of private contract between the clinician and their patient.</p>  <p>  Currently, the HSE operate two schemes which offer financial assistance to people in receipt of prescribed HRT medication on the reimbursement list. HRT medications on the reimbursement list are available without cost to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card under the GMS scheme is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. Furthermore, under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines, which includes certain HRT medications.</p>  <p>  Progressing women&rsquo;s health is a priority for this government. Among the initiatives undertaken for the improvement of women&rsquo;s health services is the development of six specialist menopause clinics. While the majority of women who seek support for their menopause can be effectively supported by their GP, a proportion of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in menopause; it is intended these more complex cases can be dealt with, upon referral by their GP, in a specialist menopause clinic. </p>  <p>  Two specialist clinics have been opened with a third opening this week. It is anticipated that the last three clinics in Cork, Dublin and Galway will open before the end of this year, which will result in a total of six such clinics nationwide, one in each maternity network, for women who require complex, specialist care. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme are in the process of establishing a Professional Menopause Network which will comprise the clinical leads in this area from across the region and will include representation from the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP). The purpose of this network is to promote standardised care for women accessing the specialist clinics, but also to allow health professionals to learn from one another particularly in the implementation phase.  It is also intended that clinical teams within the specialist menopause clinic setting will provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.</p></reply>

International evidence shows that due to incidence and mortality from breast cancer in this age group, it is effective to screen women in this age range. The evidence also shows that the benefits of screening that can be gained by women in this age group outweigh the harms.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that any future decisions about changes to population-based screening programmes, including BreastCheck, will be made on the advice of the National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This is an independent expert group which considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria and makes recommendations to the Minister for Health. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards.</p>  <p>  The Committee's first Annual Call in 2021 for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received. Submissions were received from various sources, and have been undergoing consideration by the committee at its scheduled meetings during 2022. I am pleased to note, however, that the Committee has already made a decision in relation to breast cancer screening. Following submissions from several sources, including from BreastCheck, the Committee has asked HIQA to begin looking at the evidence for extending the age range from 45 to 49 and 70 to 74 years for breast screening.</p>  <p>  Updated EU Council recommendations on cancer screening were recently adopted by the European Commission, and the final recommendations are expected to be formally approved and published by the EU Council in December 2022.  The NSAC will consider the final updated Council recommendation and advise the Minister and Department of Health on the evidence as it applies to the population in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use and the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education will directly follow these two assemblies, if learnings from the concurrent running of assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.</p>  <p>  In line with this decision, the Department of Health has commenced preparations for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use, and, to this end, detailed discussions regarding the assembly took place at recent meetings of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy. </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Health have engaged with counterparts in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to examine how the voices and perspectives of young people on issues regarding drug policy may be collated and presented to the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use. Topics under consideration include an examination of how drug use impacts young people&rsquo;s lives, and that of their families, friends and communities, as well as their own views on the use of drugs and how young people could be better informed regarding drug use. </p>  <p>  These preparations are being undertaken to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use when the two existing assemblies complete their work.</p>  <p>  It is a strategic priority for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. The Government is implementing the health diversion programme, which offers compassion, not punishment to people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. This programme aligns with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, 2021 &ndash; 2025, which actively encourages Member States to scale up alternatives to coercive sanctions and to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use.</p>  <p>  I welcome the contribution of the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use to the government's health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. I believe that involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is relevant and informative.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted in July 2021 to cap contributions on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the NHSS to protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p><p>  In order to qualify for the relief offered under the legislation, a member of the family would have to be actively working the farm and also commit to working the productive asset for a substantial part of their working time for a period of six years. The reliefs offered are also subject to certain other conditions being met.</p><p>  Regarding a long-term lease arrangement, whether a farm partnership arrangement is eligible to receive the reliefs offered is conditional upon the criteria outlined in the legislation being met. Further advice in respect of this can be obtained from a local Nursing Homes Support Scheme Office.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p><p>Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e., mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card. Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. </p><p>However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds, under review and any proposed changes are considered in the context of Government policy and other issues which may be relevant.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that, since 1<sup>st</sup>December 2018, the medical card earnings disregard for persons in receipt of a Disability Allowance was increased from &euro;120 to &euro;427 per week and applies to the assessment process for both single persons and to family assessments. This measure gave effect to one of the key recommendations of the Make Work Pay for Persons with Disabilities Report and enables persons in receipt of the disability allowance to have a higher level of earnings and still retain their medical card. </p></reply>

This significant investment will enable implementation of many of the short and medium-term measures in our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision. It will enhance the provision of mental health supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention, to acute and specialist mental health service delivery. The funding will enable us to continue to deliver our vital services to as many people as possible, as we move into 2023.</p>  <p>   In relation to the HSE Mental Health care programme, &euro;750,000 has been provided in Budget 2023 to support counselling psychology training places. This funding demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthen access to psychology training. Further detailed discussions will now take place between the Department and HSE to progress both this and wider commitments of the 2023 Budget in the context of preparing the HSE Service Plan 2023. In addition, the Department of Health has been advised by the Department of Education that the Minister for Education and her Department very much value the work of all educational psychologists across the education system. I understand they are working proactively and intensively to find a positive resolution for the issue of fees for trainee educational psychologists.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Education and other Government Departments as required on the issue of workforce planning for health and social care professionals, including on future planning in terms of psychology education, training, and placement. This approach will support the implementation of Sharing the Vision.</p></reply>

This will begin a 2-year transition period during which existing practitioners may apply to register with CORU. On 30 November 2025, the title 'Social Care Worker' will become a legally protected title in Ireland. This positive milestone will ensure all service users receive the highest standards of care and empower CORU to act when any deficiencies are identified.</p>  <p>  CORU has engaged extensively, since 2017, with education providers on the standards required by Social Care Worker education programmes including undertaking a stakeholder consultation on the required education standards, holding meetings and information days with all education providers, and conducting site visits.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Act currently provides that during the two-year transition period, an existing practitioner who has been practising the profession of social care work for a continuous two-year period out of the previous five years, and whose employer states that they meet the standards for that profession may be eligible for entry into the register. </p>  <p>  CORU remain available to support existing practitioners and provide guidance on the entry routes to the Social Care Workers Register.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank you for raising a matter of understandable concern.</p></reply>

It was chaired by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases.</p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established.</p>  <p>  On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board, HRB, carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation.</p>  <p>  While some preliminary scoping work has been undertaken by the Department, during the pandemic all available Department of Health resources were devoted to the Public Health response. This has meant that progress on the development of policy in this area could not be progressed as intended.</p>  <p>  There is still significant work required to develop proposals for consideration by Government regarding vaccine damage compensation. As part of that work, it is anticipated that consideration will also be given to the inclusion of claims relating to alleged adverse reactions from COVID Vaccines.</p></reply>

As GPs are self-employed they may establish practices at a place of their own choosing.</p>  <p>  Medical card and GP visit card holders that experience difficulty in finding a GP to accept them as a patient, having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area), can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. It is expected that clinicians consider the importance of patients having access to a GP service close to home when deciding whether or not to accept private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas. It has implemented a number of measures and increased investment in general practice significantly to improve recruitment and retention. The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022, and following the transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of HSE contracted GPs in counties Cavan and Monaghan, as this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration at this time as these are our immediate priorities.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as wide a catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p>  <p>  The locations were also chosen in line with good practice which suggests that, in order to maximise economies of scale, dedicated, standalone elective centres should be &ldquo;as big as is reasonably possible&rdquo; to meet identified demand while providing appropriate population coverage. Locating the new facilities in Cork, Dublin and Galway will enable the provision of a national service while aiming to maximise the coverage of the ECCs as far as is reasonably possible. A central point of introducing these new facilities is not that they will only benefit the subset of the population that sit within their direct catchment but rather that the introduction of this new delivery capability into the Public Healthcare System will benefit the whole population, including those who do not fall within the immediate geographical catchment. It is envisaged that the Cork and Galway facilities combined will cater for up to 350,000 patients/procedures annually.</p>  <p>  Limerick City Council and members of the Limerick 2030 plan have engaged with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre (UPMC) on developing lands in a Limerick regeneration area. This includes plans for Limerick social housing. Limerick City Council sought UL Hospitals to meet with UPMC to outline the specific health needs of the Mid-Western region which informed UPMC&rsquo;s plans to build a 150-bed hospital, providing capital funding. They proposed the model of a Section 38 Hospital jointly run by UPMC and UL Hospitals Group. Such decisions are beyond the scope of UL Hospitals, they require government approval and thereafter sanction from the HSE. We understand that UPMC have engaged local and national political representatives on this proposal, as well as St. John&rsquo;s Hospital and UL Hospitals Group.</p></reply>

The Scheme will run for five years and has two approaches:</p>  <p>  -  ACRES Co-operation Project (CP), which applies in eight mapped zones that are areas of high nature value, hold significant carbon stores and are home to some of the most pristine waters in the country. </p>  <p>  -  ACRES General, for all other farmers not falling within CP Zones.</p>  <p>  The Scheme will support farmers in their efforts to tackle the challenges in climate, biodiversity, and water quality.  </p>  <p>  Using a habitats-based approach, delivered through both prescription and results-based actions, ACRES will contribute to improving biodiversity, climate, air, and water quality outcomes.  This Scheme builds on the success and learnings of recent agri-environmental schemes such as GLAS and REAP and European Innovation Partnership projects (EIPs).</p>  <p>  A maximum payment of &euro;10,500 annually is available to ACRES CP participants (&euro;7,311 for those in the General approach).  &euro;7,000 is ring-fenced for results-based payments, with the additional &euro;3,500 set aside for non-productive investments (NPI) and/or landscape actions (LA).  In addition to this, and mindful of the &euro;7,000 ceiling, farmers may choose to carry out three further actions on land within the CP Zone &ndash; traditional dry stone wall maintenance, conservation of rare breeds or low-emission slurry spreading.  For those with land outside the CP Zone, they may carry out general actions listed in the Terms and Conditions.</p>  <p>  The purpose of NPIs and LAs is to improve the habitats, and thereby the scores achieved in the results-based approach taken on holdings in CP Zones.  My Department has, with the assistance of the Co-operation Project Teams (CP Teams), compiled a list of approximately 50 NPIs which may be available to CP participant farmers depending on the location of their lands.  Participants in the CP Zones will have the assistance of CP Teams, who will discuss with farmers how best to improve the habitats and  maximise their scores and payments through the use of NPIs and Landscape actions.  </p>  <p>  To apply for ACRES, a farmer (holding a herd number, herd keeper is not sufficient), be over 18, have submitted an application for the Basic Payment Scheme in 2021, and must contact their approved ACRES advisor, who will prepare and submit the application on their behalf.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. </p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. </p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. </p>  <p>  I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. </p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. </p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and the Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors. Further submissions to the Court have been provided.</p>  <p>  As this matter continues to be sub judice, I am not in a position to comment further until the matter can be resolved before the Courts. </p></reply>

My Department works closely with the DHLGH regarding the development and implementation of the NAP as well as the protection and improvement of water quality.</p><p>The 5<sup>th</sup>NAP (implemented in Ireland through Statutory Instrument Number 113 of 2022 (as amended)) includes new and enhanced measures to help achieve water quality targets as well as providing for a significantly stronger focus on compliance and enforcement of the regulations. </p><p>At present Ireland is one of just four EU Members States that has been granted a Nitrates Derogation. </p><p>In granting Ireland an extension to its Nitrates Derogation covering the period 2022-2025, the European Commission included additional conditionality in its Implementing Decision.  This additional conditionality includes the requirement for Ireland to conduct a two-year water quality review in 2023 comparing water quality data from 2021 with data from 2022.  If this review results in a negative outcome for certain waters, the maximum stocking rate in the affected areas will drop from 250kg livestock manure nitrogen/hectare to a maximum of 220kg livestock manure nitrogen/hectare from 2024. In this scenario, impacted farmers will have a number of options at their disposal namely, one or a combination, of the following:</p><p>1. Acquire more land (owned, leased or rented) to allow them maintain livestock numbers</p><p>2. Export livestock manures to allow them maintain livestock numbers</p><p>3. Reduce livestock numbers </p><p>These are decisions that farmers will make and these decisions may have knock on impacts.</p><p>Teagasc conducted an initial assessment as part of the process of developing the 5<sup>th</sup>NAP. My Department has asked Teagasc to update this assessment and to also model the impact of reducing the maximum stocking rate on derogation farms to 220kg livestock manure nitrogen/hectare. This work is expected to conclude shortly.</p><p>My Department will continue to support our farm families to ensure there is a bright future for them and the sector.</p></reply>

Farmers may apply for one of the approaches available under ACRES, namely the ACRES General approach or the ACRES Co-operation approach depending on the location of their holding.  It is currently envisaged that the split will be 30,000 participants in ACRES General and 20,000 participants in ACRES Co-operation &ndash; this will, however, be ultimately subject to the level of interest in each approach. The intake into the scheme will be phased, with at least two tranches, to spread the workload on advisors and enable them to allocate sufficient time for the preparation of applications, and the completion of the Farm Sustainability Plan (FSP) and selection of appropriate actions.</p>  <p>  The contracts of those applicants who are approved into the Scheme in Tranche 1 will commence from 1 January 2023 with advance payments scheduled for Quarter 4 of 2023.  The current focus has been on opening the Scheme for applications.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. </p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. </p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. </p>  <p>  I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. </p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. </p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and the Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors. Further submissions to the Court have been provided.</p>  <p>  As this matter continues to be sub judice, I am not in a position to comment further until the matter can be resolved before the Courts. </p></reply>

This recognises the interconnectedness of human, animal, plant and environmental health. It requires a coordinated response across all sectors to effectively address the challenge </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s second One Health National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2021 &ndash; 2025, known as iNAP2 was jointly published by the Department of Health and my Department in November 2021.</p>  <p>  Promoting and supporting research into AMR related issues is one of the 5 key objectives in both the previous and current One Health national action plan.</p>  <p>  Under iNAP2, the Department of Health have commissioned research on the Economic Burden of AMR and the use of Point of Care Testing to guide antimicrobial prescribing. In addition, the Students and Graduates of the Last Decade (GOLD) competition was launched this month for early career healthcare professions to showcase their research on AMR and infection prevention and control.</p>  <p>  The Health Research Board co-ordinate and administer the Joint Programming Initiative JPI AMR in Ireland. This is a global collaborative organisation and platform, engaging 28 nations to curb AMR with a One Health approach since 2011. The goal is to shape cohesive and coordinated AMR funding and actions that maximise on resources and reduce duplication of research. The HRB has been involved in this joint programming initiative since January 2017 and is represented on the Management Board and funds calls that align with the HRB strategy.</p>  <p>  JPI AMR coordinates national public investments and funds transnational research and activities within the six priority areas of the shared JPIAMR Strategic Research and Innovations Agenda (SRIA) &ndash; therapeutics, diagnostics, surveillance, transmission, environment, and interventions. JPIAMR is seeking and supporting solutions to decrease transmissions of resistant bacteria, and to lessen the burden of AMR on a global scale.</p>  <p>  Since joining JPI AMR in 2017, Irish researchers have been partners in four transnational projects and eight Networks funded via JPIAMR, in the areas of transmission, surveillance and the environment, across five separate funding calls. In addition to projects focussed on human health supported by HRB, projects in the areas of animal health and environment have been supported by my Department and the EPA. This has been possible as HRB, DAFM and EPA are partners in ERA NET Co-Funds committing funding for relevant joint calls, to enable Irish researchers to participate in the competitive process.</p>  <p>  HRB funding support to Irish JPIAMR participants exceeds &euro;750,000.</p>  <p>  Ireland has recently confirmed its commitment to the European Commission for the One Health AMR Partnership and will work with the relevant co-ordinators to contribute to the development of the partnership application.</p>  <p>  In the agricultural sector, my Department has provided funding and support for research to investigate the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance in the animal health sector. Research projects funded and completed during the lifetime of Ireland&rsquo;s first national action plan, iNAP1 include investigations of respiratory disease on Irish pig farms, associated risk factors and the relationship between performance, welfare and antimicrobial use, research on antimicrobial use and resistance in the pig and poultry industry,  research to improve biosecurity on pig farms through utilisation of specific biosecurity tools and use of antimicrobials in animal health on the island of Ireland: knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Under iNAP2, research continues to be funded on several projects such as investigation of dietary manipulation to reduce the need for antimicrobials in the pig sector, quantifying antimicrobial use on Irish dairy farms, development of salivary and environmental biomarkers to manage antimicrobial use and resistance in pigs and implementation of behavioural interventions in dairy and pig farms.  </p>  <p>  Recognising the One Health aspect of AMR, research in relation to the role of the environment in the dissemination and spread of AMR has been also included in both action plans, with the majority of funding being from the Environmental Protection Agency, however my Department is funding one specific project carrying out AMR surveillance on soil.  AMR continues to be included in my Department's annual research call. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that very significant work, including promoting and supporting research, is being carried out in Ireland in response to this very One Health challenge, however this work will need to continue and adapt into the future.</p></reply>

ACRES is the third &lsquo;layer' in the Green Architecture model under the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and is a voluntary scheme whereby farmers, when approved into the Scheme, undertake certain actions on their land for at least 5 years &ndash; with those actions going beyond conditionality and the voluntary eco-scheme. Farmers may apply for one of the approaches available under ACRES, namely the ACRES General approach or the ACRES Co-operation approach depending on the location of their holding.  Using a habitats-based approach, delivered through both prescription and results-based actions, ACRES will contribute to improving biodiversity, climate, air, and water quality outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The Government has committed &euro;1.5 billion to the Scheme over its duration, which is the largest amount ever committed to an agri-environment scheme.  I consider that the rates of payments available to farmers under each of the approaches to be attractive, with a maximum annual payment of up to &euro;7,311 to a participant in ACRES General while a participant in the ACRES Co-operation approach could receive up to &euro;10,500 in a given year.   Payments offered under the Scheme were costed in accordance with the governing EU Regulation - that is, on the basis of additional costs incurred and income foregone resulting from the commitments made and transaction costs.  The payments were calculated using the most up to date information available at time of preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s draft CAP Strategic Plan, with all costings subsequently independently verified. </p>  <p>  One of the requirements of the Scheme is that applications, and the accompanying Farm Sustainability Plan, must be prepared and submitted by an approved ACRES advisor.  The rates such advisors charge their clients for this work is a matter for the farmer and his/her advisor.  My Department, in advance of the formal opening of the Scheme, provided training, by way of in-person events and an update webinar, to agricultural advisors on the proposed Scheme, with a significant volume of reference material make available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  In addition, there was an online farmer information meeting. There are also webinars and tutorials available on my Department's social media platform for advisors to access and view as and when required.</p>  <p>  Each approved ACRES advisor will work with their clients to choose the most appropriate actions for their holding with a view to maximising payments and to ensure these actions are in the most appropriate locations. Participation in the scheme is voluntary and participants may be subject to inspection as required by EU regulations. </p></reply>

The OGCIO builds resilience into its ICT solutions as a matter of course, and has disaster recovery plans and sites in a Government Data Centre.  Disaster recovery forms part of the overarching Business Continuity framework for their clients including my Department.</p>  <p>  For operational and security reasons no details can be disclosed in relation to cyber security tools and services or the costs associated with same.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in terms of cyber security strategies, the OGCIO also works closely with the National Cyber Security Centre which is a division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and encompasses the State's national/governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team.</p>  <p>  As regards cloud based services, my Department is currently working towards a transformation of the processes that support the delivery of its services using digitalisation and data to provide an integrated experience for our customers and policy makers, and this is outlined in my Department's ICT strategy. In line with Connecting Government 2030: A Digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland's Public Service, this will include the full consideration of the role of cloud based services for both current and any future systems. </p>  <p>  Currently my Department uses Cloud-based Internal Audit Management Software. In addition, the TidyTowns competition uses File Cloud as a vehicle for sharing data with external entities involved in delivering the competition. Once the competition cycle passes each year, this material is deleted.</p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund also uses Filecloud to receive applications. This has led to a more efficient application process. It is not used to save material, merely as a vehicle to receive and forward information. The information is ultimately stored on the Department's own internal Edocs system.</p>  <p>  The Department has also used the SharePoint platform for the purposes of delivering the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and to facilitate work on the National Outdoor Recreation Strategy.</p>  <p>  There are 4 agencies under the aegis of my Department: Pobal, The Charities Regulatory Authority, Water Safety Ireland, and the Western Development Commission. They are all independent agencies who manage their own IT and corporate matters, corporate compliance/policies, and staffing issues.</p></reply>

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025. A hub identification and mapping exercise began in late 2020 and is ongoing. </p><p>In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing the Connected Hubs ecosystem, the Network's shared online booking platform connectedhubs.ie, adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure, and supporting the establishment of new hubs.</p><p>There are currently 293 remote and co-working facilities across the country on-boarded to the connectedhubs.ie platform. This number is growing all the time, meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. The attached table provides a breakdown of the 293 hubs by county. </p><p>An interactive map is available on connectedhubs.ie that shows all the hubs that have been identified and mapped, and also provides useful information, such as addresses and the services that are available at each site, in relation to each of the hubs. This map can be found at the following :  <i>www.connectedhubs.ie/nationalhubsmap.html</i>. </p><p>Over &euro;100m has been invested by my department towards the establishment and development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities, with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs. Approximately &euro;14 million in funding has also been allocated to almost 200 projects via the Connected Hubs fund, enabling successful applicants to add additional capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and Broadband Connection Points) throughout the country. </p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the Connected Hub Network and on achieving this initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, with local authorities and communities, and with other stakeholders, including colleagues from the Department of Enterprise Trade &amp;amp; Employment, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network and the connectedhubs.ie platform.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in Our Rural Future.</p></reply>
