Each of these 10 LAGs was allocated &euro;500,000. </p><p>The increased allocations were based on an analysis of the level of funding the LAGs had committed to projects, and the amount drawn down by these projects, as of 20 September 2019.  </p><p>The LAGs were advised of the selection criteria in early July, when the proposed reallocation was announced. </p><p>As I have previously stated, I routinely keep the performance of all LAGs under review and, in particular, the progress they are making in allocating their project funding.  Based on the current indications, I am confident that all LEADER funds will be allocated by the LAGs in their respective areas by the end of the programming period.</p><p>However, if any additional funding becomes available, I will reallocate it to LAGs who have the capacity to manage the additional funding and who can demonstrate that there is a need for such funding in their areas.</p></reply>

It is funded by my Department and administered through the Local Authorities.</p><p>Since I reintroduced the LIS in 2017, I have granted over &euro;48 million to the Local Authorities to deliver the scheme.  This has resulted in over 2,000 road projects being approved for works.  </p><p>Meath County Council has been allocated over &euro;1.5 million of the funding since 2017, which I understand has supported the completion of works on 55 roads in the county.  This year alone, my Department awarded &euro;326,000 to County Meath under the LIS.</p><p>I plan to support the LIS scheme again in 2020, and a budget of &euro;10 million has been secured for this purpose.  This matches the level of funding announced for 2019 and demonstrates my commitment to the scheme.  </p><p>The exact level of funding to be provided to each Council in 2020, including Meath County Council, will be confirmed when the scheme is announced next year.</p><p>It is too early to give any indication of the level of funding which might be provided for the LIS in 2021. That will be decided as part of the annual Estimates process next year.</p></reply>

This is generally where a  project is not eligible under the terms of the scheme, or where the project does not score high enough compared to other applications.  </p><p>There is no formal appeals system in place for the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. However, my officials are available to provide feedback to the Local Authorities in respect of any unsuccessful applications. </p><p>While I understand that the unsuccessful projects will be disappointed by the outcome, the assessment process ensures that the Department is funding projects that deliver the best return for the public monies available.  Local Authorities will also have the opportunity to submit revised applications in respect of the unsuccessful towns or village projects to the 2020 scheme.</p></reply>

In August I approved a comprehensive review of the LCDCs which was underpinned by extensive consultation and highlighted the significant progress made since LCDCs were established.  The review also recognised a number of challenges that need to be addressed to secure the longer-term effectiveness of the structures. It makes a series of recommendations including securing greater cross-government buy-in; improved development and support programmes for LCDCs and their members; and strengthening and streamlining administrative supports.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the LCDC review recommendations is included as an action in the recently published Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities; A five year strategy for the community and voluntary sector in Ireland 20179-2024.  My Department is identified as the body with lead responsibility for its implementation, with Local Government, other Government Departments and the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary sector all having a part to play.</p>  <p>My Department has begun the implementation of the review recommendations, recently initiating a process of engagement with other Government Departments to promote more cross government commitment to the LCDCs. In addition, a successful networking event for LCDCs took place on the 9th   November looking at leadership and climate change. Work has begun on the other six actions that were scheduled to begin on Q4 2019 and this work will continue into the early part of 2020.  </p>  <p>  Additional funding will be provided in 2020 to support LCDC's in line with the recommendations of the review.</p></reply>

This funding will be re-allocated from the savings to be realised under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund sub-head this year. </p>  <p>  My Department is closely monitoring the ongoing drawdowns from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and is working closely with the lead parties for the projects to ensure that funding is released without delay.  In tandem with this process, my Department is also actively managing end-of-year expenditure under its other rural and community capital programmes.  Any savings emerging within our overall budget will be used to benefit other demands, as appropriate.</p>  <p>Finally, it should also be noted that the second call for Category 1 applications for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed on 6th August 2019.  There was an excellent response from across the country and my Department received 69 applications for funding.

The strategy was co-produced by Government and the Community and Voluntary Sector through a Cross Sectoral Group (CSG) established for that purpose. </p>  <p>  The sector participated in comprehensive consultation with my Department to support the strategy development process and many, if not all, of the issues detailed in the report mentioned by the Deputy arose as part of those consultations. The strategy recognises the impact of previous policy and resource decisions on the sector and seeks to address these through its 11 high-level objectives and associated actions. The strategy aims to empower communities, their representative organisations, and the community and voluntary sector, to inform and shape responses to their needs into the future. </p>  <p>  This is an ambitious strategy and will take time to implement. While implementation of all of the actions will begin during the strategy period, there are some that will continue to be progressed and built upon beyond the life of the current strategy, particularly those that address the development of a sustainable funding model. These actions are no less a priority because they will take longer to implement fully. On the contrary, I recognise that these actions are crucial to a sustainable community and voluntary sector and will underpin support for the sector for many years to come. My Department is committed to the full implementation of the Strategy and I look forward to working closely with the sector to support its implementation.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence provides that Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of peacekeeping and crisis management missions is a key policy requirement. While each mission has elements of danger, it is the Government's position that all actions should be taken to minimise threats to the safety of personnel. Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p><p>The White Paper identified the procurement of a small number of armoured logistics vehicles for overseas missions as a force protection requirement. A contract valued at &euro;7.5m (incl. VAT) was awarded to an Irish company, Westward Scania, in 2017 for the provision of 10 new armoured logistic vehicles for the Defence Forces, in order to provide combat service support personnel with the requisite force protection to operate in a supporting role in high threat environments. The vehicles were delivered in 2018 and are in operational service. The procurement of these vehicles also enhances Ireland's ability to participate in integrated multinational deployments. There are currently no plans to procure additional armoured logistics vehicles. The number of vehicles purchased in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019 is set out in the following table. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of Armoured Logistics Vehicles Purchased</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 (to date)</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

International law is clear that Israeli settlements in occupied territory are illegal, and Ireland and the EU have made their views on settlements known on multiple occasions. Most relevantly to this case, under international law they are not part of the State of Israel. </p>  <p>  Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. In the specific case of the occupied Palestinian territory, an Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin was published by the European Commission on 12 November 2015. This provides guidance to importers and retailers on how EU rules on place of origin labelling should be applied in this case. </p>  <p>  In relation to the case referred to the Court of Justice in June 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, found that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. </p>  <p>  The Court of Justice&rsquo;s ruling is an interpretation of France&rsquo;s implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s Notice and associated EU Regulations. It essentially does not change the situation. However, my Department is currently examining the judgment and reflecting on whether there are implications for Ireland. We will consult, if required, with other Departments in the coming period. </p>  <p>  The Commission Interpretative Notice on Indications of Origin of 12 November 2015 is already on my Department&rsquo;s website. It was circulated to other Departments at the time of publication to bring the guidelines to the attention of relevant bodies dealing with labelling or consumer protection. Accuracy of product labelling will continue to be a consumer protection issue, monitored and enforced as heretofore.</p></reply>

We, along with our EU partners, take these reports very seriously and have raised our concerns at official and political level with our Chinese counterparts on a consistent basis. </p>  <p>  On 29 October this year, Ireland was one of 23 States to sign up to a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in New York on this issue. This statement called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, including by refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities.</p>  <p>  In July this year, Ireland was also one of 22 States to sign up to a Joint Letter at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. This letter expressed concerns about credible reports of arbitrary detention in large-scale places of detention, as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. It called on China to uphold its national laws and international obligations, and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  This issue has been raised on multiple occasions at EU level. In April 2019, it was raised at both the EU-China Summit and EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. During the dialogue the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, these actions must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms, and international laws. The EU has also raised this issue at multilateral level, calling on China to allow meaningful, unrestricted, and unsupervised access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to raise our concerns during contacts with Chinese authorities in bilateral and multilateral contexts, at both official and political level.</p></reply>

They also possess skillsets which are essential to the smooth running of Missions abroad such as administrative and technical skills, a deep knowledge of the local environment and culture, and a fluency in local languages.</p>  <p>  Employment agency staff are employed in a small number of missions where the necessity arises. Such missions include new Missions, those with particular complexities in the local labour market or those where changes in the workload necessitate an assessment of the number and type of roles or skills needed to be undertaken.

While I have not yet had the opportunity to speak with Minister Champagne, who took up office on 20 November last, I am looking forward to engaging with him in the near future. </p>  <p>  In particular, I look forward to briefing the Minister on our new Canada Strategy with its enhanced political and diplomatic focus on Canada within the overall context of Global Ireland and our expanded global footprint. I will highlight the impressive increase in bilateral trade, tourism and investment flows in recent years.  I will also recall Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and thank Minister Champagne for Canada&rsquo;s continued support for the Good Friday Agreement and the Peace Process.     </p>  <p>  In line with the Strategy, we are devoting considerable new resources to the bilateral relationship with Canada, with a new Consulate General opening in Vancouver in October 2018 and another Consulate General planned for Toronto in the coming years.  In parallel, we are expanding the presence and reach of our Agency network across Canada, with Enterprise Ireland having recently announced its intention to open an office in Montreal. We are also establishing a dedicated US and Canada Directorate at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland to support and oversee delivery of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  With our shared attachment to the multilateral rules-based order and values as well as our shared commitment to free trade, I am confident that Ireland and Canada will continue to cooperate closely on emerging global challenges. I look forward to discussing these issues with Minister Champagne in due course.</p></reply>

The latest publicly available set of accounts are for 2018 and show that as at 31 December 2018, the financial assets held in the Escrow fund amounted to &euro;14.271 billion. The decrease in the value of the Fund was the result of changes in the value of financial assets, combined with interest expenses, resulting in an overall decrease of &euro;14 million in the value of the Fund. A further &euro;2 million operating expenses has been accrued at the year end. </p><p>The full report is available in the following link:  </p><p>The arrangements in the Escrow Framework Deed include the agreement that all claims of ownership and access to this money is suspended until the European Courts have concluded proceedings that the Government and Apple have brought. In general terms, all income and expenses, including any gains or losses, will accrue to the Escrow Fund. Depending on the final outcome of the European Court proceedings it is likely that the balance of the Fund at that time will be made available to the successful party i.e. if Ireland and Apple are unsuccessful in their case to Ireland, and if Ireland and Apple are successful in their case to Apple.  </p><p>It is not possible at this stage to determine any potential losses or gains that may accrue to the Escrow Fund when the European Courts have made a final determination over the validity of the Commission's decision. The performance of the escrow fund is determined by the prevailing interest rate environment and the asset credit quality over the duration of the escrow fund. For illustrative purposes, the NTMA estimates that in the current negative interest rate environment, the escrow fund could decline by 0.5% per annum. On a &euro;14 billion fund, this would amount to a loss of c. &euro;70 million per annum. </p><p>Over the past seven years approximately &euro;7.5 million (including VAT) has been paid for external services relating to the case, of which approximately &euro;3.9 million relates to the recovery process. This includes all legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs. These fees have been paid by the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the NTMA; the Central Bank of Ireland; the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office; and, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. </p><p>The accounts of the Fund will be produced on an annual basis and information on the value of the Fund will not be provided outside this process.</p></reply>

This process identifies on a case by case basis, both current and upcoming resource requirements in the Department and the best method to fill each vacancy. The timescale for filling vacancies from open or interdepartmental competitions varies and is dependent on the availability of panels from the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The absence of a PAS panel will generally delay the filling of a vacancy. Internally run competitions in the Department generally have a quicker turnaround time. To date in 2019 52 new staff have joined the Department and we currently have 9 vacancies as follows: 1 Principal Officer, 2 Administrative/Higher Executive Officer, 4 IGEES Administrative Officers and 2 Executive Officers.

Following the Government decision in December 2018 to give greater priority to preparations for a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment plans. Revenue continuously adjusts its recruitment, training and deployment of staff in response to business needs including Brexit -related developments.  Revenue&rsquo;s current serving permanent staff number (as at 30 November 2019), is 6,638 (WTE).  Therefore, there are no vacancies at this time. To date in 2019, the average weekly serving permanent staff number is 6,443 (WTE). </p><p>To date in 2019, Revenue has appointed over 1,040 staff from open and interdepartmental competitions, at all levels and across a range of functions and specialist areas including tax; information technology; accounting and legal professionals; data analysts; economists; and for Brexit-related roles including Trade Facilitation. Revenue recruitment is an iterative process, critical posts are filled to meet business requirements and recruitment is undertaken to maintain and enhance capability. Revenue is currently recruiting or has recruitment plans in place to fill all critical posts in the context of projected retirements and business needs in 2020.  </p><p>Revenue have also advised me that its Vote for each of the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 provided for a staff complement of 5,924, 6014 and 6,114 WTE respectively and the average weekly serving WTE in each of those years was 5,911, 6,008 and 6,085 WTE respectively. Revenue&rsquo;s structure has evolved over time with a focus on ensuring that appropriate resources are applied in response to tax and duty risk. In particular, during 2018, Revenue changed its structure to align resources with risk in five new national Divisions. These changes are reflected in the tables in the following link, which set out the WTE staff complement by functional area, by month, from 2016 to date.  </p><p>  ">Payments</p></reply>

The Workforce Plan aims to address the large existing caseload which the Office inherited on 01 January 2018, along with the sustained pattern of increased demand which the office continues to experience. </p><p>Following a review of this work force plan, on the 26th March 2019, I approved a substantial increase in staff for the recruitment of an additional 35 staff members as per the following details:</p><p><b>Additional Posts Sanctioned(2019)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Assistant Principal</th>       <th>Higher Executive Officer</th>       <th>Executive Officer</th>       <th>Clerical Officer</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The sanction to recruit an additional 35 posts brings the overall approved sanction for the FSPO to 90.2. Where possible, existing panels have been used to fill vacancies as they have arisen.  In addition, recruitment campaigns were undertaken in May 2019, for the grades of Executive Officer and Higher Executive Officer, and in September 2019 for the grades of Executive Officer and Clerical Officer. </p><p>Priority is being given to the filling of vacancies within the following functional areas: </p><p>- Dispute Resolution / Mediation</p><p>- Investigation / Adjudication / Legal Services</p><p>The FSPO recently filled the position of Principal Officer for the Corporate and Communications Service.

This figure was reaffirmed in the Section 53 Annual Statement 2020 which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 2019. The realisation of the surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and the completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s &euro;4 billion surplus represents a projected entity return on investment (EROI) of 37%. The EROI is based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the participating institutions as part of the loan acquisition price. NAMA&rsquo;s EROI target benchmark, as approved by its Board in 2014, is 20%. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the surplus has yet to fully crystallise and that the transfer of surplus funds to the Central Fund can only begin after NAMA's remaining subordinated debt and equity obligations have been repaid in full, which is expected to be in mid-2020. It is envisaged that &euro;2 billion will be transferred to the Exchequer in 2020 with a further &euro;2 billion being transferred in 2021. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged and prevailing market conditions that may determine the timing and disposal proceeds of residual assets.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

For example, a stay may have been placed on the progression of the appeals by the TAC by Order of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court.

This is achieved by providing simplified procedures to the greatest extent possible, user friendly on-line solutions that are available on a 24/7 basis and high levels of customer support when required.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s risk identification systems and procedures constantly monitor tax returns to ensure compliance and where anomalies are identified interventions are carried out to confirm the accuracy of the data provided. The intervention type is dependent on the level of risk involved and the level of engagement displayed by the taxpayer. The intervention types include assurance checks for the more straight-forward issues up to tax audit and investigation with a view to prosecution for the more serious risks. Any additional liability identified is subjected to additional penalty and interest charges.  </p><p>Revenue also has a clear preference to engage with taxpayers experiencing temporary tax payment difficulties to agree mutually acceptable solutions, which will include an interest element, rather than deploying debt collection/enforcement sanctions to secure outstanding liabilities. However, where there is no engagement or a lack of commitment to identifying and agreeing a solution then Revenue has no option other than to use its debt collection/enforcement powers up to and including insolvency proceedings in the most egregious cases.</p><p>The number and value of penalties charged/collected together with the amounts of interest charged/collected by Revenue for the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 by tax head are set out in tables 1-4 below. Table 5 sets the number of insolvency cases by category for the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 that are monitored by Revenue. The monitoring process includes engaging with insolvency practitioners to maximise payment of liabilities, ensuring Company Law is enforced and working constructively with Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) and Approved Intermediaries. The Liquidation and Bankruptcy proceedings initiated by Revenue are separately identified in Table 5.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="9"><div>Table 1 - Interest Charged and Collected by

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of another individual. Fees which are met from any other source, from a grant or scholarship fro example, are not allowable.  In addition, examination fees, administration fees and registration fees do not qualify for relief. </p>  <p>  The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course.  However, an amount must be disregarded from each claim, whether the claim is in respect of one or more students. &ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; for the purposes of the relief mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course, at an approved college, reduced by the amount of the "student contribution". The disregarded "student contribution" amount is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course and &euro;1,500 in the case of a part-time course, and it applies to all third level courses.  This means the first &euro;3,000 or &euro;1,500, as appropriate, of all fees claimed by an individual taxpayer does not attract tax relief. As a claim may relate to one or more students, generally claimants will get full tax relief on the tuition fees for each of the second and subsequent students in their claim. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the number of courses per claimant, or the breakdown between full and part time courses, from the available data in relation to the disregard for third-level tuition fees. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the tax cost associated with changes to the disregard amount, as outlined by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the estimated cost of increasing the maximum benefit from &euro;7,000 to &euro;10,000, &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000; it is not possible to estimate such costs as it would depend on variables such as the amounts claimed and the numbers in respect of which claims are made. </p>  <p>  Finally, regarding allowing the third-level tuition fees relief to be claimed at the higher rate of tax and on the assumption that the Deputy is referring to allowing the relief on third level tuition fees to be claimed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax; Revenue advise that this change has an estimated cost of &euro;8 million. This does not account for any changes in taxpayer behaviour associated with the increased rate of relief. It is also the case that equity issues would arise in the event of such a change taking place.</p></reply>

The Central Bank's approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place. </p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA) is a statutory Code that ensures that lenders have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  Within this process, due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. </p><p>The CCMA applies to a mortgage loan secured by a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence. A split mortgage, as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, is considered to be a type of alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) under the CCMA. A regulated entity must ensure that the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework, as set out in the CCMA, is applied not only to cases where a mortgage account first enters into arrears or pre-arrears, but also where an ARA put in place breaks down or where the term comes to an end. The MARP includes obligations to assess the borrower&rsquo;s case based on the full circumstances of the borrower, and to explore all of the options for ARAs offered by that regulated entity in order to determine which options for ARAs are viable for a particular case.  When the term of an ARA comes to an end, the regulated entity must re-assess the borrower&rsquo;s case in accordance with the MARP.</p><p>The MARP also requires that a regulated entity must review an ARA at intervals that are appropriate, including at least 30 calendar days in advance of the ARA coming to an end, or at any time if requested by the borrower. Where there has been a change in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, the regulated entity must request an updated standard financial statement from the borrower and must consider the appropriateness of the ARA for the borrower. Where an ARA is offered to the borrower, the regulated entity must provide the borrower with a clear explanation of how the ARA works and the reasons why it is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The Central Bank has communicated its expectations that regulated entities must also provide the borrower with information on how the borrower&rsquo;s case was assessed, and the reasons why ARAs considered, but not offered to the borrower, are not appropriate and not sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p><p>The regulated entity must have in place an appeals process which allows the borrower to appeal certain decisions, including where an ARA is offered but the borrower is not willing to accept, and where no ARA is offered.</p><p>The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. In early 2018, I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.This Report was published late last year and found that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  Amongst one of the findings in the Report was that when a loan is sold by a bank, any existing ARAs in place with a borrower under the CCMA continues to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends. There was no evidence that borrowers, whose circumstances have not changed, were being moved off existing ARAs during the term of the ARA.</p><p>In August 2019, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales (the industry letter). The industry letter sets out clear expectations of firms, in particular where a cooperating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA and their loan is sold, that the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the ARA.  Additionally, the letter outlined that the new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA until review, expiry or by agreement, as appropriate, including honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA. In cases where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, any change to the ARA must comply with the CCMA and be appropriate, sustainable and proportionate to any change(s) in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.</p><p>The industry letter is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s </p><p>Finally, as at end-June 2019, 21,291 PDH mortgage accounts were in a split mortgage restructure. 85.4 per cent were deemed to be meeting the terms of this restructure type  - </p><p><i>of public statistical release </i></p><p><i>Source</i>: Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics and </p></reply>

My Department has to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p></reply>

Accordingly, my Department is not involved in the placement of individual children in school.</p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. </p><p>Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.</p><p>In Kildare alone, there are 75 special classes and 4 Special Schools providing specialist support to children with more complex special educational needs.</p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places in Kildare to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing. </p><p>The NCSE has informed the Department that, in general, they are satisfied that they have planned sufficient ASD post primary special class placements to meet identified need in Kildare for next year.</p><p>I understand that the local Special Education Needs Organiser is working with the family and will continue to be available until a suitable placement has been secured.</p></reply>

In order to tackle educational disadvantage, the DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS. Evidence from the evaluations of the DEIS programme to date demonstrate that it is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. This approach is supported by national and international research and will continue to be my Departments approach to addressing educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  In the 2019/20 school year there are 891 schools in the DEIS Programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. My Department will spend in the region of &euro;125 million in 2019 on the DEIS Programme. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the DEIS Plan acknowledges that the allocation of teaching resources to DEIS primary schools with the highest concentrations of children at risk of educational disadvantage has served to improve learning outcomes.  It also commits to the evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to be undertaken to inform future policy in this area.   </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this a Class Size Working Group was established comprising representatives from the Education Partners, the Educational Research Centre and the relevant Business Units in my Department. This group has met on a number of occasions to consider class size in the context of  improved learning outcomes of those most at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  A report on the work of this group is currently being finalised and will take into consideration the feedback and observations of the working group members.  It is intended that this will be finalised in the coming weeks and its findings will inform future policy direction in this area.</p></reply>

The recently enacted<i>Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act </i>2019 contains provisions that will enable the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM) alongside the establishment of a new national fund for the Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL). </p><p>The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark and to recruit international students.  Through the Code of Practice for the IEM, education providers will also be required to establish policies and procedures that address specific areas surrounding the employment of their education and teaching staff.  This will include key matters such as the recruitment, training and the cessation of employment of staff. </p><p>This new legislation will also empower QQI to establish a Learner Protection Fund. The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide it. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid.</p><p>In addition, this legislation also provides QQI with additional statutory powers to examine the bona fides and to perform corporate fitness checks of providers. This will allow QQI to assess the track record of providers in terms of their compliance with employment law, their financial robustness and the fit and proper person status of key personnel such as owners, directors and senior management.  </p><p>The employment terms and conditions of teachers in the English language education sector was an issue that was debated extensively as this legislation passed through the Oireachtas.  In addition to the measures outlined above, a mediator was appointed to engage with the English language education sector in January of this year. The mediator&rsquo;s remit was to work with employer and employee representative bodies to explore whether there was scope for a set of appropriate employment standards which could be agreed for the sector. The mediator&rsquo;s report, published in July 2019, recommended that an application be made to the Labour Court to establish a Joint Labour Committee (JLC), in accordance with industrial relations legislation, to address all aspects of the working conditions and pay of employees in English language schools with a view to the issuing of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) for the sector.</p><p>Based on this report, Mr Pat Breen T.D., Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, referred the matter to the Labour Court for its consideration.  Following the completion of its deliberations and in accordance with industrial relations legislation, the Labour Court provided its recommendation to Minister Breen in respect of the establishment of a JLC for this sector. Minister Breen has accepted this recommendation and has signed an establishment order for a JLC for this sector that came into effect on 2 December 2019.</p></reply>

Teachers are equipped to make such decisions as a result of their initial teacher education and the ongoing support provided by the Professional Developmeent Service for Teachers (PDST).  </p><p>  There are also protocols in place to ensure that strict criteria are observed by schools when inviting external agencies to address students about particular issues. </p><p>The issue of alcohol misuse is addressed in the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. As students progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues, including substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling. </p><p>SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in Junior Cycle. It also forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning for the new Junior Cycle which was introduced in September 2017. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p><p>Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is also developed.</p></reply>

My Department's inspectorate conducts robust quality assurance of provision in SPHE and RSE through its programme of inspection in schools. Inspectors check: that the school timetable includes time for SPHE and RSE; that the RSE policy has been developed; that broad and balanced coverage of the SPHE and RSE curriculum is evident in school planning; and, in focused evaluations of SPHE and RSE lessons, that students are achieving the intended outcomes of the curriculum. During all whole-school evaluations, school management is required to confirm that the full Stay Safe programme (at primary), SPHE and RSE curriculum are being provided. Where there is evidence that provision is unsatisfactory, recommendations for improvement are made. In those cases where there is no or inadequate implementation of the SPHE and RSE curriculum, the inspectorate conducts a range of follow-through actions until such time as the relevant school is regarded as being compliant with the requirements in this area. </p>  <p>  There is dedicated Continuing Professional Development (CPD) provision to teachers to assist them in delivering the SPHE programme. This is provided by way of training courses provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and by way of online resources, which can assist teachers, by providing methodologies for teaching SPHE.</p></reply>

Prospective applicants on higher incomes may not have applied for support as their income was above the relevant threshold. As such, it is not possible to accurately cost the number of additional students who may qualify for support, if the thresholds are increased. </p>  <p>  Allowing for the limitations regarding the accuracy of the costings, it is estimated that a 5% increase in the income thresholds would cost in the region of &euro;10m and a 10% increase would cost in the region of &euro;20m. The cost of increasing the threshold by 20% is more difficult to estimate given the potentially large number of students who may benefit but who have not previously applied to SUSI for support. It is therefore estimated that a 20% increase could cost in the region of &euro;50m.</p>  <p>  The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments nor do they include any changes to the post-graduate income thresholds.</p></reply>

The capital allocation for 2019 amounted to &euro;92 million, representing a 50% increase on capital investment in 2018. Capital investment will increase again to over &euro;116 million in 2020, which will provide for continued investment in Garda ICT of approximately &euro;75 million; a further &euro;9 million for the Garda Fleet and approximately &euro;32 million for the Garda estate.</p>  <p>  This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  We now have over 14,300 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff. It is important to note that the increased recruitment of Garda staff is facilitating the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative to mainstream policing duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in 2014, approximately 3,000 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream policing duties nationwide including 197 who attested last week on 29 November, the final attestation of this year. Taken together, the increase in Garda&iacute;, Garda staff and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative duties means a significant increase in operational policing hours around the country in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that funding has been allocated for 2020 which will allow for the recruitment of up to 700 new Garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff, the balance of which will be for the Commissioner to decide based on operational needs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Garda Commissioner is statutorily responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.  As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>I am informed by the Commissioner that a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, and welfare issues impact upon the allocation and transfer of Garda personnel amongst the Garda Divisions.  I am assured that comprehensive consultation occurs with local Garda management during which all the above-mentioned factors are considered.  I am further assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure optimum use of resources.</p></reply>

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p><p>Reflecting the Government's commitment to ensure that the Bureau is adequately resourced, the CAB&rsquo;s staffing and budgetary allocation has increased significantly in recent years.  The Bureau's budgetary allocation has gone up from &euro;7.042 million in 2016 to &euro;8.603m in 2019.  The Bureau's budget for 2020 has been increased to a total of &euro;9.1 million.</p><p>The Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 - 2016 provide the legal framework underpinning the Bureau's powers to take all necessary actions, including the making of applications to the High Court, in relation to the seizing and securing of assets with a view to their disposal in due course in accordance with the provisions of that legislation. </p><p>With regard to the specific information sought by the Deputy, I would point out that Section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 requires the Bureau, through the Garda Commissioner, to provide a report of its activities each year to the Minister for Justice and Equality who is then required to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  </p><p>The Annual Reports (including the most recent, the Annual Report 2018, which was published in June this year) are available in the Oireachtas library and on the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my own Department.  The published reports provide full details of all assets seized and disposed of by the Bureau. Further information can be found at the following address</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The final statistics for 2019 are not yet complete or ready for publication. I expect to receive the 2019 report by mid-2020.</p></reply>

For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.</p>  <p>  The 2017 Act also set out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.  </p>  <p>  In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.</p>  <p>  - Sexual intercourse must have taken place;</p>  <p>  - the person must not have consented; and</p>  <p>  - the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.</p>  <p>  During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused honestly believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented would not be found guilty of rape.   </p>  <p>  It was on foot of those debates that the Attorney General and my predecessor as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Commission's recently published Report recommends a change in the law to state that the belief of the accused person in consent must be reasonably held. It also touches on some of the surrounding matters which are being examined elsewhere, such as rape myths and stereotypes, obstacles to prosecution in rape cases, the treatment of victims in rape cases and other related matters.</p>  <p>  The timing of the Commission's report is particularly welcome, given that the review of protections for vulnerable witness in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, chaired by an expert barrister Tom O&rsquo;Malley, is due to be completed by the end of this year.  I intend to consider these two sets of recommendations in tandem, with a view to bringing forward proposals for legislation to implement the recommendations as appropriate, while of course maintaining the necessary fairness and balance inherent in our criminal justice process. </p>  <p>  I have no role in the prosecution of offences or convictions for offences, these are entirely matters for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts, who are independent in the exercise of their functions. The Deputy will also appreciate that the conduct of criminal investigations are for the Commissioner and his team, and I have no role as Minister in these matters.</p>  <p>  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuously improving its specialist services. Responding to the needs of victims and vulnerable persons has seen the rolling out by the Commissioner of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs).  These Units are staffed by specially trained personnel and will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime. </p>  <p>  DPSUs are tasked with improving services to victims of domestic and sexual violence, improving the investigation of domestic and sexual violence incidents and identifying and managing risk. I am informed that to date, DPSUs have been established in 13 locations nationwide, namely Carlow, Cork City, DMR South Central, DMR West, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth and Waterford Garda Divisions as well as the newly established units in DMR East, DMR South and Tipperary.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is expected that DPSUs should be rolled-out to all Divisions on a phased basis by the end Q1, 2020. Rollout of these units will meet a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p></reply>

The report and the submissions made to the public consultation are available on the LSRA&rsquo;s website at www.lsra.ie. </p>  <p>  Based on the evidence gathered, the expert report made a series of 14 proposals to reform legal education and training, including a move to a competency based framework and the establishment of a Legal Practitioner Education and Training (LPET) Committee which would be responsible for setting the statement of competence and defining standards which legal practitioners would achieve on qualification. The LPET Committee would require existing providers of legal education to demonstrate how they meet these standards and to enable new providers to explain how they would seek to meet them.  </p>  <p>  In its report to me, the Authority outlined that the implementation of these proposals would entail significant change and required careful consideration and informed debate and that legislative change would also be required.  In that regard, the LSRA has conducted further consultation with the professional bodies for legal practitioners, the Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns, the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar of Ireland and with the public and the legal services and education sectors.  Furthermore, on 19 September 2019, the Authority hosted a well-attended symposium on legal education and training in Croke Park, at which the views of key stakeholders were aired and the proposals for reform were discussed at length. </p>  <p>  The Authority has indicated that it will submit a further report under section 34 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 in early 2020 which will make such recommendations as it considers appropriate. In April next year, the LSRA will also submit the first annual report on the admission policies of the legal profession.  The report will consider if the number of persons admitted to practise as barristers and solicitors in that year is consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost.  In this regard the report will consider the demand for the services of practising barristers and solicitors and the need to ensure adequate standards of education and training for persons admitted to practise. </p></reply>

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The scheme, which was opened to applications from the 14th of October is aimed at enterprises with a turnover or balance sheet total of less than &euro;10M and a workforce of fewer than 50 people across a variety of sectors.  Small Irish businesses or enterprises can apply for one of the 200 productivity vouchers valued at &euro;2,500 each, to help them develop a more efficient and productive business operation.  To qualify, businesses should examine their current operations and identify opportunities for addressing productivity gaps or improving efficiency in their business. There is a finite quantity of vouchers, so it is a competition to find the most deserving applicants. The applicant must make a convincing case, demonstrating how their business could make the best use of this funding opportunity.  The productivity challenge aims to increase business productivity in any of the following ways:</p>  <p>  - Improve the quality of products</p>  <p>  - Reduce delivery times</p>  <p>  - Lower the cost of production</p>  <p>  - Reduce business waste </p>  <p>  - Increase the ability to generate more revenue</p>  <p>  The Productivity Voucher aims to improve the quality of what businesses make, reduce the costs of running the business and help deliver more, faster. It will help businesses find new ways to implement more efficient processes, innovative production techniques, improved delivery systems or find new ways to streamline the organisational methods within a business.</p>  <p>  The Productivity Voucher can be used in small businesses to engage and leverage experts who can consult with the businesses and help them assess their value chains and operations. This process can cover supply chain management, internal business and production operations, right through to logistics and distribution networks. Additionally, it can be used to Invest in training &amp;amp; capability development. It will support the development of a more effective, capable and efficient workforce through relevant training. </p>  <p>The closing date for applications for The Productivity Challenge Fund was on the 22nd November. An Evaluation Panel is currently reviewing applications against the stated criteria to form a? shortlist of 200 businesses who will be selected to receive a Productivity Voucher worth &euro;2,500.  Successful applicants will be informed prior to year-end 2019 ?by the Local Enterprise Office.</p></reply>

The proposal was on the Competitiveness Council Agenda on 28 November 2019 for general approach. In the absence of sufficient support for the presidency's proposal, the presidency announced that it would continue work on this file and that it would reflect on the best way for taking this forward. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports transparency. However, in relation to this proposal on public country by country reporting of income tax, Ireland supported a joint statement to the Competitiveness Council which agreed with the Council Legal Service that the legal base for this proposal should be a tax base (Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), and therefore, should be considered by Ecofin Council. Moreover, we consider that this measure should have the benefit of tax expertise to ensure that it is consistent with existing reporting requirements and, importantly, with the international cooperation and exchange of information arrangements, which are based on confidentiality. Tax experts are best placed to ensure that international efforts to collect income tax from multinational corporations will not be undermined by new measures.</p></reply>

I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth.</p>  <p>  Since Q1 2015, when the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJ) commenced there has been an increase of 312,500 people in employment across the State as at Q3 2019, with 195,600 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period. That is over 62% - or almost 3 out of every 5 jobs created. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to note the latest Labour Force Survey results for Q3 2019 which show continued good progress on regional employment in the past 12 months. In the year to Q3 2019, employment has increased in six of the eight regions. The West and Mid-East have experienced strong growth, with employment growing by 5.3% and 5% respectively. This exceeds employment growth in the State overall of 2.4%.  Moreover, the unemployment rate fell in five of the eight regions in the year to Q3 2019. The South-East with an unemployment rate of 7.3% is currently the only region with an unemployment rate in excess of the national average by one percentage point.</p>  <p>  To continue to build on the progress on employment growth throughout the country, and to ensure that the jobs created are sustainable and of high quality, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 earlier this year. The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, the Higher Education Institutes and others. </p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plans continue to deliver to the Government's RAPJ target to generate an uplift of 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 (from a Q1 2015 baseline), with the unemployment rate of each region reduced to not more than one percentage point above the national average.  </p>  <p>  This Government introduced the Regional Enterprise Development Fund in 2017 to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects to sustain and add to employment at county, regional and national level in line with the overall ambition of the RAPJs and the current Regional Enterprise Plans initiative. To date, the REDF has been delivered through two competitive calls with 42 projects across all regions securing a total of just under &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  On the 24 June 2019, I announced a further &euro;45 million Call 3 of the Fund. Eligible projects under this Call are currently being evaluated and I expect to be able to announce the successful projects following the completion of the evaluation process.</p></reply>

The changing demographics and the implications for future health care costs underpin the importance of developing a wider choice of appropriate housing options for older people. The objective is to encourage and facilitate timely planning by older people for their future housing needs, and to rebalance the care model away from residential care to supporting people to remain in their own communities for as long as possible. As the research shows, this reflects the preferences of older people themselves. </p><p>The aim is to ensure that older people will have more choice  by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can choose the right option for them. These options may include supported community developments akin to retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives.</p><p>Together with Damien English TD, Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal, I launched a Joint Policy Statement <i>&ldquo;Housing Options for our Ageing Population&rdquo;</i>earlier this year.<i></i>The purpose of this Statement is to provide a policy framework to support our ageing population in a way that will increase the accommodation options available to them and give them meaningful choice in how and where they choose to live.  </p><p>There are 40 Action points in the Plan and the document is available at . </p><p>An Inter-Departmental and Inter-Agency Implementation Group, with an independent Chair has been established to progress the programme of actions. The Implementation Group will report biannually to both myself and Minister English; the first report will be delivered this month. The establishment of the Implementation Group and the implementation of the policy statement are key actions in the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan. Many of the health related action points are influenced by and integrated with broader Sl&aacute;intecare actions.</p></reply>

The working group is expected to complete its work in early 2020. One of the outputs of the group will be a new code of governance for Task Forces in line with best practice in the community, voluntary and charitable sectors. My Department will support the implementation of this code of governance. This is an important step in strengthening the performance of task forces.</p>  <p>  Measuring the overall effectiveness of the response to the drug problem is an important objective of drug policy. Resources should be directed towards interventions and strategies which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem substance use and an improvement in public health, safety and well-being. </p>  <p>The level of progress achieved in delivering on the national drugs strategy Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery   will be determined using performance indicators. To this end, the Department of Health has committed to operationalising a performance measurement system by 2020. The system is primarily concerned with the overall effects of implementing the drugs strategy at a population level, including the effects on the health, well-being and quality of life of people living in areas served by the Task Forces.</p></reply>

These recommendations fall to be considered by a number of organisations including the Department of Health, the HSE, other state agencies and voluntary organisations themselves. It's also worth noting that many of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations dovetail with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and are being considered in that context.</p>  <p>  The key finding in the Report is the need to strengthen the relationship between the State and the sector and the Group identified the Department of Health as having a lead role in this regard. When I published the Report in February this year I announced my intention to establish a new Dialogue Forum as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. </p>  <p>  The Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations has now been established and I was delighted to address the first meeting of the new Forum which took place on Monday 2 December. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on Sl&aacute;intecare and other policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.</p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network.</p></reply>

Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors, as outlined above.</p></reply>

The study identified vegetables as the most significant dietary contributor for nitrate, and ham as the only dietary contributor for nitrite. The study concluded that exposure to nitrates and nitrites from food is not of concern.</p><p>The FSAI further advises that the safety of nitrate has been comprehensively evaluated by the European Union and international scientific experts, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN / World Health Organisation (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives.</p><p>The Authority states that salts of nitrate and nitrite have been used for curing meat and other perishable produce for decades. They also help hinder the growth of certain harmful microorganisms. The use of additives in food is strictly regulated by EU legislation which requires that only authorised food additives may be used in the manufacture or preparation of foodstuffs. At EU level, all additives approved for use in current legislation have been evaluated by EFSA or previously by its predecessor, the EU Scientific Committee on Food. Two main nitrite and nitrate salt forms are allowed as food additives. These are sodium and potassium nitrite and sodium and potassium nitrate. Nitrates and nitrites are permitted for use in foods such as raw and processed meats, processed fish, and cheese.</p><p>The FSAI points to a number of assessments/evaluations of relevance, including:</p><p>- In June 2017, EFSA re-assessed the safety of nitrate as well as nitrite. EFSA concluded that the exposure to nitrate resulting from its use as a food additive did not lead to an exceedance of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and was estimated to be less than 5% of the overall exposure to nitrate in food from all dietary sources. EFSA, however, noted that total dietary exposure to nitrate from all sources (food additives, natural presence and contamination) exceeded the current ADI in all European populations considered. Similar conclusions were drawn concerning dietary exposure to nitrites from all sources.  Nitrites contribute to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic. EFSA concluded that the formation of nitrosamines in the body from use of food additives at approved levels was of low concern for human health. However, nitrite unintentionally present in meat products from other sources such as environmental contamination can also contribute to the formation of nitrosamines. EFSA concluded that these levels of nitrosamines could give rise to potential health concerns but that more research was needed to address uncertainties and knowledge gaps in this area.</p><p>- In 2008, an assessment carried out by EFSA&rsquo;s <i>Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain</i>identified vegetable consumption as the main origin of human exposure to nitrate and to a lesser extent water and other foods.</p><p>- On the 26th October 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an agency of the World Health Organization, published the results of its evaluation of the risk of developing cancer from the consumption of red meat and processed meat.  While processed meat was classified as Group 1, &ldquo;carcinogenic to humans&rdquo;, it is important to understand that the classification system indicates the weight of the evidence as to whether an agent is capable of causing cancer and does not measure the level of risk. Further explanation of the IARC report is available on the FSAI website at: </p></reply>

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. Recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.</p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally. This winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme, and will provide additional home support and transitional care to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.</p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.</p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.</p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).</p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MR and Ultrasound.</p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.</p><p>- In Q3 there were a total of 170,034 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals).</p><p>">Waiting Lists</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) issues income guidelines to assist in determining entitlement to medical cards/GP visit cards. Any revision to the income thresholds must have regard for Government policy, increases in the Consumer Price Index and other issues which may be relevant.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that some changes have been recently made to both medical and GP visit card income thresholds. Budget 2019 made provision for a 10% increase across all GP visit card thresholds, which came into effect from April 1st, 2019. In addition, I announced in Budget 2020 that medical card gross income limits for those over 70 will be increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person aged over 70 (currently &euro;500 per week) and to &euro;1050 for a couple aged over 70 (currently &euro;900 per week), and will apply from July 2020.</p>  <p>  With regard to the estimated cost of increasing income thresholds in the manner sought, this information is not readily available at this time. However to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, it should be noted that my Department keeps medical card issues such as existing income thresholds under constant review.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides two thinning interventions for these types of forestry, regardless of whether they are grant aided. </p><p>The scheme facilitates the enhancement of the environment associated with thinning. Thinning stimulates investment through improvement, protection and development of broadleaf woodlands for a range of functions, including: healthy tree growth, landscape improvement, biodiversity enhancement, soil protection and water protection. </p><p>These aims will be achieved through improvement felling of malformed trees; felling of additional trees to release potential crop trees (PCT); pruning to improve stem quality; thinning or re-spacing to promote growth and management and re-spacing of natural regeneration.  Tending also benefits biodiversity by increasing light levels which contributes to the development of shrub and ground flora. </p><p>Following the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme, my Department made available a second element to WIS, Continuous Cover Forestry, in March 2019.  This element of the Woodland Improvement Scheme (WIS) will provide funding for conversion of existing forests to Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) over a 12-year transitional period.  No other element of WIS has been introduced.</p><p>It should be noted that the amount allocated each year is part of the overall allocation to the Forestry Programme.</p><p>Woodland Improvement Scheme payments (2007 &ndash; 2009) including shaping and pruning <table>    <tr>       <th>2007 </th>       <th>&euro; paid </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;390,104.70 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shaping </td>       <td>&euro;52,152.81 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pruning </td>       <td>&euro;130,222.20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2008 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;233,471.48 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shaping </td>       <td>&euro;56,517.75 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pruning </td>       <td>&euro;188,562.38 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;373,770.78 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shaping </td>       <td>&euro;83,380.02 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pruning </td>       <td>&euro;453,699.51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Paid </td>       <td>&euro;1,961,881.63 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Woodland Improvement Scheme payments (2010 &ndash; date) including Element 1, Thinning and Tending</p><p>2019 is amounts paid to 22 November, 2019. <table>    <tr>       <th>2010 </th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;248,169.67 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;610,339.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;163,613.58 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;750,192.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;70,006.85 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;971,412.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;64,841.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;864,411.99 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;76,117.62 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;665,570.00 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;27,593.03 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;469,500.00 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;21,654.22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;593,339.15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;29,153.44 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;603,117.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;17,451.45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WI Thinning &amp;amp; Tending </td>       <td>&euro;440,920.00 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Woodland Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;603,628.51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total paid </td>       <td>&euro;7,291,033.01 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These measures represent a key biodiversity component within Ireland&rsquo;s national forest policy as well as contributing to our climate change objectives.</p><p>These measures are as follows:</p><p>- Native  Woodland Establishment (as represented by Grant &amp;amp; Premium Categories 9 and 10 under the Afforestation Grant &amp;amp; Premium Scheme), which funds the establishment of new native woodland on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo;  sites; and</p><p>- Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, which promotes the appropriate restoration  of existing native woodland (including the conversion of non-native forest to native woodland), through the provision of financial support to forest  holders towards the cost of appropriate works.</p><p>Both measures have been developed and implemented in partnership with Woodlands of Ireland, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Heritage Council, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and other native woodland stakeholders.  It is envisaged that both measures will continue to develop over the coming years, based on the ongoing partnership, experiences gained and evolving priorities.</p><p>Following the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme, I increased grants and premium rates.  The grant available for Native Woodland Establishment, which both private land owners and local authorities can avail of, is &euro;5,620 per hectare. Under  the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme &ndash; Public Woodland a cost-based grant payment up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per hectare is available to local authorities and other public land holders.</p><p>In this regard, Coillte Nature, a new not-for-profit entity within Coillte, has announced its commitment to converting nine commercial Coillte forests in the Dublin Uplands (Ticknock, Barnaslignan, Carrigolligan, Kilmashogue, Ballyedmonduff, Massey&rsquo;s Wood, Hell Fire, Cruagh and Tibradden) to forests with the primary purpose of recreation and biodiversity.  Conversion from commercial forests to recreational forests will involve a mixture of conventional tree felling and replanting with native tree species, continuous cover forestry (CCF) and long term retention of other tree species. The project is being jointly funded by Coillte and the three Dublin local authorities with grants for native woodland conversion being provided by my Department.</p><p>As part of my Department's strategy towards meeting our objectives under the Climate Action Plan and under the National Biodiversity Plan, we plan to actively engage with all public bodies in the near future to encourage them to identify possibilities within their land bank for the establishment of native woodlands.</p><p>No applications have been received from local authorities under the Native Woodland Establishment or Native Woodland Conservation, although they have shown significant interest in accessing the Neighbourwood scheme.  This Scheme brings communities and woodlands together by helping local authorities and other landowners, both public and private, to create &lsquo;close-to-home&rsquo; woodland amenities in partnership with communities, for local people to use and enjoy.</p><p>Funding is available under three separate elements:</p><p>- NeighbourWood (NBR) Establishment funds the establishment of new neighbourwood on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites.</p><p>- NBR Enhancement funds the silvicultural enhancement of existing woodland already used as neighbourwood, or proposed for development as neighbourwood.</p><p>- NBR Facilities funds the installation and upgrade of appropriate recreational facilities within an area submitted under NBR Establishment or NBR Enhancement, or within an existing woodland suitable for recreation but not submitted under NBR Enhancement.</p><p>The following is a list of the applications received, and funding provided, to local authorities under the NeighbourWood Scheme:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Applicant</th>       <th>Number of Schemes</th>       <th>Amount Paid</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballina Town Council</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>&euro;123,696.80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow Co.

The Deputy's Question relates to a premises which is located in the AMBER area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed on 19 November with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p>  <p>  Work has already begun and a deployment plan will be made available by NBI shortly. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  Approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs), including schools, library hubs and local sports halls in every county in Ireland, will be connected to high speed broadband during 2020, to enable communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband. The BCP locations are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2021, NBI plans to pass approximately 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. NBI has indicated that the network rollout will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. </p>  <p>  With regard to the fibre installation close to the premises referred to by the Deputy, eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and not part of the planned State Intervention network. It is not funded by the State and is not planned, designed or directed by the Department in any capacity. The decision as to what areas and premises are served was made by eir internally and on a commercial basis. The Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that process.</p></reply>

The assessment identified technical and financial challenges, which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with international and EU experience, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether.  Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan, which includes the establishment of a working group in Q3 2019, sets out the steps necessary and timelines for the delivery of an enabling framework for microgeneration. The working group has been formed and is progressing the associated work programme.</p>  <p>  The Plan provides that a support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators by 2021 whilst ensuring principles of equity, self-consumption and energy efficiency first are incorporated. A public consultation/call-for-evidence of possible support mechanisms will commence in Q3 2020.</p></reply>

The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The Warmer Homes Scheme is delivered through a panel of contractors, appointed through a competitive tendering process. Some contractors have tendered to deliver all measures available under the scheme and others are only tendered to carry out shallow measures. </p><p>A number of Community Based Organisations (CBOs) are contracted to deliver shallow measures only. Therefore SEAI introduced strategic partnerships for those CBOs to allow them to gain experience on retrofitting deeper homes referrals. This involved certain CBOs partnering with other contractors, to deliver deeper homes. This has allowed those CBOs who are only contracted to deliver shallow measures to gain more experience in deeper measures and also to financially benefit from their work on these homes, even though the allocation has not been specifically made to them.

In accordance with the terms of the scheme&rsquo;s Ministerial approval, Repak ELT are obliged to work towards minimum targets of 30% recycling by the end of 2018 and each subsequent year of the approval. In 2018 the scheme exceeded the targets by achieving a 97% recycling rate, with 24% recycled in Ireland and Northern Ireland, 73% recycled outside the EU, mainly in India and Vietnam.</p><p>The remaining 3% of waste tyres was recovered in India (waste to energy). Repak ELT only funds recovery and recycling through brokers registered with the National TransFrontier Shipment Office in Ireland. The compliance scheme have confirmed that all of the outlets used in India for the recycling of End of Life Tyres (ELT) from Ireland are fully licensed and approved and meet their national environment and pollution standards. In 2018, site visits were conducted to a number of locations in India. These locations were verified as being permitted and licenced to import waste tyres. </p><p>The independent review of year 1 of the operation of the scheme was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website at  and circulated to key stakeholders for their information. The review suggests an over reliance on export markets for tyre recycling and recovery and I understand Repak ELT are working to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on all external markets and are committed to developing a more sustainable solution for the management of ELT in Ireland, in line with the proximity principle.</p><p>The review contains 15 recommendations which my Department is currently considering.</p></reply>

The consultation is looking at all aspects of current policy in relation to public transport and active travel. Details and background documents are available on my Department's website www.dttas.gov.ie and I look forward to engaging with the Deputy in shaping a new policy framework.</p><p>One of those background documents reviews the implementation status of the <i>National Cycling Policy Framework.  </i>This assessment, and indeed the wider policy review itself, will allow all stakeholders to reflect on what has been achieved, what remains to be done and how our policy frameworks can support the realisation of a more sustainable transport system and this assessment is an important first step toward realisation of Action 97&rsquo;s objectives. </p><p>Our policy review is also timely from the perspective of ensuring an appropriate and updated policy backdrop to the substantially increased levels of funding now available to support the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s (NTA) delivery of active travel infrastructure in co-operation with local authorities. The NTA has a statutory role in relation to the development of active travel infrastructure (including cycling facilities) and the Deputy will be aware that it has recently established a new Office to assist with the timely design and delivery of certain projects. </p><p>The focus in this area for the last number of years has been centred on increasing funding and the Deputy can be assured that the increases already secured will continue in the years ahead, the key area of focus now needs to be on delivery  and I look forward to the commencement of a number of important projects next year.</p></reply>

No. 355 of 2008), a helicopter can operate from &ldquo;any place where the aircraft may take off or land without undue hazard to persons or property and in respect of which the owner or occupier shall have given permission.&rdquo; The landing area and surrounding environment must be suitable and appropriate to the size and type of helicopter being operated. This responsibility rests with the helicopter operator, with the exception that where that place is of an elevated construction, located on the roof of a building or a structure, it shall also be licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority under this Order for such use by that helicopter. Elevated helipads have more stringent requirements and require specific approvals from the Authority. This Order allows the Authority to impose conditions on or prohibit operation of a helicopter to a site. </p>  <p>  With regard to civil helicopter operations to any proposed heliport, the prescribed characteristics and obstacle limitation surfaces to be provided for both ground level or elevated heliports, including normal associated facilities and technical services, are contained in International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), International Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS), Aerodromes, Annex 14 Heliports; and ICAO Heliport Manual Document 9261-AN/903.</p></reply>

This increased investment is showing a real return, with improved performances by our high performance athletes and a marked increase in participation across the population, including in hard-to-reach communities.

It provides a structured framework for organisations to assess, indicate and enhance their work and supports organisations to articulate their youth work practice using a common language. </p>  <p>  The NQSF operates on a 3-yearly cycle and was introduced nationally on a phased and incremental basis commencing in September 2010. Support and guidance for local youth work services is provided by the local Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth/Liaison Officer.  National youth work organisations will be supported by a NQSF Standards Officer.</p>  <p>  NQSF for Youth Work is currently being considered in the context of the new Targeted Youth Funding Scheme.</p></reply>

It supports stakeholders in making best use of the implementation structures established for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures implementation team are working on the 2019 Annual Report which will be published in 2020. Children and young people are being consulted as part of this process. </p>  <p>  The development of the next National Policy Framework for Children &amp;amp; Young People is being discussed within the Department. The National Youth Strategy, which is based on the National Framework, is part of this discussion. </p>  <p>  At a recent event with National Youth Organisations that I attended (2nd December 2019), there was significant positive discussion with key stakeholders about what should be carried over into the new strategy.  It was recognised at the meeting that any new strategy must have specific and measurable targets, with clear accountability and time-frames, especially given the fact that many actions will require cross-departmental collaboration.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to progressing this important work in the year ahead.</p></reply>

I have allocated significant funding in recent years for this purpose and for improving the quality of infrastructure nationwide.</p>  <p>  Capital strands are made available to achieve the strategic priorities for the year as determined by the Department, having regard to the funding available, developed using analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, learnings from previous capital programmes and feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers and Pobal. </p>  <p>  The Capital programmes are necessarily a budget limited exercise. Therefore, the maximum grant size available under each of these strands is determined in consideration of both optimising what can be delivered by each individual grant, as well as maximising the amount of providers and children that will ultimately benefit from the funding. </p>  <p>  Planning for 2020's Capital offering is currently underway and the details of this will be communicated to providers in due course.</p>  <p>  Childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan and &euro;250m in capital funding was secured for childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the earlier National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.</p>  <p>  This investment will be essential to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new National Childcare Scheme is introduced. The NCS will radically change how this country supports the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare.</p>  <p>  Research is on-going to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. The exact shape and priorities of this funding is currently being developed: more information will be made public on childcare plans under the NDP as it becomes available.</p></reply>

It removes many of the very restrictive eligibility requirements of the current schemes, linked to Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive supports. Moving to this new system will be a significant step forward in combating the poverty traps inherent in the current schemes. </p><p>Under the current targeted schemes, there are many families with low income-levels who are not currently able to access subsidised childcare, either because they are in low-paid employment or because they are rotating between short periods of employment, unemployment and training. The new Scheme will change this. Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive, and many new families will benefit for the first time. </p><p>The OECD's 2017 Faces of Joblessness report compared the child care supports for lone parents previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the National Childcare Scheme. It found significant improvement for lone parents. It found for example, that for certain lower paid lone parents working full time, the Scheme will bring net child care costs down from being the highest across the OECD, to 11th highest.<b></b>Of course, this analysis was conducted before Budgets 2019 and 2020 which have since further enhanced the Scheme for lone parents and other groups.  <b></b></p><p>Analysis of the impact of the new scheme conducted using the ESRI's SWITCH model indicated that, on average, the boost to disposable income by the NCS will be larger for one-parent families than for couples, reflecting the typically lower income profile of one-parent families. </p><p>Employed lone parents are the family type which will experience the greatest gains, with an effective average disposable income increase of &euro;48 per week.  </p><p>These findings reflect the very considerable work undertaken to poverty-proof the NCS<b></b>by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates. The Scheme is designed so that families who need the most support can receive it. </p><p>Parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week (rising to 45 hours from September 2020). This supports a key objective of the scheme which is labour activation and in particular female labour activation.  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; are set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and are comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.  The legislation also provides for &ldquo;bridging periods&rdquo; when a parent is moving between work and study.  </p><p>These inclusive arrangements will ensure that parents in a variety of work/study situations will be able to avail of the National Childcare Scheme.  </p><p>Arrangements are in place to monitor the success of the National Childcare Scheme in meeting its objectives, and the Scheme has been designed to be flexible and responsive. Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 provides for a review of the operation of the scheme to commence 12 months after the first payment of subsidies under the scheme. A report of this review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The stated policy intention of section 26 of the legislation was to ensure an early review of the Scheme to identify, in a timely way, any key issues or challenges which need to be addressed rapidly. A longer-term review will also be carried out after three years. </p><p>The Scheme also has a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework in place to support both ongoing and periodic assessment of the Scheme&rsquo;s success in meeting its objectives, including its objectives in supporting labour market activation and female labour market activation. It sets out the measures which policy-makers will use to monitor the Scheme on a continual basis, as well as to evaluate the Scheme at regular intervals, through a system of regular reporting by Pobal to the Department. </p><p>Under Budget 2020, the existing &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangement was extended, to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. In this Budget, additional funding was secured to extend the savers beyond August 2020. This means that persons who are registered on the CCS or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them indefinitely, for example, until they no longer require early learning and care or school age childcare.  </p><p>This and the other changes announced as part of Budget 2020 reflect the underpinning design of the Scheme to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.</p></reply>

It operates across many levels, and includes organisations such as Pobal, 30 City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs), and 7 National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs) which are funded by my Department to carry out a range of administrative, operational, communications and training functions in relation to ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  Investment in ELC and SAC has increased by 138% over the last five years, the number of ELC and SAC places has doubled, new schemes have been developed, including the recently opened National Childcare Scheme, and are serving twice the number of children than previously, and there has been significant development of policy, legislation and quality initiatives. Hence, my Department&rsquo;s commitment in First 5 to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the operating system is timely. </p>  <p>  The project planning phase for the Review is nearing completion and my Department expects to have terms of reference agreed in the coming weeks. My Department will lead on the review, with appropriate assistance from external bodies, and will engage with all relevant stakeholders during the process, including Early Childhood Ireland.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the project will aim to explore a variety of options in relation to how best the ELC and SAC operating system can be overseen by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in the coming years. The establishment of a single ELC and SAC agency is likely to be one of several  options for reform to be considered by the Review. </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of the Review is to ensure the operating system is equipped to implement DCYA policy to the standards required. The final system will support high quality, accessible and affordable early learning and care and school age childcare services to children and families through the efficient and effective administration of a number of programmes, schemes, quality initiatives, and other functions such a compliance and communications. The operating model will support service providers, operate transparently and accountably, provide value for money to the Exchequer and demonstrate good governance. The model will enable appropriate linkages and effective working relationships with all other agencies and Departments charged with delivering better outcomes for children and families.</p></reply>

As my Department does not have a role in relation to the processing of registration applications or maintenance of the register, it does not provide feedback to individual service providers on the status of their application.  </p><p>However, in relation to the processing of applications more generally, I am informed by Tusla that the total number of early years services that are due to re-register by 31 December 2019 is 4,117. As of 3 December, 2,232 applications had been submitted to Tusla's Early Years Inspectorate and a further 994 services had started the application process but had not yet submitted via the online portal for assessment. Submitted applications are currently being processed in batches through a series of specially convened registration panels.</p><p>All registered providers receive an automated acknowledgement from the Inspectorate on submission of their application via the online portal, and are advised directly by the Early Years Registration Office, following initial review, if they need to submit any outstanding documents. All registered providers are then advised when their applications are complete and receive a formal letter or registration from Tusla once their application has been approved by a registration panel.</p><p>In relation to applications not yet received, Tusla continues to highlight to registered providers the need to ensure that their applications are submitted in a timely manner in order to meet the statutory deadline for re-registration. Tusla has engaged with its Early Years Consultative and Regulatory Support Forum, which is composed of sectoral stakeholders and support organisations, to support services in the process for re-registration, where they have yet to submit an application.</p><p>In recognition of the difficulties many providers were experiencing in completing re-registration, Tusla decided to revise the time-line for submission of supporting documentation for re-registration. Under the revised arrangements, while providers must apply to Tusla by 12th December, they have until 30th June 2020 to provide <i>some</i>of the supporting documentation required, including on fire safety and planning requirements.</p><p>On 27th November, my Department issued a letter informing providers that Tusla has revised the time-line for submission of supporting documentation for re-registration. That letter provided clear guidanceon what documentation is required by the 12th December deadline and what can be submitted up until 30th June. </p><p>My Department has been working closely with Tusla to ensure adequate staffing is in place to process applications on time, and to ensure effective communications with providers. In addition, my Department has supported City and County Childcare Committees to give advice and assistance to providers that need help with re-registration.</p></reply>

Funding priorities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure our supports remain targeted at those most in need socially and economically. </p>  <p>  Initiatives such as the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, the Community Services Programme, LEADER Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, Seniors Alert Scheme, and other funding for community groups and social enterprises provide supports that are addressing the requirements of communities and areas facing disadvantage and issues of isolation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide &euro;1 billion over the next 10 years for rural towns and villages, while the Town Centre Living Initiative, a pilot programme aimed at testing approaches to the revitalisation of towns and villages, was launched in six towns in October 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to develop policy that can assist with the effective targeting of future funding. The Action Plan for Rural Development and the Strategy to Support the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Sector in Ireland include a range of measures which contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in both rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  The new Strategy to Support the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Sector in Ireland, &lsquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities', is an ambitious strategy which builds on the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development. It comprises high level objectives and associated actions to support communities, their representative organisations, and the community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising the next phase of rural policy for Ireland, to follow on from the Action Plan for Rural Development which reaches the end of its three-year lifecycle at the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  An extensive range of consultations has taken place to inform the new policy including a series of regional events and an online public consultation survey on the challenges and opportunities rural areas over the coming five years. The new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland. It will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural economies and communities and will identify policy measures which need to be put in place in order to achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>  Specific examples of other measures being delivered by my Department which are helping those who feel isolated or vulnerable in communities include:</p>  <p>  -  Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based      support for vulnerable older people living alone. During 2018, spend on the Scheme amounted to almost &euro;7 million, with over 19,200 applications for personal alarms approved. There have been a further 10,000 approved applications in 2019. This is an important programme which enables      older persons of limited means to continue to live in their own homes at the heart of their communities with confidence, independence and peace of mind.</p>  <p>  -  Since the start of 2018 to mid-2019, the supports provided through the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme led to the following achievements:-  Over 43,000 people were supported, of which 40% were from a jobless household and 31% were long term unemployed.- 16,502 people completed a lifelong learning course, 4,024 set up their own business, and 2,168 people got jobs- 334 social enterprises were supported- 3,066 community groups were helped</p>  <p>  -  Support for approximately 400 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across Ireland, which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. Ireland continues to enjoy the highest per capita concentration of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in the world.  I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in 2018 and this year I have built on that with a further &euro;500,000 in recognition of the contribution these groups are making to life in Ireland. A number of Women&rsquo;s Sheds have emerged in communities in recent times and in order to support this positive development I have decided to make this funding also available to these groups. </p>  <p>  -  Volunteering plays a critical part in empowering individuals to become more involved in their communities and is proven to assist with the development of mental health well-being. My Department is currently in the process of developing a draft National Volunteering Strategy which will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

The objective of the Dormant Accounts Fund is to support people who experience economic, social or educational disadvantage, or to assist persons with a disability. This funding will help the public library service meet the needs of a diverse range of individuals and communities, which will facilitate inclusion and participation by all. It will build on existing library services and develop new relationships with local agencies and groups to facilitate greater engagement with those communities. The public libraries play a very important role in assisting in the delivery of additional educational services to comply with our Sustainable Development Goals and this funding will increase their capacity to continue that work.</p></reply>

I welcome feedback on our programmes and schemes from communities so we can continue to do this. </p>  <p>  Policies recently published or in development include; </p>  <p>  -  Ireland&rsquo;s first National Policy on Social Enterprise, published earlier this year.</p>  <p>  -  &lsquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities&rsquo;, a five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland. &euro;1.2 million is being provided to support the implementation of measures in this strategy, which will include enhanced supports for the structures which drive local engagement in decision making &ndash; the Public Participation Networks and the Local Community Development Committees. </p>  <p>  -  A National Volunteering Strategy is in development, in consultation with all stakeholders. Supporting our agencies (Western Development Commission, Water Safety Ireland, Charities Regulator and POBAL) also helps communities.</p>  <p>  -  My Department is currently finalising a new rural policy which will build on the Action Plan for Rural Development and will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland. My objective is to publish the policy at the start of 2020. It will be forward-looking, and will seek to strengthen and build resilience in rural economies and communities.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above policies developed by my Department, Project Ireland 2040 recognises the economic and social importance of rural Ireland through the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which is administered by my Department with the objective of strengthening rural economies and communities. </p>  <p>  Other funding supports provided by the Department are also available to voluntary and community groups across the country, including town and village supports, community and voluntary supports and other initiatives. Details of these programmes are available on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to work with colleagues across Government to drive positive rural and community development and to deliver policies and initiatives that consider the economic and social needs of all communities, regardless of location.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the work of my Department is benefiting all communities and delivering on our mission statement. I am determined that this will continue to be the case and that available funding and supports continues to deliver positive visible impacts for all of our communities, including County Kildare, on a fully inclusive basis.</p></reply>

Some of these successful projects include:</p>  <p>  -  The major upgrade of the Emo Court Estate in County Laois is to create a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; tourist attraction for the region which will benefit the nearby rural community which was allocated &euro;1.2 million in the first call.</p>  <p>  -  The redevelopment of the Athy Heritage Centre (former Town Hall) to  become the Ernest Shackleton Centre, leveraging tourism potential and benefiting the community which was allocated &euro;2.7 million in the first call.</p>  <p>  -  This regeneration of existing library in Trim and the adjacent chapel to provide a multifunctional space that will include an extended library and a theatre.  This project was allocated &euro;3.7      million in the second call.</p>  <p>  -  The regeneration and restoration of  two listed buildings and a derelict site in the centre of Ballinamore to provide a digital hub and co-working space, an artistic space for promotion of local arts and crafts and a youth facility.  This project was allocated &euro;1.7 million in the second call.</p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model, including the provision of a heritage or tourism facility. Funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution towards the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions including a manager where appropriate. The CSP contribution must be co-funded by the organisation concerned from other sources, for example, from income received from the public use of their services and facilities. Some &euro;46m is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme has provided funding for projects in and around historic sites. Projects may cover a range of activities, from tourism initiatives, improving the public realm to make towns and villages more attractive to job-creation initiatives. On 31 October last I announced the 2019 scheme with an allocation of &euro;15 million. Full particulars regarding the application process and scheme criteria have been provided to the Local Authorities who administer the scheme on behalf of my Department. The criteria for the award of funding for the 2020 scheme has not yet been decided.</p>  <p>  The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure, and for the necessary maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural areas. I recently announced funding for 109 Measure 1 projects to the value of &euro;1.8 million under ORIS 2019. I will shortly be making further announcements in relation to mid-sized and larger projects which have applied for funding under separate strands of the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme</p>  <p>  This type of project may also potentially be funded under the LEADER Rural Tourism sub-theme. The project promoter must submit an Expression of Interest to the Local Action Group in their area which details the proposed project activity in its entirety. If the activity is deemed eligible, the promoters will be invited to submit a full application to the relevant Local Action Group.  Contact details for all Local Action Groups are available at gov.ie.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Rural and Community Development works closely with that Department and with Local Authorities to help prepare rural communities for the roll out of high-speed broadband.  </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, which I chair and which is co-ordinated by officials of the two Departments, has successfully addressed a number of complex issues over the last three years that will not only help facilitate the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan but has also improved access to high-quality mobile phone services. Quarterly Progress Reports on the work of the Taskforce are published on the websites of both Departments, and on the Gov.ie portal.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development also supports the roll out of the National Broadband Plan through the network of Broadband Officers located in each Local Authority.  The Broadband Officers are co-funded by the Department and provide a vital point of contact for industry and the public regarding telecoms issues. </p>  <p>  The Broadband Officers are also leading on the development of Digital Strategies for each Local Authority.  These Digital Strategies will enable communities to make full use of digital technology in their daily lives, and will be particularly beneficial when the Broadband Plan is rolled out.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Rural and Community Development works closely with all local authorities to improve the availability of free WiFi connectivity through the country. My officials have been supporting the Local Authorities in registering and applying to the European Commission initiative WIFI4EU and so far, Ireland secured a total of 100 vouchers, amounting to &euro;1,500,000. The Department of Rural and Community Development is committed to match-fund each voucher secured up to &euro;15,000. This will significantly increase access to public WiFi throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department also plays a key role in relation to the establishment of the nationwide network of Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). The BCP initiative will see high-speed broadband services brought to approximately 300 sites, typically schools, community centres and sports clubs, in remote and rural areas across the country, ahead of the arrival of the National Broadband Plan network.</p></reply>

People in counties Galway, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon had higher average distances to most everyday services compared to other counties.</p>  <p>  However, living in rural Ireland has its advantages, including a better quality of life, great community involvement, and lack of congestion.</p>  <p>  It is not feasible to have a full range of high-end services in every single town, but we are putting initiatives in place to help people in rural areas to access services better.  These include improvements to rural transport through the Local Link service, and the roll out of high-speed broadband through the National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  We are also investing in towns, villages and communities through programmes such as CL&Aacute;R, LEADER, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, and the Community Services Programme, helping these communities to be more self-sustainable.  The new national Social Enterprise Policy will also support local services in sectors such as healthcare, childcare and supports for older people.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the next phase of rural policy to succeed the Action Plan for Rural Development which reaches the end of its lifecycle this year.  The new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to a range of matters impacting on rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My officials will reflect on the data in the recent CSO report in finalising the policy.</p></reply>

The aim of the charter was to encourage companies to consider and support young jobseekers currently on the Live Register when recruiting.  Companies are also actively encouraged as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda to develop and participate in initiatives to support and increase the employability skills of jobseekers.  This may include site visits, job shadowing, CV preparation, participating in up-skilling initiatives or attendance at recruitment events.<i></i></p><p>To date, 652 Employers have signed up to the Charter and these employers have undertaken 724 Activities. Since the upturn in the economy and the increased level of employer engagement in other vehicles to reflect corporate social responsibility (CSR) such as with Business in the Community Ireland and the Open Doors Initiative, the numbers of employers newly signed up to the Charter has reduced.

For example, during periods of unemployment, credits can cover these gaps in social insurance.  In order to qualify for unemployment credits a person must be fit for, available for and genuinely seeking work.  Credits can also be awarded for a day of notified incapacity for work, periods of statutory leave or while a person is in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for credits, an individual must previously have entered insurable employment and must have paid at least one PRSI contribution at Class A, B, C, D, E, H or P.  Contributions paid at Class J or S are not reckonable towards the award of credited contributions.</p>  <p>  In general, credited contributions can be awarded where a person has had a recent attachment to the workforce i.e. within the last  two  years.  Credits are usually awarded at the same class as the last paid PRSI contribution. For example, if a person paid Class A PRSI in their last employment and are eligible for credits, the credits will protect their potential entitlement to Class A social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  Separately, voluntary contributions are designed to maintain the social insurance record of persons who are no longer employees, or are self-employed and no longer making compulsory PRSI contributions.  The Voluntary Contributions scheme facilitates the payment of contributions directly to the Department on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions can help a person to qualify for certain long-term social insurance payments such as pensions in the future but they do not cover short-term benefits such as illness, maternity or jobseeker's benefits. </p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor, a person must be under pensionable age, currently 66 years, and have paid at least 520 weeks of compulsory PRSI from either employment or self-employment prior to application.  A person can apply to join the scheme within 60 months from the end of the year in which contributions were last paid.  A person must also no longer be covered by compulsory PRSI in Ireland and must not be covered by PRSI on a compulsory or voluntary basis in another EU country.</p>  <p>  It is advisable for any person seeking information on credited or voluntary contributions to contact their local Intreo office, who will be able to discuss options available to the person in order to maintain their social insurance record.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These are as follows:</p><p>-  Simplifying the path to legal gender recognition for children aged 16/17 years by introducing an arrangement for self-declaration, with parental consent; a simple revocation process; and by making family mediation support available on a voluntary basis. </p><p>-  In order to bring greater clarity to the fact that legal gender recognition is separate and distinct from any question of medical intervention, I propose to legislate to identify clearly on a gender recognition certificate for 16 and 17 year olds that it is awarded on the basis of self-declaration only.</p><p>-  To provide that a gender recognition certificate may be used to provide proof of change of name as well as proof of change of gender.</p><p>-  To provide that Irish citizens born outside the State and living outside the State (including Northern Ireland) would be allowed to apply for a gender recognition certificate.</p><p>The next step is for the general scheme of the bill to be referred to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>The Review Group report recommended extending legal gender recognition to non-binary people, while also recognising the complexity of the issue and acknowledging that a comprehensive impact analysis may be required. An interdepartmental group will be established shortly that will be tasked with carrying out this impact assessment and submitting a report to Government for consideration by the end of 2020. This group will include representatives from Government Departments and their agencies with significant involvement and interest in this area.</p><p>In the meantime, Government Departments and other public bodies will take positive steps to improve the position of non-binary people. This could include measures such as:</p><p>-  promoting the use and acceptance of correct pronouns;</p><p>-  improving the design of official forms and documentation to permit the use of a third gender option, or no gender at all, where it is possible to do so.</p><p>In addition to these measures I will also jointly commission research, in conjunction with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to examine issues of concern for children under 16 years. I have also agreed to a further review of the Act to be commenced within two years of the commencement of any amending provisions. Terms of reference for this work will be developed at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

The contract agreement between the Department and the Community Employment Sponsoring Body establishes their role as an independent contractor, responsible for all purposes and all persons recruited by them. </p>  <p>  Participants and supervisors on CE schemes are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding. My Department provides funding in respect of the participant and supervisors' payroll for individuals up to State Pension age.  CE Supervisors are not employed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In July 2008 the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors (LCR19293), and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, who were then responsible for CE.  F&Aacute;S was not a party to the LRC case.</p>  <p>  The issue of CE Supervisors&rsquo; pension provision was considered by a Community Sector High Level Group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).  All stakeholders were represented on the group. A detailed scoping exercise was undertaken and included input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service on the potential cost of providing Exchequer support for a pension scheme across the wider Community and Voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  Any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of those many thousands of workers in the broader sector.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie</i>. </p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>As matters currently stand, the position is that the scheme is based on the information that was available to the Board at the time of its adoption in February 2014 and having regard to the detail set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel (July 2012).  </p><p>The Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with a stakeholder consultation, to establish certain facts in relation to the potential exposure of pyrite in dwellings.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel, as possibly having pyrite.  At that time all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although the scheme was subsequently amended in February 2015 in the light of relevant information that emerged in the local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin with regard to pyritic heave in a small number of housing developments, i.e. one development in each of the two local authority areas.</p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence. The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.  I would support the view that similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.</p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information:</p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore;</p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite;</p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;</p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;</p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;</p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and</p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.  In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, i.e. do the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.  </p><p>The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie </p></reply>

The five-year programme proposed the construction or refurbishment of twenty-six fire stations. This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade or refurbishment projects.</p>  <p>  The Fire Services Capital Programme forms an important part of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to support fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service. The prioritisation and effective management of these resources is, in the first instance, a matter for each of the fire authorities based on their assessment of local needs and requirements.  My Department works closely with fire services around the country to progress priority projects.</p>  <p>  In order to maximise the Capital Programme funding available, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the capital programme on an annual basis and priority can be adjusted to bring forward more advanced projects offering best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects in the programme more generally.</p>  <p>  I understand there was an historic project application in relation to the fire station in Rathdowney that didn't eventually progress as proposed and that in 2017, Laois County Council put in place an extension on to Rathdowney Fire Station, consisting of separate male and female toilets, a shower cubicle and a new muster bay. While a fire station project for Rathdowney is not included in the current five-year programme referred to above, both Rathdowney and Stradbally are on the list for inclusion in annual reviews.

This project will give effect to improvements that, along with improving our national registration process, could also ultimately facilitate the registration of voters resident outside the State in the event of the referendum on extending the franchise in Presidential elections being passed. </p><p>The key policies being proposed are largely based on recommendations by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in its Report on the establishment of an Electoral Commission, published in January 2016.  This report considered the electoral register in some detail in the context of it being a function for the proposed Electoral Commission.  </p><p>Following an initial consultation with local authorities on a set of policy proposals, I launched a public consultation on the electoral register modernisation project in December 2018.  187 submissions were received from a broad range of stakeholders and a report on the consultation will be published shortly.  The seven key policy proposals included in the consultation document are:</p><p>- The simplification of the registration process and the forms used  <b>;</b></p><p>- The introduction of a rolling electoral register, rather than the current annual one;</p><p>- Optional online registration and secure self-service;</p><p>- A move to individual registration only;</p><p>- Enabling a single national electoral register database with unique identifiers;</p><p>- A move to verified identity using one&rsquo;s Personal Public Service Number (PPSN); and</p><p>- The provision for some limited data sharing between public bodies and electoral registration authorities to maintain accuracy and comprehensiveness.</p><p>As well as proposing the removal of the provision that requires an edited register to be produced, further policy proposals have also been put forward with the aim of making the register more accessible to all citizens.  These are:</p><p>- provision of a system of anonymous registration for people whose safety may be at risk if their details are included on the register available for inspection;</p><p>- improved provision for registration for those with no-fixed address;  and</p><p>- pre-registration for 16-17 year olds, with the registration becoming active on their 18<sup>th</sup>birthday.</p><p>The responses to the consultation are informing ongoing work in my Department on various aspects of the project, including, most immediately, the development of a simplified, standardised registration form.</p><p>As part of the consideration of the provision of an optional online platform for individuals to update their details, my Department is currently working with the Dublin local authorities to arrange an independent evaluation of their Voter.ie platform. This evaluation will assess its suitability for a national roll out.  In the run up to the electoral events in May of this year, voter.ie provided Dublin electors with an option to manage their register information online.  This was an option, in addition to the standard paper form, available to those with a Public Services Card and a related MyGovID.  Dublin City consider the pilot to have been a success with some 16% of applications being made via the portal.  </p><p>The Government will shortly consider this suite of policy proposals set out in the consultation document and the responses received. Preparation of a General Scheme of an Electoral Amendment Bill will then be progressed as soon as possible to give legislative effect to the proposals agreed by Government.</p></reply>

In the case of referendums specifically, the role of any Referendum Commission established for that referendum includes the promotion of public awareness of the referendum and the encouragement of the electorate to vote at the poll. My Department also undertakes an annual poster campaign to encourage voters to ensure that they are registered to vote.</p>  <p>  In July 2019 the Government approved the establishment of a statutory Electoral Commission.  A General Scheme of an Electoral Commission Bill is currently being prepared in my Department and I expect that it will be completed before the year-end.  It is envisaged that a voter education function will be assigned to the Electoral Commission.  This would involve the development of ways to increase participation in our political processes through voter education.  It will be a matter for the Electoral Commission to examine any existing schemes, when developing any new voter education programmes.</p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

By protecting and restoring these habitats, their carbon sequestration potential is maintained and improved.</p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for implementing the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2018, which underpins the protection of biodiversity and nature in Ireland. The legislative framework in place to protect our natural heritage is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also falls under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of those species listed on Annex 1 to the Directive as well as regulatory occurring migratory birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. Under Article 4 of the Birds Directive (Directive 2009/ 147/EC), six Special Protection Areas (SPAs), covering a total land area of c.1,671km&sup2;, have been classified for the conservation of breeding Hen Harrier populations in Ireland.</p>  <p>  When considering a site for designation, proposed sites are evaluated by scientists within my Department under a variety of selection criteria. These criteria include the contribution to the conservation of one or more species which are considered vulnerable, rare or endangered in Ireland, the importance within Ireland of the site for its habitats or species and the significance of the contribution to the conservation of one or more species which are protected in Ireland under national or international law that the designation of such land will make. </p>  <p>   Any afforestation proposals in Special Protection Areas designated under the EU Birds Directive require the completion of an Appropriate Assessment by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in accordance with Article 6.3 of the EU Habitats Directive. The primary test in such an assessment is the potential for the planting of the SPA land to have a significant adverse effect on the conservation interest of the species and site in question. As per European Union Guidelines for State aid, any afforestation within the SPAs must be agreed in advance by the Competent Authority responsible for designating Natura sites, that is to say my Department.</p></reply>

It was intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the Management Plan. </p>  <p>  The raised bog designated sites restoration programme can now be accelerated due to the announcement in Budget 2020 of &euro;5 million for peatlands restoration. </p>  <p>  Restoration plans for each of the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation have been drafted, to be developed further in partnership with stakeholders including landowners and local communities. Site specific restorations plans for the raised bog natural heritage areas are currently being developed by the Department using the most up-to-date scientific methodologies available and best practice models gained from other restoration projects. </p>  <p>  Restoration plans have been designed to ensure that the impact of the restoration works to surrounding agricultural lands is kept to a minimum. By raising the water table it is not intended to flood the land but, rather, to ensure that it remains wet enough to encourage the growth of sphagnum moss, which assists in the formation of peat within a protected site. </p>  <p>  In order to help allay concerns in relation to the potential impacts of restoration on areas of land adjacent to the designated bogs, the Department is in the process of developing drainage management plans for the majority of the raised bog special area of conservation sites as part of the restoration programme. Landowners and other stakeholders are being consulted as part of this process on a site by site basis.</p>  <p>  Work on the raised bog designated sites restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is funded under the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme. The Department is managing this project and is contributing &euro;1.352m, as well as ecological expertise, with the European Commission providing &euro;4.056m.  </p>  <p>  The Protected Raised Bog Restoration Incentive Scheme is operating on a pilot basis on the 12 &lsquo;Living Bog&rsquo; special area of conservation project sites. The scheme is available to eligible landowners and turbary right holders whose lands are within these special areas of conservation or on the fringes of the special areas of conservation but linked hydrologically or ecologically and where it is considered that compensation should be made available to gain access to lands for the restoration works and/or for any loss arising from the impact of these works. </p>  <p>  The scheme provides for the payment of once off amounts to eligible landowners and turbary right holders, the voluntary purchase of lands or the entering into a management agreement with the landowner.</p>  <p>  Applications to the scheme are being considered on a site-by-site basis. Applicants are required to complete an application form and provide proof of title to the land or turbary right. </p>  <p>  To date, under the pilot scheme, there are 36 applicants with payments processed to the value of &euro;303,168, with payment offers made to a further 28 individuals. </p>  <p>  If the pilot is considered successful, on review, it is intended that it will be rolled out to the remaining 41 raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas, in due course, as the national restoration programme is advanced.</p></reply>

Waterways Ireland have already re-opened two of the infilled graving docks and have provided assurance that these will remain open as part of any future development proposals.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland undertook a conservation assessment of the docks in 2018, which included a test trenching exercise under licence from the National Monuments Service, supervised by an Industrial Archaeologist.  The exercise confirmed that all three of the original docks have survived, with the possibility of the two open docks being restored, thereby enhancing the cultural significance of the site into the future. The conservation assessment concluded that the third, infilled dock should retain its historical significance under the hardstanding as archaeological heritage.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is currently considering options for taking forward the development of the City Block 19 site which includes the three graving docks.  Conditions of any proposed development will require adherence to the terms of the SDZ in relation to use mix of 40% Residential, 30% Commercial and 30% community and recreational or cultural.  It is the view of Waterways Ireland that such a development, under the terms of the SDZ, can be achieved whilst retaining the three docks in situ, using imaginative design and careful site methodologies.</p></reply>
