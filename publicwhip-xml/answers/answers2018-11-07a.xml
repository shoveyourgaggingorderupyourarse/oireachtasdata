However, I have no function in the selection process.</p>  <p>  Following the resignation of the previous Chief Executive, Tusla consulted with my Department and the Public Appointments Service and discussed the process of recruiting a new permanent Chief Executive Officer.</p>  <p>  Given the likely timelines associated with recruitment of this senior post, my Department secured approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for Tusla to appoint an interim chief executive officer from within Tusla&rsquo;s senior management team.</p>  <p>  The successful candidate at interview was Mr Pat Smyth. He was appointed to the role in an interim capacity with effect from 1st of October 2018. His appointment ensures continuity in the operations of Tusla&rsquo;s functions.</p>  <p>  I met with members of the Board on 1st October. Among other things, we discussed the Board's plans, considerations as to the specifications of the role and the intended recruitment process. This process will involve the Public Appointments Service running an open competition. It will also involve an element of executive search to help to identify suitable applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department will work with Tusla and the Public Appointments Service to assist as required with this recruitment. My Department will shortly engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to seek approval of the terms and conditions for the permanent Chief Executive post.</p>  <p>  This is one of the most challenging and important roles in the country. Tusla will have a budget next year of some &euro;786m, with more than 4,000 staff providing frontline services to vulnerable children and their families.</p>  <p>  It is essential that a candidate of the highest calibre is recruited to lead on the transformation and delivery of effective child and family services in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I appointed two new members to the Board in 2018 who have a professional background in Human Resource Management. I am confident that the Board will find the most suitable candidate for this important role.</p></reply>

Ms van Turnhout submitted her final report to me on 14th June.</p>  <p>  It contained a number of recommendations in the areas of safeguarding, management of the organisation, governance proposals and charities regulation.  The report suggested that the restoration of funding to Scouting Ireland should be clearly linked to the successful implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Board of Scouting Ireland subsequently confirmed its decision to fully implement all the recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland report. On this basis I decided on 25th June to provide Scouting Ireland with interim funding for a further three month period, up until the end of September.</p>  <p>  In providing this interim funding I requested that Scouting Ireland provide me with a further report by 24th September detailing progress in the implementation of the outstanding recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland.    This report was subsequently submitted to me on 24th September for consideration.</p>  <p>  At the end of September the former Board of Scouting Ireland voted to reinstate the Chief Scout as Chair of their forthcoming EGM. Shortly afterwards I received letters from the then Interim Chair &amp;amp; Mr Ian Elliott setting out their serious concerns about the Board's actions and it's ability to properly govern the organisation. Based on this correspondence and discussions I had with both I decided to further suspend funding for as long as the then Board was in place. A new board was elected at the EGM on the 6th of October.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the significant progress made by Scouting Ireland in terms of the implementation of the Jillian van Turnhout recommendations and in the essential governance changes committed to by the organisation.</p>  <p>  For this reason I have restored funding to Scouting Ireland until the end of April 2019.  I have requested a further progress report from the organisation by the end of March 2019 as well as copies of the independent barrister&rsquo;s report and the final Ian Elliott report of the individual case review he conducted.</p></reply>

Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best.</p>  <p>  The legislation establishing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was signed by the President on Monday, 2nd July.  The Act will be underpinned by detailed secondary legislation and formal policy guidelines.</p>  <p>  Work is currently ongoing on both of these and also on the development of regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services by the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate.</p>  <p>  These latter regulations will be introduced in advance of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to allow school-age childcare services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from its inception.</p>  <p>  With regard to the scheme's ICT system, my Department concluded a full open tender public procurement process earlier this year.  A contract was awarded and our IT development contractor, Codec, are busy working with officials from DCYA and Pobal to develop the system.</p>  <p>  Work is also underway on the governance, administrative and communication elements of the scheme.  Consultation and engagement with stakeholders is ongoing and, in the new year, a comprehensive awareness campaign will be launched for parents and the public, alongside training and information supports for childcare providers and other key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2019 provided for enhancements to the scheme which will ensure that an even greater number of families will now benefit from the scheme once launched.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-07a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110700065#WRB01600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his important question. Children in care are among the most vulnerable in our society. It is the role of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to ensure that their needs - in some cases very complex needs - are met. Some  children in care demonstrate a range of  emotional, psychological and mental health problems. </p>  <p>  This is particularly the case where they have experienced prolonged neglect and where they come into care at an older age, or where they have other needs to be met, such as speech and language and learning difficulties.</p>  <p>  When a child enters care, Tusla social workers consult with all of the key people involved in their lives, which of course includes the child themselves, relevant adults and professionals. This consultation helps Tusla develop a Care Plan that is tailored to the child's needs and to set out the best way to address these.</p>  <p>  If a child is presenting with a mental health problem, the child's GP may refer them to their local CAMHS service.</p>  <p>  If CAMHS support is not available, Tusla may seek other HSE counselling and therapeutic support. Tusla have also separately engaged private therapists to work with children, where their needs are not met elsewhere. Tusla do not collate national data on referrals of children in care to health services.</p>  <p>  I would like to note that CAMHS is a function of the Health Services Executive, which comes under the remit of the Department of Health. As data on the waiting times for CAMHS is not reported to my Department, I would suggest that questions on waiting lists are better directed to  my cabinet colleague, the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-07a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110700065#WRB01900"><p>I welcome the publication of a new report, &lsquo;A Social and Economic Analysis of the use of Legal Services in the Child and Family Agency (Tusla)&rsquo;, which explores the complex and sometimes fraught interaction of social work practice and the legal system.</p>  <p>  I believe that empirical research which contributes to our understanding of child care proceedings is vital in furthering their improvement and development.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank the report&rsquo;s authors Drs Carmel Halton, Gill Harold, Aileen Murphy, and Edel Walsh, all of UCC. The study was funded by the Irish Research Council, with Tusla as the partner organisation.</p>  <p>  The report provides thought-provoking perspectives on a number of issues. While its recommendations are principally directed towards Tusla&rsquo;s social work services, Tusla&rsquo;s educational welfare services, and to solicitors, the issues raised will also usefully inform officials in my Department and others as we continually seek to secure the best possible outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  These issues raised include, among others, problems surrounding court delays, court schedules, and regular adjournments; a need for training to allow social workers and legal professionals to develop a mutual understanding of each other&rsquo;s disciplines; and a need for increased specialisation among the judiciary.</p>  <p>  As an overarching theme, the report compellingly suggests that the increasingly adversarial nature of the legal system is obscuring the principle that in the resolution of all proceedings, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Supreme Court has previously held that child care proceedings should be &ldquo;in essence an inquiry as to what is best to be done for the child&rdquo;, but the evidence of this report suggests that this worthy aspiration is not always achieved in current practice.</p>  <p>  In this light, I am pleased to remind the Deputy of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing Review of the Child Care Act 1991. The Review is a thorough examination of the legislation governing the child care and protection system.</p>  <p>  Through this, we hope to address many of the systemic issues raised in this report. The report will assist my Department in the review of this Act, and its findings will help ensure that any new child protection and welfare legislation will work, in an improved way, for the benefit of our most vulnerable children.</p></reply>

The case was therefore managed under the policy for retrospective cases.</p>  <p>  This is a challenging area for Tusla, as social workers must balance child protection and fair procedures towards the person who is the subject of the allegation. A revised Tusla policy for such cases, which will replace the 2014 policy, will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that a culture of openness and integrity is essential in order to learn from the grievous mistakes of the past.  It is the duty of management and staff to correct mistakes when they happen, and the duty of the Board to hold management to account to ensure that this happens. It is my duty as Minister to hold the Board to account, and I will continue to do this.</p></reply>

The mishandling of the referral that related to Sergeant Maurice McCabe was properly described by Justice Charlton for what it was - administrative incompetence.</p>  <p>  Many of the concerns to emerge from the Disclosures Tribunal report had already been identified in the recent report of HIQA's statutory investigation into the management of allegations of child sexual abuse against adults of concern.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, after I was briefed early in 2017 on the appalling handling of a referral made about Sergeant McCabe, I directed HIQA to provide me with this report which was published earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Tusla has developed a comprehensive Action Plan in response to the HIQA report. The Action Plan was approved by the Board in September. Each action has a designated owner and a timeframe. The interim Chief Executive Officer, Mr Pat Smyth, has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the Tusla Action plan. I have established an independent Expert Assurance Group to oversee the implementation of this Action Plan. Work is ongoing in relation to this.</p>  <p>  While the Action Plan addresses a range of themes, with appropriate actions under each theme, a number of actions in particular aim to address the factors that can be attributed to the administrative incompetence that occurred. These include:</p>  <p>  the improved management of retrospective cases,</p>  <p>  the development of robust systems to strengthen interagency working on child protection referrals,</p>  <p>  the introduction of a formal performance management system,</p>  <p>  ensuring consistent implementation and quality assurance of policies at local level,</p>  <p>  and the implementation of secure and effective information management systems to support case work and best practice.</p>  <p>  Record management is a particular area for reform. It will be underpinned by the new National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) that went live nationwide in July of this year.  For the first time, Tusla social workers are working off an integrated national IT system for child protection and welfare services. The system replaces all previous methods of record-keeping, which varied from area to area.</p>  <p>  One of the findings of the Tribunal was that there were serious practice issues at local level. It is clear that while policies and procedures were in place, they were not followed in the instances which led to the horrendous allegations against Sergeant McCabe. Tusla has accepted that the practice and governance in this case was exceptionally poor and has commenced a HR process around the allegations of serious misconduct in this case. It would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on this process prior to its completion. However, I have raised my concerns with the Board of Tusla regarding these practice issues. Tusla is to provide me with a report outlining its planned actions in this area.</p>  <p>  I recently announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla in Budget 2019. Tusla will have some &euro;786 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;33 million over 2018. This will support the implementation of actions in the Action Plan. I will shortly issue my Performance Statement to Tusla setting out the issues I want to be addressed in its Business Plan for 2019. I can assure the Deputy that the issues arising from the Disclosures Tribunal and the HIQA statutory investigation will be appropriately prioritised.</p>  <p>  In the interest of balance, I must note that there is also a recognition  for the good work of Tusla professionals in the report. I believe that the majority of Tusla front line social workers act in good faith, and do very important work, to the best of their abilities. The dedication demonstrated by these front line workers, on a daily basis, makes a real difference to the lives of children and young people in Ireland.</p></reply>

In accordance with her Terms of Reference she was asked to provide me with a clear assessment of Scouting Ireland's governance arrangements.  Ms van Turnhout submitted her final report on the Review of Scouting Ireland to me on 14th    June. The report contained a number of recommendations in the areas of safeguarding, management of the organisation, governance proposals and charities regulation.  Ms van Turnhout also indicated that the restoration of funding to Scouting Ireland should be clearly linked to the successful implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>The Board of Scouting Ireland subsequently confirmed its decision to fully implement all the recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland report. On 25th   June I decided to provide Scouting Ireland with interim funding for a further three month period up until the end of September.  This funding was provided in view of the significant progress achieved by Scouting Ireland in the implementation of a number of the required recommendations and to provide it with an opportunity to implement the outstanding recommendations.</p>  <p>In providing this interim funding I requested that Scouting Ireland provide me with a further report by 24th September detailing progress in the implementation of the outstanding recommendations contained in the Review of Scouting Ireland.  This report was subsequently submitted to my Department on 24th   September for consideration.</p>  <p>  At the end of September the former Board of Scouting Ireland voted to reinstate  the Chief Scout as Chair of their forthcoming EGM. Shortly afterwards I received  letters from the then Interim Chair &amp;amp; Mr Ian Elliott setting out their  serious concerns about the Board's actions and it's ability to properly govern  the organisation. Based on this correspondence and discussions I had with both I  decided to further suspend funding for as long as the then Board was in place. A new board was elected at the EGM on the 6th of October. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the significant progress made by Scouting Ireland in terms of the implementation of the Jillian van Turnhout recommendations and in the essential governance changes committed to by the organisation.  For this reason I have restored funding to Scouting Ireland until the end of April 2019.  I have requested a further progress report from the organisation by the end of March 2019, as well as copies of the independent barrister&rsquo;s report and the final Ian Elliott report of the individual case review he conducted.</p></reply>

While the inspection report was critical of aspects of the centre, I was pleased to read that the young people in the centre were well cared for and, overall, their quality of life was good. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that there is a difference  between a young person  being absent without authority from a residential centre and being missing from care. Children are not detained in a residential centre.  As with any child, they may come and go to attend education, recreation or to meet with friends.  As with many young person, boundaries will be tested. Young people may be recorded as being absent without authority if they do not comply with their curfew. </p>  <p>  The data provided by the centre showed that there had been 220 absences from the centre without authority in the 28 months since the last inspection, in March 2016, and that 103 had occurred in the previous 12 months. The report did not state how many instances were missing from care, but noted that the 'missing from care' procedures were followed appropriately.  A child in care is considered to be missing when his or her whereabouts are unknown and the Absence Management Plan indicates concern for the child's safety. The report also says that managing challenging behaviour was an issue, but the young people were "not placed at risk". </p>  <p>  Inspectors found in one case, a young person  went for family contact  and used the opportunity  to abscond and placed themselves at risk by misusing substances.  The report  also noted that there was evidence that repeated high levels of risk taking behaviour by one child had prompted a response which resulted in an intensive residential program, which was due to begin.  If a child  is missing from care  the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to return the child may be required. These cases will require the following circumstances to exist:</p>  <p>  the child's Absence Management Plan suggests that there is a serious  and immediate risk to the child;</p>  <p>  all efforts to return the child by staff/carer have failed;</p>  <p>  it is unsafe for staff to attend the location where the child is.</p>  <p>  I was disappointed to read of  the accommodation's deficiencies as it is important that all young people in residential care are provided with a high standard of care however I note that the inspectors found that the centre is making plans to move to new premises.  In the period before the move, the centre outlined in their action plan that upgrades to kitchen facilities and furniture for other rooms have been planned and approved.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of this report, my officials have received assurances from Tusla on the findings. Tusla has advised that a follow-up from HIQA with respect to the premises acknowledged the progress made to date.</p>  <p>  Tusla's services are assessed against standards on how the children and young people are cared for in all respects.  This includes their well being, health and medication, their education and their accommodation.  An action plan to address any findings from the inspection is submitted to HIQA, and this is published alongside the inspection report.  Tusla is aware of the findings from all HIQA inspections and monitors actions being taken to address the findings.</p></reply>

This outlines the range of issues raised which will be addressed, following the timescale outlined in the agreed Action Plan. There has not been a request from Oberstown for additional resources to  deliver this Action Plan.</p>  <p>  I see this Plan as one of the ongoing measures which will bring about positive change in Oberstown and make it a safer environment for both young people and staff.</p></reply>

The young people are assigned an advocate that will work with them over a 6 month period.</p>  <p>  During the course of this year, Tusla developed an initiative called Creative Community Alternatives (CCA) which is designed to support the planned exit of children and young people who are in residential care or foster care, and to avoid those at risk being placed in residential care. The overall aim of the Community Care Alternatives is to enable children and young people at risk to live in their own communities with wrap around supports. </p>  <p>  Children and young people with extremely complex needs can display challenging and high risk taking behaviours, drug and alcohol issues, mental health issues, attachment issues, educational problems and family environmental issues.</p>  <p>  The broad ranging intensive wrap around supports provided through the Creative Community Alternatives are designed to meet the identified needs of each child or young person.</p>  <p>  One example is a nine month programme which works intensively with a child or young person who is identified at high risk of admission to care.  It is a partnership between Galway Roscommon Education and Training Board, Foroige and Tusla.  The programme sets goals and measurable outcomes for each young person.  There is a heavy emphasis on participation and citizenship.</p>  <p>  With the roll out of Community Care Alternatives in Galway, Tusla made a decision not to renew its Service Level Agreement in the Galway/Roscommon area with YAP Ireland.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also advised me that the decision not to renew the Service Level Agreement was communicated to the CEO of YAP Ireland and the Director of Services on 28 June, 2018 and a meeting was held in September 2018. </p>  <p>  I believe it is good practice for Tusla to review its services on a continuous basis, including the work carried out by Tusla staff in the Galway/Roscommon area through its Creative Community Alternatives plan. I have been assured by Tusla that the needs of children and young people in Galway will be met under the new arrangements.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to work with YAP Ireland in the region until the end of 2018 in line with the Service Level Agreement signed by both parties.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently engaged with YAP Ireland in relation to the termination of the Service Level Agreement.</p></reply>

I understand that 225 staff have retired or left Tusla during the same period.  </p>  <p>  I strongly support Tusla&rsquo;s important work and by 2019 I will have secured an additional &euro;110m for pay and service provision since becoming Minister in 2016. It must be acknowledged that Tusla is operating in a difficult recruitment environment. I am aware that Tusla Recruit, the Agency's in-house recruitment function, continues to be very proactive and I am advised that it has created or is in the process of creating panels for all grades. </p>  <p>  I understand Tusla's overall staff turnover rate was approximately 5.1% in September and this is a marginal improvement compared to September 2017 when it was approximately 5.9%. Tusla has established a Retention Steering Group to develop a new retention strategy and to implement an integrated approach to retention throughout the Agency. In addition, I am aware that Tusla has a Health, Wellbeing and Employee Assistance Programme, a Continuous Professional Development Strategy and the National Transfer Policy to support its retention strategy. Ultimately, Tusla expects these actions to increase its attractiveness as an employer of choice. </p>  <p>  With regard to  counselling supports, I am aware that the range of supports available across areas include social work support, family therapy, play therapy and one to one child counselling, such as that provided by CARI.  Children with a mental health problem may be referred to their local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Family support or family resource centres can also provide significant support for both children and families and will often work closely with the child&rsquo;s social worker.</p>  <p>  I have also committed to establishing centres for supporting children who have suffered sexual abuse. These centres should minimise trauma while accessing care or health services, and engaging with the criminal justice system.  The centres will bring together the protection, health, therapeutic and policing services and ensure child-centred services that minimise, as far as possible, any additional trauma for the child and their family. I also expect to see improved efficiency and effectiveness for the child being cared for by child sexual abuse support services.  This proposal has the agreement of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan TD and Minister for Health, Simon Harris TD.  An inter-departmental working group has been established to explore the arrangements associated with setting up these cross-agency centres to support children and families who have suffered from child sexual abuse and I expect a pilot project to be established in early 2019.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-07a.74.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110700066#WRC02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 41 together.</p>  <p>Supporting the delivery of high quality early learning and care for children and families is at the centre of my Department's work. In recent years, we have enhanced supports for quality childcare provision in many ways, including:</p>  <p>  Funding to support further and higher education, as well as continuing professional development, for staff in the sector;</p>  <p>  Increases in capitation funding across all programmes;</p>  <p>  Provision of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), which supports service providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience;</p>  <p>  Introduction of the Better Start national quality development service, which provides mentoring and training for providers to improve quality standards; </p>  <p>  Statutory inspection of services by Tusla (the statutory regulator) as well as the introduction in 2016 of early years education-focussed Inspections undertaken by the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills; and</p>  <p>  Capital grants to enable service providers to expand and improve their premises.</p>  <p>  Regarding the pay and conditions of staff, I have been unequivocal in my support for better pay and conditions for staff in the sector. However, there are 4,500 childcare businesses nationwide. Those businesses are the employers of the early years sector staff. Given this context, I must be clear that there are limits to the action my Department can take.</p>  <p>  I have engaged directly with the sector, and have suggested that one approach the sector could consider is applying for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) through the Labour Court, seeking a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years' sector. Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders. My Department would not be a party to the SEO process. However, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.</p>  <p>  I have also introduced practical steps to improve the conditions of staff in any way I can. I have introduced additional capitation into our childcare programmes wherever possible, such as:</p>  <p>  the higher rate of ECCE capitation for graduate-led pre-school rooms;</p>  <p>  the recent 7% rise in ECCE capitation;</p>  <p>  the increased capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators as part of AIM; and</p>  <p>  the programme support payment in recognition the administrative roles services play in delivering my department&rsquo;s programmes.</p>  <p>  I have encouraged services to use additional funding to support the pay and conditions of the hard-working frontline staff that make such a lasting difference to children&rsquo;s lives.  While I am aware that some service providers are reporting difficulties with recruitment and retention of staff, I am confident that the changes being brought forward by my Department will lead not just to higher quality early learning and care, but to a more robust professional environment for both staff and employers.</p>  <p>  I have outlined the Affordable Childcare Scheme in detail to the House on previous occasions; the development of the scheme, the expansion of the ECCE programme and the provision of increased funding and support measures for the Early Years sector are all aimed at increasing access to quality early learning and care for children while reducing the cost for parents, and providing greater income and stability for service providers. The development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme should not be seen as separate from the questions of quality and staff pay, as the scheme is intended to subsidise the cost of delivery of quality childcare, including helping services to meet the cost of staff wages, which are the main driver of overall costs.</p>  <p>  My Department has also commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare, which is examining the factors that impact on the cost of delivering quality childcare, including staff wages. When complete, this will inform future policy development and funding decisions.</p></reply>

The most recent Early Years Sector Profile 2016/2017 indicates that existing childcare provision in general meets the needs nationwide in terms of capacity. Latest available data from Pobal indicates that in general there remains no issue in relation to capacity.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to have secured &euro;8.86m in capital funding for childcare in 2019. While the precise details of 2019&rsquo;s Capital offering have yet to be finalised, this funding will be used to meet the most pressing needs of the sector with the ultimate aim of benefitting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published earlier this year, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities with &euro;250 million in additional funding to expand childcare capacity over the duration of the Plan.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that many parents opt to use childminders to care for their pre-school and school-age children. In recognition of this, I commissioned a Childminding Working Group whose report was published in March 2018. In response, I have made a commitment to develop and publish by the end of the year a childminding action plan containing short, medium and long term goals for the childminding sector.  This action plan will set out steps to move incrementally over the years ahead towards the wider regulation, support and professional development of childminders, along with a timescale for these to be carried out. My Department is currently developing the action plan, with the intention of publication before the end of December. </p>  <p>  Another significant element of the increased childcare provision in Budget 2019 is the allocation of &euro;0.5m to create a team of Childminding Support Officers to support the registration of childminders with Tusla and to help them upskill to the required regulatory standards to be introduced in the coming years. Only childminders registered with Tusla will be able to offer the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS).  </p>  <p>  The scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and- crucially- allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019 my Department again delivered as promised on the commitment to continue investing in our children and young people. Budget 2019 represents another significant step in ensuring access to high quality, affordable childcare and early years education. The additional &euro;89m in 2019 will allow for thousands of families to benefit under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

The organisation also provides a residential care service for young people. In 2018, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is providing &euro;1.6 million in funding for the residential component of this service.</p>  <p>  I have received correspondence from several members of the Oireachtas, including the Deputy, on this matter. I have also received detailed correspondence from the management of the Cottage Home  detailing the nature of the valuable work that they do, the cost pressures they are under and the reasons they wish to receive State funding for their family support service in order to ensure its sustainability. </p>  <p>  The provision of family support services is a matter for Tusla. I have raised the concerns of the Deputy and others regarding the future funding of this organisation with Tusla.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the family support service has been in operation for a number of years and to date, has been privately funded by the Cottage Home. It has not received funding from Tusla, or the Health Service Executive (HSE), which provided child and family services prior to the establishment of Tusla in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Tusla acknowledges the value and benefits of this service in the community it serves. Tusla has advised me that the Service Director and the Area Manager are familiar with services provided by the Cottage Home and have visited the service.</p>  <p>  I understand that, at the time when the Cottage Home made a request for funding, available resources for family support services had been allocated to services in the area. Tusla did, however, advise the Cottage Home to apply for funding through one of its funding streams, including support for Counselling, which would assist in the provision of some of its services. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it is currently compiling a Commissioning Plan for services in the area, which seeks to assign resources to areas of the greatest need, ensuring the best possible outcomes. Requests for funding from the Cottage Home will be considered in this context. The planning process will help inform any future spending in the area based on evidenced needs.

The main priority of their work is around the welfare of children and young people and on ensuring that concerns and problems around attendance are addressed before attendance becomes a crisis issue.</p>  <p>  In schools participating in the Department of Education and Skill&rsquo;s DEIS initiative (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the EWS has responsibility for operational management of two school-based support services: the Home School Community Liaison Scheme  (HSCLS) and   the School Completion Programme (SCP).</p>  <p>  The thrust of the HSCLS is preventative - to enhance pupils' outcomes, through improved attendance, participation and retention in the education system.</p>  <p>  The SCP aims to increase the numbers of young people staying in primary and second level school and in doing so improve the numbers of pupils who successfully complete the Senior Cycle or the equivalent.</p>  <p>  The latest figures available in the School Attendance Data suggest that whilst overall school attendance rates are very high there has been a very slight increase in the level of absenteeism between the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 school years. These being the latest figures available.</p>  <p>  The percentage of overall student/days lost through absence in a school year was 5.9% in primary schools and 7.9% in post-primary schools. These figures represent an increase of 0.3 percentage points in primary schools and of 0.2 percentage points in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that it is vital that all children are provided with all the assistance possible with attending school and in this regard my Department will continue to work with colleagues in the EWS and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that supports are available to those that need them.</p></reply>

Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the current targeted early learning and care subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  A universal  subsidy is available to all parents of children under the age of three, or whenever the child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme, regardless of whether parents are working or not. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, ACS, which is under development will make early learning and care subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  </p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.</p>  <p>  There has also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 also announced the introduction of a new parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently led the development of a Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families. The Strategy will include a range of measures to support families given the fundamental importance they play in shaping children&rsquo;s outcomes. I look forward to updating the House on those developments later this year.</p></reply>

Neither I nor my officials have been in contact with President Erdo&eth;an or other Turkish political leaders in relation to the death of Mr. Khashoggi. However, we are closely following the facts as they emerge through our Embassies in Riyadh and Ankara.  In addition, I met with the Saudi Ambassador on 18 October and stressed the widespread shock caused by the case and the necessity for a credible and open investigation, echoing High Representative Mogherini&rsquo;s call for a thorough, credible and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case, and for the perpetrators of the crime to be held fully accountable.  The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also met with the Saudi Ambassador on 30 October and again reiterated our concerns.</p>  <p>  The horrific details that are coming to light in relation to Mr. Khashoggi&rsquo;s death are of grave concern, and Ireland is deeply troubled by the egregious attack on press freedom that this killing represents.</p>  <p>  Press freedom is a fundamental right, and it is essential that journalists feel safe to pursue their work in any country. Together with our European partners, Ireland will continue to raise our serious concerns about all actions that undermine freedom of expression, including media expression, across the globe.</p>  <p>  I discussed this case with my EU colleagues at the October meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and I anticipate that we will return to the issue at the next meeting of the FAC on 19 November.</p></reply>

It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit. The Government is therefore firmly focused on protecting the full range of areas in which North South cooperation exists today in the context of the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the UK, and in doing so works closely with the Commission Taskforce.  This includes our involvement in discussions, where appropriate, while respecting the negotiations structures that have been mandated by the European Council.     At the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, officials carried out detailed work over October and November 2017 to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies. </p>  <p>  This included looking at the six North South implementation bodies, the areas of cooperation under the North South Ministerial Council, which cover agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism; as well as other areas where there is practical cooperation between North and South, including justice and security, energy, broadcasting and communications, inland fisheries, sport and culture.</p>  <p>  It has been made public that an initial listing established over 140 areas of North-South cooperation within this framework.  This number was identified in the early stages of the process and was not prepared by the Irish Government.  The listing provided a basis for further discussions in the course of the dialogue. </p>  <p>  The exercise overall highlighted how the maintenance and future development of meaningful North South cooperation relies on the EU legal and policy frameworks to give direction to this cooperation and to facilitate its operation.  The EU frameworks are both overarching and the foundation to North South cooperation in many instances.  Much of the cooperation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary; it is not easily quantifiable.</p>  <p>  The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December 2017 acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.  This is further reflected in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including in Article 8, the text of which has been marked green, meaning that it is agreed at negotiator level. </p>  <p>  As the mapping exercise was conducted by the EU and UK in the course of their dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland, joint publication of a final report is ultimately a matter for the EU and UK.</p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan TD, and I represented the Government.  The UK Government was represented by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington MP, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP Set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Conference brings together the Irish and UK Governments to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  Following on from the most recent meeting of the BIIGC, in London on 25 July, last week&rsquo;s meeting provided the opportunity to continue our discussions on legacy issues, security co-operation, East-West matters, and political stability in Northern Ireland.    At the meeting, we reaffirmed our commitment to implementing the framework established in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to comprehensively address the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past, taking account of the UK Government&rsquo;s public consultation on establishing the legacy institutions. </p>  <p>  On security-cooperation, both Governments recalled the commitments made in the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to ending paramilitarism and welcomed the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) established under that Agreement. In considering the findings and recommendations contained in the report, the Conference noted in particular the IRC&rsquo;s view that the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is essential to ending paramilitarism and achieving community transformation. </p>  <p>  The Conference discussed a joint paper by Irish and British officials which outlined a number of possible models to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit.  Both Governments agreed that these new structures for systemic bilateral co-operation should demonstrate the strength and depth of the relationship, provide opportunities for ministers and officials to continue to engage with each other, and provide an overall architecture for cooperation that is both meaningful and sustainable in the future.  As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving Heads of Government and senior ministers and would alternate between Ireland and the UK.  These summits would be supported by close bilateral work by ministers.  Officials on both sides have been asked to turn these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation for consideration at the next meeting of the Conference.</p>  <p>  The Conference provided both Governments the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements.  It was recognised that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have been essential for the progress made in Northern Ireland over the past two decades and that they remain the indispensable framework for the political process in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments reiterated their shared commitment to securing the operation of the devolved power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the consequent resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  It was agreed that the BIIGC would reconvene in spring 2019.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  The absence of the Executive also means that North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.    I am currently engaging with Secretary of State Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the full operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I met with Secretary of State Bradley in Dublin on 17 September, in Belfast on 8 October and most recently in Dublin last Friday 2 November at the British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference.</p>  <p>  Both Governments are continuing to engage with all of the political parties to seek a way forward to get the Institutions up and running again.  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and have provided views on their key concerns and issues. </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, I believe a new political process is required to get beyond the current impasse and secure the necessary agreement between the parties on operating the devolved institutions again.</p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of the institutions of the Agreement.</p></reply>

I also pointed out that taxing revenue rather than profits would undermine European competitiveness and could intensify already heightened trade tensions.</p>  <p>  While Ireland is among a number of Member States which object to the fundamental nature of the proposal, we are joined by a wider group which share our concerns on a series of technical issues yet to be resolved.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to global tax reform and believes that global solutions are needed to ensure tax is paid by companies where value is created.  That is why Ireland has been a committed participant in, and strong supporter of, tax reform efforts led by the OECD through the BEPS process.  Ireland will continue to actively engage with work in the area of the digital economy at both OECD and EU level.</p></reply>

A tax rate of 89 per cent is applied to any variable remuneration in the banking sector which is not regular salary, including remuneration awarded in shares. While this restriction on banking bonuses remains in place, I have committed my Department to tender for an external evaluation to determine whether the remuneration policy remains fit for purpose. </p><p>In addition, a high income individual&rsquo;s restriction (HYIR) has been in place since Budget 2007, limiting the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions by high income earnings individuals. Its aim is to balance the promotion of tax equity in relation to those on high incomes with the incentive effect of specified tax reliefs. The restriction works by limiting the total amount of specified reliefs that a high income individual can use to reduce their tax liability in any one tax year. A recent report on its operation in 2016, published by the Revenue Commissioners signals that the measure continues to work as intended. The declining levels of tax revenue associated with the restriction signify that the amount of income being sheltered from tax (and as a result falling within the HYIR) continues to fall. Those on incomes over &euro;400,000 (149 individuals) face an effective tax rate of 30 per cent, with average tax rates rising to 40.9 per cent once the USC is included. Some 372 individuals on incomes between &euro;125,000 and &euro;400,000 paid an average tax rate of 28.6 per cent once USC was included.</p><p>From a wealth monitoring perspective, the Revenue Commissioners have a dedicated High Wealth Individuals (HWI) unit within their Large Cases Division, which has been in operation since 2003. This is supported by an Anti-Avoidance function allowing for the specialised focus highlighted by the 2009 OECD report <i>Engaging with High Wealth Individuals on tax compliance</i>. As of June 2018, this unit which is responsible for profiling, risk assessment and tax compliance, was actively monitoring 480 high wealth individuals with wealth in excess of &euro;50 million. A sectorial decomposition of these individuals reveals a third are predominantly active in the real estate sector, with just 4 per cent active in the financial and insurance sector. The operations of this unit were reviewed in 2007 and again in 2015 with no change recommended. </p><p>Furthermore, the Controller &amp;amp; Auditor General&rsquo;s <i>Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2017 </i>outlines the State&rsquo;s management of high wealth individuals tax liabilities and notes the relatively high effective tax rate on income earned by HWIs who face a rate of 39 percent, compared to an average rate of 16.3 per cent for all tax payers.  </p><p>As regards transparency of information, from a data collection perspective the CSO publish earnings by NACE sector, including the Information and Communication, the Professional, Scientific and Technical, and the Financial Insurance and Real estate sectors. This forms part of the <i>Earnings Hours and Employment Costs Survey</i>(EHECS). Data are published on irregular earnings (bonuses), non-statutory social contributions (i.e. employer contributions to pension funds, life assurance and income continuance insurance), and benefits-in-kind (covering for example stock options, share purchase schemes, voluntary health insurance and company cars). </p><p>As regards data on wealth, the Central Bank publish a quarterly net worth of Irish households series. In addition, the CSO conduct the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS 2013), compiling comprehensive data on Irish household wealth. The net wealth Gini coefficient - a commonly used measure of inequality (where a figure of 100 indicates that one household holds all the wealth and 0 indicates that wealth is evenly divided among all households) indicates that wealth inequality in Ireland was lower (64) than the euro area average (69). The HFCS results also indicate that wealth in Ireland was less concentrated at the top of the distribution than the euro area average.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.  The Deputy will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 21 of 2018) was signed into law in July this year. The Act, inter alia, provides for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party personal injury motor insurance claimants including the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim. The Act also provides for revised arrangements for the on-going administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund, including for the relevant applications to the President of the High Court. These revised arrangements have now been put in place.</p><p>I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that a High Court date has been agreed for Monday, 19 November.  Payments can then be issued to qualifying Setanta claimants by the Agency within 10 working days of obtaining the funds from the Central Bank on foot of the High Court order. Therefore, based on this information, I anticipate that the next tranche of payments will be made to claimants in the late November/early December period.  </p><p>While I cannot comment on individual cases, the Agency has advised that the next tranche will comprise of: (a) newly settled claims requiring 100% payment, (b) all those cases where 65% was previously paid and where the balance of 35%  is due and (c) a number of third party legal costs payments. In total, it is expected that next tranche of claims will comprise in the region of 1,500 separate payments with a value of approximately &euro;21 million.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to court procedures. The liquidator of Setanta estimates that the process of settling the vast majority of these outstanding claims should be completed by end-2019.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers transparency and value for money outcomes.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for the formulation of policy, dissemination of best practice and guidance in public procurement.  I am not in a position to comment on whether or not a particular business is eligible to engage in future public contracts as it will depend on the circumstances of the business and the criteria that have been established for a particular procurement.</p>  <p>  An applicant&rsquo;s eligibility to participate in public procurement competitions must be determined in a manner that meets the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and mutual recognition.  Criteria for qualitative selection are defined in the EU Procurement Directive and essentially break down into two categories; exclusion grounds and selection criteria.   </p>  <p>  Applicants may be excluded from a procurement where their particular circumstances meet the grounds for exclusion defined in the Directive.  These break down to grounds that must be applied by the contracting authority which typically cover convictions for crimes such as money laundering, corruption, etc. They also include an applicant&rsquo;s failure to meet its obligations with respect to tax and social welfare payments.  There is a further range of grounds that a contracting authority may choose to apply covering such matters as insolvency, poor past performance, serious misrepresentation, etc.</p>  <p>  Selection criteria are applied to determine an applicant&rsquo;s financial and economic standing and their professional and technical capacity.

Enrolment of a child in a special school is based on a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with SEN, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.</p><p>The range of supports and services which are made available to schools include additional special educational support teaching, Special Needs Assistants support, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 150% from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now.  </p><p>While most schools fully embrace an open and inclusive policy, some students with Special Educational Needs continue to experience difficulties in securing enrolment. My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when fully commenced will assist in addressing these issues.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that, on the 3rd October 2018, my predecessor Minister Bruton, commenced a number of sections of the Act. On that date the Minister also announced the commencement of Section 8 of the Act, from Monday 3rd December 2018, which will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. </p><p>This power will come into effect on Monday 3rd December 2018. The NCSE will engage with the education partners and finalise procedures in advance of this date. This new power will build on the work which has been done in recent years to facilitate schools to open special classes.</p><p>Section 67 of the Act will provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment. </p><p>A number of the remaining sections of the Act which have not yet been commenced including Section 67, require regulations and procedures to be drafted, and will require consultation with the Education Partners prior to commencement.</p><p>I intend to have the other remaining sections of the Act commenced in time for admissions to the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>DES Circular 0010/2018 for primary schools set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools to support students with SEN enrolled in mainstream classes.</p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. </p><p>Where a school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year, additional allocations may be made.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts for the 2018/19 school year were set out in DES Circular 10/2018 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 7,8,9/2018 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p><p>The National Council for Special Education will be available to support schools where schools have developed and implemented appropriate plans for the deployment of their special education needs teaching resources, but the school considers that further support may be required. </p><p>The NCSE has published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>Should schools consider that they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, details of this review process are available at:</p><p>.</p><p>I can also advise that profiles for all schools are currently being reviewed, based on updated data, with a view to making revised profiled allocations for all schools effective from September 2019.</p></reply>

These reports were paid for by the Department of Education and Skills. The reports were &ldquo;The Economic Impact of a Technological University in Ireland: An exploratory study&rdquo; by Viewforth Consulting Ltd. Cost:  &euro;21,600.00 (VAT inclusive) and &ldquo;Development of the Technological University TU5: International perspectives and options&rdquo; by Emeritus Professor John L. Davie. Cost:  &euro;7,961    (VAT inclusive).</p>  <p>  Since 2013 Exchequer co-funding has been provided in relation to the development of technological university projects by consortia of institutes of technology. The most recent Exchequer allocations were made following funding calls in 2017 and 2018 administered by the Higher Education Authority in support of higher education landscape restructuring.  In this context the details  of any consultancy work commissioned by the Authority itself, including in the wider context of technological university development, or by consortia of institutes of technology, are matters for those bodies.</p></reply>

The standard approach on school building projects is to schedule such site meetings on a fortnightly basis through the construction period. A per project schedule of such meetings for the relevant projects is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Separate to the role of Employer&rsquo;s Representative, which is an external party appointed by the Department under the Public Works Contract, the Department&rsquo;s own technical staff act as client liaison on school building projects constructed under the Design &amp;amp; Build process.  The responsibilities of the client liaison include reporting on progress to the Department; bringing any potential programme delays to the attention of the Department; keeping the school community awaiting completion of the building informed of progress; involving the School Authorities in selecting of internal colour schemes, and ensuring that the contractor is aware of any particular project or school requirements. The client liaison is not involved in the certification of the works.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations introduced in 2014, an Assigned Certifier must be appointed.  Since 2014, the Department has appointed an independent qualified third party to act as Assigned Certifier on all Design and Build school projects. </p>  <p>  On school projects designed by the Employer, the lead Architect on the design team usually acts as the Assigned Certifier.</p>  <p>  The Assigned Certifier coordinates and implements an inspection plan through the construction process. </p>  <p>  At project completion, the Assigned Certifier gathers the ancillary certificates, which are provided by the contractor, its subcontractors and design team, and executes a Certificate of Compliance on Completion. </p>  <p>  The Assigned Certifier is not, however, responsible for the supervision of the builder.</p>  <p>  Since September 2017, in addition to the Assigned Certifier, the Department now appoints a full-time resident Clerk of Works on all major school construction projects. The role of a Clerk of Works is to represent the interests of the client with regard to ensuring that the quality of both materials and workmanship is in accordance with the architect&rsquo;s/engineer&rsquo;s drawings and specifications.  This includes inspection of materials and workmanship through the construction process. Clerks of Works are external appointments and are not Department staff.</p></reply>

That stock-take would inform future provision, co-location and shared use of facilities&rdquo;.</p><p>An initiative to map organisations, events, artists and locations at national, regional and local level throughout the country, as outlined in the Arts in Education Charter, is currently under development, and will be drawn upon for arts-in-education purposes. This mapping will be in the form of a national digital mapping/directory. This will be incorporated on the Arts-In-Education Portal () on an incremental basis, but with a substantial amount of the work completed by the end of this year. This will be a major resource for schools and all stakeholders and will also help to highlight areas of low provision, with a view to its remediation. This work is being overseen by the Arts in Education Portal Editorial Committee which was established under the auspices of the Charter.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Creative Youth, a plan to enable the creativity of every child and young person was published in December 2017.  This Plan aims to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, arts and coding by 2022.The actions in the Creative Youth Plan extend to both the formal and non-formal education sectors and are being delivered by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council. The Creative Youth is building on the Arts in Education Charter and aims to resource, fast-track and implement the objectives of the Charter.</p></reply>

The Arts Council are a designated body of the NCCA under section 42 of the Education Act.</p>  <p>  Section 4.11 of the Arts in Education Charter outlined that &ldquo;the Arts Council shall be consulted by the NCCA and, where appropriate, represented on its committees that address art education, creative entrepreneurship, digital media, and cognate areas of arts in education.  The Charter, launched in 2013, is a joint initiative of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht working in association with the Arts Council to promote arts-in-education.</p>  <p>  The NCCA is not represented on any of the Arts Council&rsquo;s committees. However, the NCCA have regular contacts with the Council on a range of relevant work and matters. For example, the Arts Council had a representative on each of the NCCA&rsquo;s Subject Development Groups for development of the Junior Certificate Visual Art and Leaving Certificate Art specifications recently. Most recently, the Arts Council have been consulted on the NCCA&rsquo;s draft Strategic Plan 2019 &ndash; 2021.</p></reply>

The Charter recognised the value of arts in education and committed to cross-departmental co-operation in this area.  A number of commitments were made as part of this process and much progress has been made across all areas of the Charter since its publication.  </p>  <p>  An High Level Implementation Group, chaired by the late Professor John Coolahan, was appointed by the Ministers of both Departments in 2013 to provide a strategic, high-level and ongoing point of contact with them to ensure the delivery of the Charter objectives.  The Group was made up of senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills, the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Director of the Arts Council, members also included Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick (and Chair of the Points of Alignment Committee) and Dr Katie Sweeney, National Director for the integration of the Arts in Education. Michael Finneran, Head of Drama and Theatre Studies, Mary Immaculate College, University of Limerick replaced Mary Nunan on this group in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Group has been active since 2013 and met with my predecessors and the previous Ministers for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Six formal reports were submitted to the Minister for Education and Skills and to the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  These reports will be uploaded to the Arts in Education Portal and will be available to view.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Creative Youth, a plan to enable the creativity of every child and young person was published in December 2017.  This Plan aims to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, arts and coding by 2022.   The actions in the Creative Youth Plan extend to both the formal and non-formal education sectors and are being delivered by my Department, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council. This Plan is building on the Arts in Education Charter and aims to resource, fast-track and implement the objectives of the Arts in Education Charter as well as rolling out a range of other initiatives.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new Expert Advisory group chaired by Dr. Ciaran Benson has been established by Minister Bruton, in his previous role as Minister for Education and Skills, Minister Madigan and Minister Zappone. Their role is to drive the implementation of Creative Youth and the continued roll out of the Arts in Education Charter.  They will also advise on the broader long-term objective for the Creative Ireland Programme: to enhance cultural and creative education for all our children and young people.</p></reply>

Enrolment of a child in a special school is based on a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p>  <p>  The Department therefore provides for a continuum of provision which includes mainstream school placements with additional supports, or for pupils who require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible for the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  There are 4 special schools and 27 special classes in mainstream schools in Co. Westmeath. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy supports students with ASD and complex needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week. The Department consulted with the NCSE when planning the new school build for this school. The NCSE is satisfied that the additional accommodation this project will deliver will meet future potential need for such placements. </p>  <p>  The new school project will deliver a new 2-storey 6-classroom base Special Needs School including a General Purpose Hall, all staff and pupil facilities, allowing for the school to accommodate an additional class for 6 students with ASD and complex needs, should it be required in future years.  </p>  <p>  As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.

In this model, residents are allocated a number of points depending on their family composition and these points are used to procure the ordinary day to day household needs of residents. Items that can be procured under this system are ingredients for cooking, toiletries and other household items.</p><p>Currently five centres have  moved to the independent living model.

Meath</td><td>600</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services under the independent living model will be advertised. This process is scheduled for completion in 2020 and will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire state.</p><p>In parallel with the delivery of the full independent living model, a number of other accommodation centres have provided self catering facilities with fresh food provided by either the contractor or the resident themselves.  These centres include St Patrick's in Monaghan, Kinsale Road in Cork and Ocean View and Atlantic House in Tramore.</p><p>The statistical breakdown sought by the Deputy is not readily available. An analysis of the relevant centres will be carried out and will be forwarded on to the Deputy as soon as is practicable.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act allows for applications for Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs) to be made to the Labour Court by a trade union or an employer body either individually or jointly. The Court must then examine and assess the application against the criteria set down in the 2015 legislation. </p>  <p>  The Sectoral Employment Order (Construction Sector) 2017 came into law on the 19th October 2017. The rates of pay and other terms and conditions, including sick pay and pension schemes, set out in the SEO apply to every worker of the class, type or group in the economic sector to which the order applies, including agency workers.</p>  <p>  In the event of a dispute as to the rates that should apply and to whom, the SEO sets out the dispute resolution procedure that applies. Essentially, this provides that in the first instance efforts should be made at local level to reach a resolution by giving notice in writing to the employer. Failing a resolution at this point, a complaint may be made to an adjudication officer of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In the case of an individual dispute, the outcome of the adjudication hearing can be appealed by either party to the Labour Court. In the case of a collective dispute, if the issue remains unresolved locally, it will be referred to the conciliation service of the WRC. If the issue remains unresolved after conciliation, it will be referred to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to:</p>  <p>1.  What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>2.  What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  On June 21 2018, the Council of the PSI approved for issuance for public consultation the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018. This public consultation commenced on 17 July and ran until 14 August and afforded any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on the 20 September 2018 where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  </p>  <p>  I understand that since that date the PSI has undertaken to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.  The redrafted Rules will require approval of the Council of the PSI before a public consultation phase. Subsequent to any public consultation phase the draft Rules must again be approved by the Council before submission for my consent. This Council approval is not anticipated until early in the New Year. </p>  <p>  Correspondence outlining the concerns of registered pharmaceutical assistants has been received by my Department. My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my approval. I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgement. This includes consideration of concerns raised by, or on behalf of, registered pharmaceutical assistants.</p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

The report is available on the Department of Health website. The report sets out how personalised budgets could work as a funding mechanism for people with a disability, providing them with greater choice and control over the services and supports they receive. </p><p>Having reviewed the national and international research evidence and consulted with service users and their families, the report of the Task Force advocates three different models of how personalised budgets might be accessed by people with disabilities: </p><p>1.Person-managed fund, often referred to as Direct payments; </p><p>2.Co managed with the service provider; </p><p>3.Broker managed fund. </p><p>The rationale for several models is a recognition of the fact that no two people are the same and therefore, &lsquo;one size does not fit all&rsquo;. The Task Force recommended that the Department of Health and the HSE should establish demonstration projects to test the delivery of personalised budgets. These demonstration projects will test the three models with a view to identifying the best approach to the wider roll-out of these payment models following the initial demonstration phase. </p><p>The Department of Health, NDA and the HSE are in the process of designing the demonstration projects, and the Department&rsquo;s website will be kept updated with information on the roll out of the demonstration projects as it becomes available.</p></reply>

The guidelines contain detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and guidance on which cannabis products are appropriate for medical use. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation in the form of three Statutory Instruments. This work will be finalised once cannabis-based products, to be included in the legislation, can be sourced. </p>  <p>  Whilst medical cannabis products are not medicines, ensuring that such products meet appropriate quality standards when they are made available to the Irish market is a critical aspect of facilitating safe access to medical cannabis for Irish-based patients. Department of Health officials are working intensively on this issue to ensure a supply of appropriate medical cannabis products from other EU Member States and further afield to meet the needs of Irish patients. However, the Department of Health has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel such companies to supply their products to Irish market. </p>  <p>  Until these products are available in Ireland, it will be a matter for the prescriber and their patient to source the prescribed medical cannabis-based product. It is understood that patients who have been prescribed such products under Ministerial Licence have sourced them from the following Pharmacy in the Netherlands: Transvaal Pharmacy, Kempstraat 113, 2572 GC The Hague.

However, it cited the requirements under its Code of Standards and Behaviour, the Consultant Contract and the Ethics Acts as the bases under which individuals must refrain from any activity which causes a conflict of interest. </p>  <p>  The requirements in the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies also apply to doctors and other senior officials working in the HSE and other public bodies.   </p>  <p>  The regulator of the medical profession in Ireland is the Medical Council.  The Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics also sets standards for the conduct for doctors regarding gifts or payments they receive from pharmaceutical or other commercial companies. </p>  <p>  The Guide states that if doctors are paid, directly or indirectly, by pharmaceutical, medical device or other commercial companies or organisations to conduct medical research, they must make sure that the payment does not influence their study design or interpretation of research data. They must also address any potential conflict of interest and disclose the payment in any publication of research results. It also states that doctors should not accept gifts (including hospitality) from pharmaceutical, medical devices or other commercial enterprises. This does not prevent those doctors attending educational meetings or receiving payment of reasonable fees for professional services to commercial enterprises. </p>  <p>  If they are involved in any way in promoting or endorsing specific healthcare products or services, they must declare any financial or commercial interest they have in the organisation or company providing the products or services.</p>  <p>  Since the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the HSE, I have referred it also to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

All stocks of fish are inspected by Marine Institute Inspectors on 14 occasions throughout the year. As part of this control strategy farm operators are required to undertake treatments to control lice infestation levels once certain trigger levels are reached. In certain circumstances treatments alone may not be the most appropriate strategy and in a number of limited circumstances an accelerated harvest may be required. </p><p>These protocols are more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons: </p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry. </p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspection is published and made widely available. </p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>The sea lice monitoring and control programme in Ireland has been acknowledged by the Environment Directorate (DG Environment) of the EU Commission as representing international best practice.</p></reply>

The objective of the pilot scheme is to help build a sustainable, enduring micro generation sector in Ireland including setting appropriate safety and qualification standards for the industry.</p><p>Micro generation, was also appraised as part of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a financial support scheme (payment) for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p><p>My Department currently offers  opportunities for SMEs to avail of supports for Solar PV and other energy efficiency measures through the SEAI-led Better Energy Communities scheme, details of which can be found <i>www.seai.ie/grants/community-grants</i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></p></reply>

The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018.

Emissions from road vehicles in general, and from diesel vehicles in particular, are a key source of negative health impacts from a range of air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), black carbon and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially in urban areas.  Any factor which may increase these emissions, or circumvent legally mandated controls on them, is a matter for concern.  However I understand that, with a few rare exceptions such as vintage vehicles, any second-hand car imported into Ireland from Northern Ireland will be required to undergo the National Car Test (NCT) if it is more than four years old and the period of validity of its MOT has expired, at which point its emissions will be tested. </p>  <p>  For further information on this question, or on matters relating to the NCT, I would refer the Deputy to the Department of  Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

According to data for Q3 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed almost 210,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account. I always stress to Councils the importance of prioritising roads when allocating their own resources.</p>  <p>  My Department's regional and local road grant programmes include a Safety Improvement Works scheme. Under this programme local authorities submit a list of projects each year in order of priority for consideration for funding.  Within the constraints of the overall roads budget, allocations are then made to local authorities as part of the annual grant allocation process. The Cavan County Council proposals for Safety Works in 2019 will be considered under this process. It is expected that the 2019 Grant Allocations for regional and local roads will be announced in January 2019.</p></reply>

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  I have now initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will, in particular, examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  The review process will begin with a targeted consultation meeting with a number of people who are recognised for their background and expertise in relation to rural development issues.  This meeting is scheduled to take place in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The review will also involve more detailed stakeholder consultation and will inform future launches of the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2019 and beyond.

For information, in any one week, circa 50,000 customers are entitled to an IB payment. Last week, circa 54,000 customer payments were made, approximately 4,000 payments in excess of the normal level, and this includes some customers due arrears. For any customers with arrears outstanding, the Department would like to assure them that they will receive their back payments as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>   The Department can confirm that a normal level of payments will issue to IB customers this week. It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week. This is due to issues such as delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim, all of which can lead to payments being suspended or delayed. This was always the case. </p>  <p>   However, the Department acknowledges that the majority of the delays over the past few weeks were due to system and processing issues rather than normal levels of exceptions and would like to again apologise to the customers affected.</p>  <p>   In August, the IB scheme migrated from an old legacy IT system approaching its end-of-life to a more up-to-date system already successfully used for many of the Department&rsquo;s other payments. As part of this process, IB payments transitioned from a payment in arrears to a real-time payment model. This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.  Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.</p>  <p>  The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments. The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues - allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Similarly, unaccompanied minors who entered the State and were in the care of TUSLA prior to entering the direct provision system are exempt from the reduced rates of JA. My Department actively engages with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.</p>  <p>  Supports are also available to vulnerable young people under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, notably through the exceptional needs payment (ENP) which helps meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. For example, to end September 2018, the Department made some 360 rent deposit support payments to young people under 26, with expenditure of some &euro;250,000. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes and who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee. The aim of the EU-wide Youth Guarantee, supported by central EU funding of &euro;6 billion, was to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed.  Many of the elements of a Youth Guarantee were already in place in Ireland prior to the EU Recommendation, so the implementation of the Irish Youth Guarantee focuses on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to secure sustainable jobs.  Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market.</p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment. For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.0% in October 2018.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 14.9%.</p>  <p>  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth was given access to the data from the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Longitudinal Database to examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities. They examined the data for 18 and 19 year olds as the reduced rates were first introduced for this cohort. Their findings found positive results noting an overall reduction in unemployment durations.</p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which I launched on 24 September 2018 is a new work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers, aged 18 to 24, who are either long-term unemployed or face significant barriers to employment.  All participants will receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week from my Department. Participants whose underlying entitlement is in excess of that amount will continue to receive their weekly payment with an additional top-up allowance of &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance (CA) is a means-tested payment, made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that they require that level of care.  An increased payment can be made where full-time care is being provided to two people.</p>  <p>  At the end of September 2018 the average waiting time for a decision on a new CA application was 17 weeks. Additional staff have also recently been reassigned to the CA area to work on claims processing and this should lead to a reduction in processing times.</p>  <p>  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to CA, evidence must be provided in respect of the carer&rsquo;s habitual residence in the State, the level of care they provide, their means and also that the person being cared for has such a disability that they require full-time care and attention. </p>  <p>  In general, social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process. This is compounded if the documentary evidence provided at initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient; this is sometimes the case with carer&rsquo;s allowance applications. </p>  <p>  The Department recently launched a re-designed CA application form. The new form includes a Care Report section which has been arrived at through consultation between officials and medical assessors of my Department and representatives and members of Family Carers Ireland.  It is expected that the new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents' assessable income.  </p>  <p>  Assessable parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues.  Rent or mortgage repayments are then disregarded, where appropriate, and, finally, a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;30 per week in respect of each additional dependent child is also disregarded.  The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege to the claimant.  This weekly value is deducted from the maximum personal rate applicable to determine the level of weekly entitlement.  Where the level of entitlement as calculated is at least &euro;1 per week and less than &euro;40 per week, a minimum rate of &euro;40 per week is payable.  </p>  <p>  All social welfare payments are included as assessable income with the exception of the following: Fuel Allowance, Child Benefit, Carer's Support Grant, Guardian's payments, and Domiciliary Care Allowance.   </p>  <p>  However where a social welfare payment such as Carer's Allowance is the only source of parental assessable income, there would be no means assessed from benefit and privilege against the claimant, as the level of disregards would be higher than the level of weekly payment.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he should bring it to the attention of the Department.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are some exceptions to assessing benefit and privilege.  No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse / civil partner / partner is living with his / her parents.

For information, in any one week, circa 50,000 customers are entitled to an IB payment. Last week, circa 54,000 customer payments were made, approximately 4,000 payments in excess of the normal level, and this includes some customers due arrears. For any customers with arrears outstanding, the Department would like to assure them that they will receive their back payments as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>   The Department can confirm that a normal level of payments will issue to IB customers this week. It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week. This is due to issues such as delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim, all of which can lead to payments being suspended or delayed. This was always the case. </p>  <p>   However, the Department acknowledges that the majority of the delays over the past few weeks were due to system and processing issues rather than normal levels of exceptions and would like to again apologise to the customers affected.</p>  <p>  In August, the IB scheme migrated from an old legacy IT system approaching its end-of-life to a more up-to-date system already successfully used for many of the Department&rsquo;s other payments. As part of this process, IB payments transitioned from a payment in arrears to a real-time payment model. This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.  Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.</p>  <p>   The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments. The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues - allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. </p><p>The allocations and recoupment profiles for capital Traveller accommodation projects can vary across local authorities given local priorities, circumstances and project timelines as set out in the TAPs.  Local authorities adopted the fourth and current round of TAPs in 2014, with five-year rolling programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller accommodation.

An annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out, on a short-term basis, i.e. for 14 days or less at a time, of a person&rsquo;s entire home where it is their primary residence.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a Short Term Letting (STL), they will require planning permission to do so unless the property is already permitted to be used for tourism / short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to STL can be sought and it will be up to each local Planning Authority to consider applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners to prepare for and adapt to the new laws. In addition to revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which have been prepared, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals; drafting of these amendments is currently underway.</p>  <p>  Any unauthorised development, including breaches of the proposed exemptions, may be the subject of planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority.</p></reply>

While it was hoped that the Bill would be published before now, the complex nature of some of the issues involved in drafting the legislation has required additional time to work through. The Bill is expected to be published during the current D&aacute;il term.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the regulation of the social housing provider sector for the purposes of ensuring proper governance and the financial viability of the sector. This is to ensure that the State&rsquo;s contribution towards Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and tenants&rsquo; interests in relation to those housing assets are safeguarded.  Similarly, the Bill will provide assurance to tenants, the public and investors that the sector is well regulated. </p>  <p>  Currently, AHBs have to be approved under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  In anticipation of the introduction of the new statutory regulatory framework under the Bill referenced to above, an interim Regulation Committee for the AHB sector was established in 2014 under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a Regulation Office based within the Agency, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code (VRC) for AHBs. </p>  <p>  Since the Code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from my Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the voluntary code.  Only those AHBs that have undergone a satisfactory assessment as part of the annual assessment process by the Regulation Office are considered eligible for funding for the provision of social housing. At present 256 AHBs, including all the larger Tier 3 AHBs, encompassing some 95% of the AHB social housing stock, have signed up to the code. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, as part of its regular on-going management operations, the Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands, when appropriate. Every year, as part of this on-going management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced. Deer have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and also wet woodlands, within the Park (e.g. by bark stripping of mature trees and preventing regeneration). </p>  <p>  The Department commissioned a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in Killarney National Park. The study found that the total estimated red deer density over the entire study area of 13.64km2 was some 708 deer.  A further census of areas of the Park was commissioned by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and conducted in Spring 2017. Following consideration of these reports, population surveys, on-going monitoring by staff and scientific advice, my Department commenced a cull in January 2018. </p>  <p>  The cull in Killarney is carried out by trained, experienced and dedicated NPWS staff in a professional manner and is based upon scientific research. As part of this managed process, more than 120 deer have culled since January 2018. It is not possible to estimate how many more deer will be culled in 2018 due to weather and other factors. The following points should be noted: </p>  <p>  - The 2018 cull was decided upon following consultation with NPWS professional staff, including scientific input as required. </p>  <p>  - Shooting of deer in the Park is carried out only by NPWS professional staff members, who are fully trained, competent, expert and licensed in the use of firearms. </p>  <p>  - The selection of deer shot is in accordance with normal deer management protocols. The deer are shot humanely by qualified NPWS marksmen. </p>  <p>  - The remains are processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of officials from that Department.</p>  <p>  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p></reply>

The Charter recognised the value of arts in education and committed to cross-departmental co-operation in this area.  A number of commitments were made as part of this process and much progress has been made across all areas of the Charter since its publication.  </p>  <p>  An High Level Implementation Group, chaired by the late Professor John Coolahan, was appointed by the Ministers of both Departments in 2013 to provide a strategic, high-level and ongoing point of contact with them to ensure the delivery of the Charter objectives.  The Group was made up of senior officials from the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills, the Director of the Arts Council, Orlaith McBride, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick (and Chair of the Points of Alignment Committee) and Dr Katie Sweeney, National Director for the integration of the Arts in Education. Michael Finneran, Head of Drama and Theatre Studies, Mary Immaculate College, University of Limerick replaced Mary Nunan on this group in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Group has been active since 2013 and met my predecessor Minister Humphreys (on 14 October, 2014) as well as Minister Deenihan and previous Ministers for Education and Skills. Six formal reports were submitted to the Minister for Education and Skills and to the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  These reports will be uploaded to the Arts in Education Portal and will be available to view. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Creative Youth, a plan to enable the creativity of every child and young person was published in December 2017.  This Plan aims to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, arts and coding by 2022.   The actions in the Creative Youth Plan extend to both the formal and non-formal education sectors and are being delivered by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council. This Plan is building on the Arts in Education Charter and aims to resource, fast-track and implement the objectives of the Arts in Education Charter as well as rolling out a range of other initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, a new Expert Advisory group chaired by Dr. Ciaran Benson has been established by myself, Minister Bruton, in his previous role as Minister for Education and Skills and Minister Zappone.  Their role is to drive the implementation of Creative Youth and the continued roll out of the Arts in Education Charter.  They will also advise on the broader, long-term objective for the Creative Ireland Programme: to enhance cultural and creative education for all our children and young people.</p></reply>
