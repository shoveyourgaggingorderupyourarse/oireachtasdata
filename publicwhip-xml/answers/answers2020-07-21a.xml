    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-21a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100069#WRB01200"><p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the Ballyvourney and Ballymakeera flood relief scheme is currently at outline design stage.  The preferred options of the scheme are now nearing finalisation.</p><p>My Office is aware of the &lsquo;high&rsquo; water quality status of the respective water body in the area around Baile Mhic Ire and Baile Bhuirne.  The Project Team is currently assessing the potential impact of any proposed flood relief measures in that respect, and engaging with the Project&rsquo;s Environmental Consultants in order to ensure that suitable mitigation requirements are implemented, and appropriate processes to comply with statutory provisions are followed.  This is obviously an important consideration, and resolving some outstanding issues is taking longer than had previously been envisaged.  Nonetheless, it is hoped that the scheme can progress to Public Exhibition within the coming months.</p><p>When these considerations have been successfully finalised and provided the proposals are broadly accepted by the public and the stakeholders and the scheme is technically, environmentally and economically viable the scheme will proceed to detailed design stage and formal Confirmation by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995 following which construction can commence. </p><p>Work commenced on the development of the flood relief scheme for Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney following recent severe floods and the conclusions of the Lee CFRAM study commissioned by my Office, which included an investigation on the flood risk associated within the village.</p><p>The main sources of flooding along the River Sullane arise when the capacity of the river channel itself is exceeded, along with the three tributaries to the north of the village, including a storm network, which can independently cause flooding through the gullies and overland flow.</p><p>As with all schemes, a site investigation was completed to assist in determining the preferred options and in order to develop accurate costings for the project.  Among the environmental considerations that have presented, the presence of freshwater pearl mussels necessitated an additional survey and a proposal to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for translocation, which has been subsequently approved.  </p><p>My Office held a Public Information Day in Ballymakeera in March 2018, where the relevant stakeholders and members of the public were invited to provide feedback on the emerging preferred option.  This is an important element in the development of a scheme as local knowledge can provide valuable background information for the scheme.</p><p>As the Ballymakeera Study Area has notable environmental and fisheries&rsquo; sensitivities, it is essential that the environmental screening of a range of options is considered carefully, having regard to sensitive environmental constraints in the area.  This necessitated the preparation of a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) and an Operation and Maintenance Plan, which, in line with legislation, need to be completed prior to the finalisation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR).  My Office engaged engineering consultants, Byrne Looby, to finalise scheme drawings for this purpose.  Once these are complete, the environmental consultants, RPS, can then finalise the EIAR. This overall process has taken slightly longer than anticipated and, accordingly,<i></i>a Public Exhibition of the preferred scheme is now expected to take place later this year.  This will give the community an opportunity to examine and provide formal comments and observations over a four-week period. </p><p>In the interim, Cork County Council has been approved funding under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection scheme an additional &euro;187,248 in October 2018 for the provision of temporary flood defence measures including a sand bag defence structure, two non-return valves at existing drainage outfalls and pumping sumps to allow over pumping during flood events. Final approval for a Part 8 planning application is currently being progressed by Cork County Council, and following this approval, works will then commence. </p><p>A Preliminary Invasive Alien Species Management Plan (IASMP) was prepared for the Scheme identified the presence of invasive species around or close to the works area of the FRS, including Giant Knotweed, Japanese Knotweed and Himalayan Knotweed.Cork County Council has appointed Japanese Knotweed Ireland to undertake the planned treatment of these species in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works, and have confirmed that a second round of treatment of knotweed was completed in September 2019.</p><p>My Office continues to liaise with Cork County Council and local representatives and all stakeholders are very committed to progressing this Scheme.</p><p>The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period 2018-2027. Provision for the cost of the Scheme is included in the Office of Public Works' multi annual capital allocation.</p></reply>

The current position is as follows: </p>  <p>  The engineering design consultants have finalised the Stage I options report and updated the planning report for the scheme in light of updated survey information and consultations with relevant stakeholders and with CCC and the OPW. The flood waters in the area receded in early April and this enabled completion of the onsite inspection and walkover survey required to finalise the Environmental Assessment and report. Planning drawings have also been finalised recently. </p>  <p>  CCC has been in contact with land owners affected by the proposals and has consulted with local residents. The Council has indicated that it will shortly submit the proposed scheme for planning approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to carry out the proposed development, to which end, a notice will appear in the newspaper shortly.</p>  <p>  A Natura Impact Statement, along with an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) Screening has been prepared in respect of the proposed development. The Board may give approval to the application for development with or without conditions or may refuse the application for development. A copy of the Natura Impact Statement and plans and particulars relating to the application may be inspected free of charge at the offices of Roads section, Clare County Council, &Aacute;ras Chontae an Chl&aacute;ir, New Road, Ennis, Co.

Taking into account the additional expenditure agreed by the D&aacute;il, the revised Government Expenditure Ceiling now stands at &euro;79.7 billion. This includes an additional &euro;6.8 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, nearly &euro;2 billion for the Department of Health and &euro;483 million for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  Not included in these allocations are a number of measures announced by the Government in response to the Covid-19 crisis. These include in particular the decisions in relation to extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to August and the provision of additional funding for the Department of Transport in relation to the Public Service Obligation. Accounting for these and decisions in a number of other policy areas in response to Covid-19, the overall increase relative to the allocations set out in REV 2020 is almost &euro;12 billion.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, in order to support the economy as businesses and society reopen, further supports are to be announced as part of the July Stimulus plan. The plan includes a number of measures to provide additional targeted supports to stimulate activity across the economy, assist firms and support employment. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, in addition to the costs outlined above, funding is also to be set aside to support key sectors including Health, Schools, Third Level and Justice taking account of challenges arising from Covid-19. This funding will be allocated later in the year. </p>  <p>  Upon the formation of this Government a number of reconfigurations of Government Departments were announced. Work is underway within my Department to finalise these transfers of functions. Restated Estimates will be presented to the Dail in due course upon the completion of this work that will set out revised allocations reflecting the new Departmental structures and decisions in relation to additional funding to respond to Covid-19, including that set out in the July stimulus. </p></reply>

I note the Labour Court recommendation from 2008. I have been advised by my officials that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. I understand that this matter was discussed extensively at discussions of the Community Sector High Level Forum between public service management, which included inter alia officials from my Department, and union representatives a number of years ago. My Department carried out a detailed scoping exercise in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the Exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. </p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue. While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent a small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, consideration must be taken for the potential liability to the State if similar claims are made by the many workers in the broader community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, we are now facing huge challenges in managing the public finances. However, I intend to consider all the issues involved and will engage constructively with the relevant stakeholders. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-21a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100069#WRB02100"><p>The proposed flood relief scheme for Crossmolina, Co. Mayo is progressing broadly in line with the current programme.  Some delay has been experienced in recent months due to the consultants being unable to carry out the final environmental surveys during the nationwide Covid-19 shutdown.  To minimise these delays, the project team worked to progress all other tasks that could be safely carried out, such as desk studies, and continuing work on the preparation of documentation that will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) for formal Confirmation of the scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945</p>  <p>  Since the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions, the consultants have carried out the final elements of the environmental surveys and the project team is now in the process of finalising the documentation for the Confirmation process. It is anticipated that the scheme will be submitted to MPER in Quarter 3 of this year. </p>  <p>  Once submitted for Confirmation, the Minister will carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment as he is required to do which will involve an independent review of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report submitted with the scheme and the holding of a public consultation on the scheme. If the Minister Confirms the proposed scheme, the next stage in the process will be completion of the detailed design and the tender documents for the procurement of some specialist works contractors. It is planned that the main scheme works will be carried out by the OPW's direct labour force.</p>  <p>  In order to expedite this timeline, the project team will commence the preparation of the tender documents in parallel with the Confirmation process. While some amendments to the tender documents may be required following the Confirmation process, it should be possible to progress with the procurement of contractors as soon as possible following Confirmation. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure you that I am very aware of the concerns of the residents and businesses of Crossmolina to have protection from flooding without further delays.  The provision of effective flood defences to Crossmolina is a priority for me and for the Government. We want to ensure that the scheme that is built is technically and environmentally sound. I know that the OPW, Mayo County Council, and the scheme consultants have worked extremely hard to advance the scheme in what has been a complex environmental situation.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal Confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.   </p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER. I am advised that the current position on the Confirmation process is that a request for tender of services for environmental consultants is currently being progressed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). </p>  <p>  The public consultation phase is also due to be commenced by DPER shortly.  DPER will progress the formal Confirmation process, having due regard to the detailed requirements of the 2019 regulations. </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this point in the process to give specific dates for commencement of works given that there is always a possibility that further information and/or revision of the scheme&rsquo;s design may be required, as provided for under the Confirmation process. It should be noted that DPER is also progressing Confirmation of two other significant flood defence schemes for the Glashaboy and Bride Rivers in Co. Cork, both of which were submitted prior to the Enniscorthy scheme.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  Discrimination against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size or remuneration where such remuneration has not be provided for in national legislation could be considered in breach of the EU Procurement Regulations. There are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing the procurement rules.</p>  <p>  Specifically, EU Regulations require tenderers to be compliant with relevant employment law in order to participate in a public procurement process. The Directives make it clear that non-compliance with the relevant obligations may lead to exclusion of a tenderer from the procedure for the awarding of a public contract. The obligations on suppliers in relation to compliance with employment law are reflected in the suite of tender documentation for goods and services developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p>  <p>  In relation to the inclusion of the living wage in public contracts, there is no legal basis in Irish law or national agreements to make this a requirement on suppliers who wish to engage in public tendering. In addition, at EU level, any attempt to set wage rates through public procurement is also likely be viewed as discriminatory and in breach of the EU Treaty principles and the EU Procurement Directives.

Consequently, the inclusion of strategic public policy considerations in procurement processes is a key feature of the Programme for Government. Therefore, my Department is focused on ensuring that public procurement affords opportunities for SMEs to benefit from the significant tender opportunities carried out each year across the public service.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10/14). These include:</p>  <p>  -  Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value);</p>  <p>  -  Contracting authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  -  Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs participating in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; and</p>  <p>  -  Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.</p>  <p>  In addition, the SME Advisory Group which is comprised of representatives from ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF, and meets on a quarterly basis to ensure that SMEs have a platform to assist in the development of procurement policy and practice. Communication is a key factor in encouraging SMEs to engage in public procurement processes. To this end, the OGP established a sub-group of the SME Advisory Group to deal with this area. This group further promotes awareness of potential opportunities and supports available for SMEs in tendering for public contracts.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and development agencies to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participates at promotional events held across the country which are designed to help SMEs.</p>  <p>  The most recent Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report for 2017 published last December involved an analysis of &euro;4.912 billion expenditure across 71 public service bodies. The report indicates that 94% of the analysed expenditure is with firms within the State and 54% is with SMEs unchanged from 2016 and up from 52% in 2015. This report also analyses 2017 tendering activity in the public service as recorded on the eTenders public procurement platform. That analysis shows that 75% of tender notices are smaller value (below OJEU threshold) tenders. The median (typical) estimated contract values for tenders analysed in 2017 is &euro;90,000 and is less than or equal to &euro;100,000 in 14 of the 16 spend categories. This indicates that Government contracts in Ireland are accessible to SMEs given the low median size of estimated contract values.</p>  <p>  This is an important issue for Government and the OGP will continue to proactively engage with business to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

A key aim of these reforms is to increase transparency around the budgetary process and to facilitate greater meaningful engagement on key elements of the Budget and on what is being achieved with public funds.</p><p>A central part of these reforms is the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework. Rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day, this refers to an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities, alongside the publication of a range of documents to enhance engagement throughout the year. </p><p>Greater emphasis has also been placed on improving and supporting the evaluation capacity of Government Departments in recent years. This has led to the development of a number of additional processes and reports to support the budgetary framework. This includes:</p><p><b>-  Performance Budgeting - </b>A key objective of the Performance Budgeting Initiative is to shift the focus away from the quantum of spend and towards outputs and impacts.  The Public Service Performance Report presents performance information in an accessible manner and aims to facilitate discussion around what is being delivered with public funds and how this impacts the citizen. </p><p><b>-  Equality Budgeting &ndash; </b>Equality budgeting involves providing greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and/or ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process. An OECD &quot;Policy Scan&quot; Report on Equality Budgeting was completed in 2019, and was published on Budget Day in October last, setting out a number of ambitious objectives to progress this aspect of the budgetary reform agenda.  </p><p><b>-  Spending Review</b>- This process aims to place evidence at the heart of policy making, by systematically examining existing spending programmes with a view to assessing their efficiency and effectiveness. This approach can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.  In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed. </p></reply>

National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  In this regard, public procurement rules include provisions that allow Member States to require a contractor to comply with EU and National legislation on the protection of labour rights. As a consequence, public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.  They must also be compliant with relevant employment law. These requirements are set out in the template documents used in tendering for goods and services which have been developed by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.</p>  <p>  The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  In relation to Works contracts, once awarded, the conditions of the Public Works Contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site. Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

Many countries are seeing the number of infections increase again. In Ireland, the NPHET recently emphasised its growing concern regarding the following:-</p><p>&middot; The increase in case numbers of this disease currently being reported in the community and a number of large clusters that have emerged in recent weeks;</p><p>&middot; The R number is likely now to have exceeded 1, with the best estimate in the range of 1.2 and 1.8;</p><p>&middot; The deteriorating international epidemiological situation and international experience which shows that effectiveness of disease suppression following the easing of public health measures by countries is precarious;</p><p>&middot; The risk of imported cases due to the current ongoing increase in overseas travel.</p><p>A list of countries that are safer to travel to is under consideration by Government. Government agreed an approach to how the list would be determined broadly based on the epidemiology of the virus in that country. Further information will be available after Government has considered the matter [this evening].</p><p>The current advice is that anyone travelling to Ireland should restrict their movements for 14 days, on entering the country. This includes: Irish citizens coming home; people with no symptoms; and people who have tested negative for the virus in another country. This means staying at home and avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible. You should not use public transport, visit others, meet face-to-face with anyone who is at higher risk from coronavirus or go to the shop unless absolutely necessary (wearing a face covering if you do).</p><p>By law, anyone arriving in Ireland from any country will need to fill in a form called the COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. The Form will be used to facilitate a system of follow up checks to make sure people who travel to the country are staying where they said that they would. The Form will also ensure more accurate and expeditious contact tracing, should there be a suspected or confirmed case on a flight or ferry coming into Ireland.</p><p>Regarding restrictions on persons coming into the country, there are no proposals to implement a blanket ban on travel. We need to keep airports and travel routes open. Ireland depends on ports and airports for supply chains and connectivity bringing food, medicines and other products to Ireland which are critical to our health and for economic activity. Furthermore, some people need to travel for essential reasons. This includes: for essential work; to care for family members abroad; or to return home.</p><p>However, work is underway on a number of further travel related initiatives to reinforce public health measures, including: </p><p>&middot; There is to be an increased presence of staff at ports and airports to make incoming passengers aware of their obligations including restriction of movement for 14 days.</p><p>&middot; Work is under way to move the passenger locator form online</p><p>&middot; Sectoral Protocols and Procedures </p><p>Further measures remain under consideration.</p></reply>

Each Government Department has carefully considered how the impact of COVID-19 along with associated economic challenges have affected the sectors under their remits. As part of this, Departments will have engaged across a range of stakeholders especially sectoral representative organisations. The Departments have reflected on the inputs received, as well as their own analysis, and brought the conclusions of same for discussion centrally at the relevant Senior Officials Group.</p>  <p>  As I have said before, the Stimulus Package must be broad in reach to assist the variety of businesses most affected. I have also noted that the package is on a continuum of Government measures and represents the next step in how we stabilise the business impact. I have underlined that in developing the stimulus package, we must look ahead to ensuring economic recovery. The National Economic Plan, to be developed in parallel with the next budget, will be crucial in this respect. It will go beyond the issue of business supports and set out a range of actions to be developed across Government to realise economic recovery. All Government Departments will have a role in achieving this ambition. In developing contributions to the National Economic Plan, I would expect full engagement with stakeholders including worker representatives not only through fora such as the Labour Employer Economic Forum but bilaterally as well. Indeed, both I and my colleague Minister English have committed to meeting the unions to discuss a range of matters.</p></reply>

Any infectious disease pandemic is first and foremost a matter of public health for which a legal basis for reporting already exists under public health legislation. Notifiable infectious diseases are statutorily reportable under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 to the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health for investigation and control. </p>  <p>  At present, under occupational safety and health legislation, employers are required to report all workplace accidents that result in more than 3 days absence.  This requirement to report accidents does not apply to a person who suffers from a disease, occupational illness or any impairment of mental health in the workplace.</p>  <p>  There are some considerations to take into account in relation to introducing the mandatory reporting occupational diseases and/or illnesses to the Health and Safety Authority.  These include the fact that many employers would not in a position to assess or attribute the diagnosis of an illness such as COVID-19 with any degree of reliability, to a particular workplace, since COVID-19 can be acquired in either a community or a workplace setting. Furthermore, it would also introduce an obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer which could be seen as contrary to the protection of an individual&rsquo;s right to the privacy of such information.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that the Board of the Health and Safety Authority has requested a review of the reporting obligations concerning infectious diseases in the context of employer obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. The review will include consultation with a range of parties including the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency and will also examine if a proposed change can be achieved without increasing reporting requirements for employers outside the Health sector and can be aligned with GDPR requirements.  It will also look at the practices in other European Countries for the reporting of infectious diseases by employers.  The review should be complete in early September and I have asked that it also be submitted to my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

For example, I am mindful that other companies could include small suppliers who might go to the wall should debts owing to them remain unpaid.</p>  <p>  Under the Companies Act 2014, if a company wants to initiate a liquidation while insolvent, it cannot do so via a voluntary liquidation. Insolvency and the inability to pay debts are both defined concepts under the Companies Act 2014 - a company cannot merely assert that it is insolvent. It must apply to and be supervised by the High Court. This helps ensure that the system is not abused to the detriment of creditors including employees. Indeed, the Companies Act provides a range of safeguards to prevent abuse of the liquidation process and protect the interests of workers and other creditors of a company. </p>  <p>  Provisions already exist under the Act to reverse the impact of certain improper actions prior to insolvency. For example, section 608 provides for liquidators or creditors of an insolvent company in appropriate cases to obtain a court power to order the return of assets which have been improperly transferred. Section 599 concerns how a related company may be required to contribute to the payment of debts owed by the company being wound up. Such statutory provisions and the associated civil and criminal penalties also provide an important deterrent effect.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the liquidator of an insolvent company must report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) on the company&rsquo;s demise and must also apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the company, unless relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.</p>  <p>  Turning to the protection of employees, the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including official notification to the relevant Minister and a thirty day consultation period to allow employee representatives adequate opportunity to consider the employer&rsquo;s proposals and to make constructive proposals in response. While this legislation is currently the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it will shortly transfer to my Department as part of a wider transfer of functions Order.</p>  <p>  In relation to redundancy entitlements, it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees. However, the Social Insurance Fund, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides an important safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay statutory redundancy due to financial difficulties or insolvency. </p></reply>

The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that micro and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID19.</p><p>The Restart Grant is just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. The reason the scheme was linked to rate-paying businesses was that it was clear from the rate-payer databases within local authorities that this would make it possible to assist a very large number of small and micro-enterprises within a short period of time and with a minimum of bureaucracy. </p><p>We will be bringing forward an ambitious July Stimulus package in the coming days, which will include a range of measures to help SMEs across the range of sizes and sectors. </p><p>Currently, any business (Sole Trader, Partnership or Limited Company) with less than 10 full time employees and annual turnover of up to &euro;2m may apply to Microfinance Ireland for funding from &euro;5,000 &ndash; &euro;50,000 where the business is not in a position to avail of finance from Banks and other commercial lending providers. The loan incurs 0% interest for the first six months and Zero repayments.  Thereafter a reduced interest rate of 4.5% APR applies to loans applied for through the Local Enterprise Office. </p><p>All COVID19 Business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate, including adaptations to the phased opening of our economy. In that regard, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine how best to further assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 as part of the forthcoming Jobs Recovery Plan.  </p><p>Full details on all COVID19 measures for business are available at: .  </p></reply>

Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.</p>  <p>  The objective of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p>  <p>  My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was launched with an initial fund size of &euro;2m. Due to significant levels of interest for the Scheme from eligible retailers and the particular challenges facing the retail sector during the pandemic, the funding available was increased. On the 2 July 2020, I was pleased to announce that 183 retailers have been approved for &euro;6.5m in funding as part of the scheme. They will receive funding of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;40,000 and the average size of grants awarded under the first Call was &euro;35,500. The grant is calculated at a maximum of 80% of company expenditure of up to &euro;40,000 incurred by the successful applicants. The 183 retailers awarded funding operate across a broad spectrum of sectors and almost three quarters are located outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  A further call under the Scheme will be issued by Enterprise Ireland over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Further details on this Scheme are available at </p>  <p>  www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/funding-supports/online-retail/online-retail-scheme/online-retail-scheme.html.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there has also been a major expansion of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme to help small and micro enterprises, with no more than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector, to get online quickly.</p>  <p>  The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is being expanded by &euro;14.2m after the Local Enterprise Offices received 3 years&rsquo; worth of applications in 3 months following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland. Following a previous expansion of the Scheme in early April, total additional funding for the Scheme is now almost &euro;20m in 2020.</p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, small businesses can claim up to &euro;5,000 in two vouchers worth &euro;2,500 each. The Scheme also facilitates subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness and will continue to review supports in this particular area, working with the industry through the Retail Forum.  </p></reply>

In setting out its EMP, Ireland followed the objective of the Regulation to ensure that escapement of eels to the sea should be at 40% relative to &ldquo;pristine conditions&rdquo; (those pertaining in the early 1980s). </p>  <p>  The measures in the EMP include closure of the eel fishery and the internal market. In accordance with the EU Regulation, the plan and its measures have already been comprehensively reviewed in 2012, 2015 and 2018 when further public consultation was undertaken. All three reports are available on the website of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) www.fisheriesireland.ie. Further reviews will be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Taken cumulatively over the period 2009-2018, the reports indicate a relatively positive impact on stocks of both silver and yellow eels in the early part of the period but a continued decline by the time of the 2018 report. However, given the very long maturation period of each generation of eels in Irish waters, the impact of the very low annual recruitment of juvenile eels for more than 25 years means that recovery of the stock will only be sustained over the long term by commitment to consistent and equally long term management measures. The European eel is a panmithic stock - a single stock across the entire continent - which spawns in the Sargasso Sea before arriving into European rivers and lakes. Its distribution, including into Ireland, is naturally random. </p>  <p>  The species is on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (ICUN) red list of endangered species. The very latest advice is that anthropogenic mortality should be kept at zero or as close to zero as possible. In line with international scientific advice the fishery in Ireland remains closed and there is a prohibition in legislation on issuing licences. No harvest of eels permitted and I have no plans to change this position. </p></reply>

These schemes are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since 2000, approximately 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. Funding of approximately &euro;121 million has been allocated for home and community energy efficiency schemes and the solar PV scheme in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is open and applications can be made through SEAI. The budget allocation for 2020 is &euro;52.8 million - a record level of funding for this scheme.  Expenditure under this scheme is lower than the level projected at the start of the year due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions which meant that activity was paused for a number of weeks.  A total of &euro;10 million has been spent or is currently under audit and due to be paid, leaving a budget of &euro;43 million for the remainder of the year.  Of the remaining budget, works with a value of &euro;20.3 million have already been allocated to contractors. </p>  <p>  The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants covering approximately 30% of the works are provided towards the cost of a range of measures.  The scheme is open and applications can be made through SEAI. The 2020 budget for the Better Energy Homes Scheme is &euro;21 million. Between the period of January 2020 and June 2020, approximately &euro;9.3 million was spent leaving a remaining budget of &euro;11.7 million for the rest of the year.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Communities Scheme funds community-based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area.  It is applicable to homes, community facilities and businesses. The scheme closed to applications in January 2020 in line with Scheme Guidelines and will re-open to new applications for the 2021 scheme later this year. The budget for the Scheme this year was increased to &euro;22 million &ndash; with &euro;4 million of this allocation for a new &lsquo;homes only&rsquo; aggregation strand. The budget for this year&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities Scheme and homes only strand is fully allocated to projects.  In terms of actual expenditure, approximately &euro;3 million of the budget has been spent in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Further information on SEAI Grant Schemes can be found at: www.seai.ie/grants/.</p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and job creation and retention.  </p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery model capable of achieving these targets. This process has been informed by experience from existing schemes in Ireland such as the Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme referred to by the Deputy, consultation with stakeholders and an analysis of relevant international experience. The model is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and delivery structure. The Climate Action Plan, as part of this process, commits to reviewing and redesigning the existing grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government climate objectives and value for money.</p>  <p>  The Retrofit Taskforce report, to be published in Q3 2020, will inform the future design of retrofit schemes to deliver the ambitious targets as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Given the CRU&rsquo;s responsibilities and  statutory functions in respect of consumer protection, it has proactively taken several measures to protect domestic consumers in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, including putting in place the temporary moratorium on domestic electricity and gas disconnections on 16 March.  The CRU ended the moratorium on 29 June.  To assist customers who are concerned about paying their electricity or gas bill during this time, CRU has provided a suite of useful information on its website which can be accessed at www.cru.ie/home/about-cru/energy/difficulty-paying-your-bill-covid-19.  </p>  <p>  I have no role in these matters. Noting that the CRU moratorium is a matter for independent regulation, I have not discussed with relevant Ministers the impact of the CRU&rsquo;s temporary moratorium on utility disconnections on financially vulnerable customers, .</p>  <p>  The CRU is an independent statutory body solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions, including its consumer protection functions. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, to enable them raise questions on CRU matters directly with CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by families at this time.  Improving the energy efficiency of a home represents a significant opportunity for consumers to reduce their energy costs. Supports and funding are available via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), to assist residential homeowners, including those at risk of energy poverty. Approximately &euro;120 million has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency schemes in 2020. </p>  <p>  Social protection policies and income supports, including the Household Benefits Package and the fuel allowance, are matters for my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.   </p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  </p>  <p>  Evidently the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  I understand that the main Irish airlines have been offering the option to rebook in circumstances where a flight occurs but people are not able to present because of Government advice.  That said, I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances.  </p>  <p>  There has been considerable engagement with the airlines including around consumer rights issues.  Clearly, if the industry is seeking to secure State financial support to help it through the current period - which is one of the recommendations from the Aviation Taskforce - then a commitment to fairness and clarity on consumer rights will have to be offered in return, at the very least. </p></reply>

I intend to publish a report of the public consultation process shortly. </p><p>Unfortunately the targets in the Smarter Travel policy are not being achieved, reflecting the fact that some of the key actions in the policy have not been implemented. I intend, relying on this assessment and consultation, to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme.  The new policy statement will build on the policies and actions of Smarter Travel and set out additional polices and actions to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including active travel, and will replace the 2009 policy.  </p></reply>

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April 2020 with 6 new allocations approved.  None of these 6 allocations were to golf clubs. No other allocations have been made under the SCP this year. Details of previous years allocations under the SCP can be found at the following link:- www.gov.ie/en/collection/471ed5-sports-capital-allocations/.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that SCP funding is only available to organisations that are run on a not-for-profit basis and that are owned and run on behalf of the members. Any organisation allocated funding under the scheme must also be open for new members. </p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the appeals process, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP was undertaken. This Review is currently under consideration and includes recommendations for some changes to the terms and conditions of the next round of the SCP. I understand that this is expected to be finalised shortly and a decision on the timing of a new round of the SCP will be taken after that. </p></reply>

I understand that about 90% of the commercial bus operators suspended their services or have been providing significantly reduced services. My Department has engaged with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) on a regular basis in relation to the impact of Covid-19 on licensed bus operators.</p><p>From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial bus operators are now dealing with.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p><p>It is critical for the sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open. Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. </p><p>For that reason, I am pleased to advise the Deputies that on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.  </p><p>This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports for impacted businesses were introduced, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. ortly.</p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business</i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the<i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.</i></p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland's priorities within the tourism industry are for on-site practical training interventions to boost productivity and sustain employment.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group final report, F&aacute;ilte Ireland established a Tourism and Hospitality Oversight Group (COG) to co-ordinate the relevant bodies to agree and implement a work programme to address current and future labour supply and skill requirements in the Tourism and Hospitality sector.  Under the chairmanship of F&aacute;ilte Ireland members of this group have developed a two year work plan that focuses on delivery of five targeted objectives; improving awareness and attractiveness of the sector, building employment connections, best practice recruitment and retention, curriculum alignment and mapping existing provision to identify gaps. </p>  <p>  The Government will also shortly publish a series of immediate actions to support the economy - the "July Stimulus". In this context the Government will, among other things, consider further additional measures that may be needed to support the tourism and hospitality sector. </p>  <p>  My Department has liaised with other Government departments and industry representative bodies, to align the economy wide COVID-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs. The Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including tourism businesses as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p>  <p>  My predecessor also established the Tourism Recovery Taskforce on 20th May 2020 to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan.  This will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The Taskforce has submitted an initial report. </p></reply>

The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department is guided by NPHET and national experts.</p>  <p>  Inevitably, there is now a backlog of theory tests.

The Driver Theory Test provider is also closely monitoring the supply and demand situation at present.</p>  <p>  Those whose appointments were cancelled by the RSA due to the Covid-19 situation will have first priority.

It is not the role of the NPHET to provide guidance in relation to individual sectors, as a rule. </p>  <p>  A National Return to Work Safely Protocol has been produced under the aegis of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and is the result of a collaborative effort by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HSA has in turn produced COVID-19 checklists and templates, based on the Protocol, to help employers, business owners and managers to get their business up and running again and to inform workers about what they need to do to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.</p>  <p>  The RSA has developed protocols to ensure compliance with the overall protocols to enable the resumption of its services,, including driver testing.  In doing so, it was assisted by the overall national protocol and also by the additional templates and checklists from the HSA.  I understand that the National Office of Traffic Medicine was also available to the RSA to assist in its task.</p>  <p>  In anticipation of the resumption of driver testing on 29 June, the RSA wrote to each Approved Driving Instructor on 22 June, advising them of the planned phased return of driver testing.  The Authority included a series of Frequently Asked Questions, which provided details of the protocols being applied to driver testing in order to comply with health requirements in line with Government's Protocol on Returning to Work Safely.  These protocols may assist driving instructors in taking the necessary measures resuming their business safely.</p>  <p>  However, the RSA cannot dictate to driving schools on how they should run their business, or issue medical advice.  It is up to each driving instructor or driving school to protect themselves, their families and communities by adhering to the official Government guidelines on hygiene and social distancing.</p></reply>

Under the EU Package Travel Directive, travel agents and tour operators are required to provide their customers with a full cash refund when a holiday is cancelled due to exceptional circumstances, which of course Covid is.  However, the travel agents and tour operators are having difficulties securing refunds themselves from their suppliers to pass onto their customers, and indeed where flights take place - irrespective whether a travel agent's customer has cancelled - the airlines are not obligated to provide a refund.  I know this is causing considerable financial strain in the sector.</p>  <p>  The State is providing financial backing for a Refund Credit Note scheme, under which travel agents and tour operators can issue credit notes to their customers instead of cash - if the customer agrees - and the financial value of that credit note is guaranteed by the State.  This is a measure designed to give assurance to consumers about the safety of accepting a credit note, and help the industry alleviate the cash flow drain it is experiencing.  The challenge is to ensure that consumer rights are protected and at the same time that viable business and their workers are kept going. Further, the sector may avail of the Government wage support scheme and business supports particularly those aimed at small and medium enterprises. My Department is maintaining an open engagement with the travel trade industry and Minister Naughton is due to meet with representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association to discuss ongoing issues.</p></reply>

It was the intention to have this law in place earlier in the year, unfortunately due to emergency legislation required as a result of Covid-19 it was not possible.

Its function is to investigate marine casualties and publish reports of such investigations involving Irish registered vessels worldwide, and other vessels in Irish territorial waters and inland waterways. </p><p>Section 8 of the 2000 Act provides that the MCIB shall be independent of the Minister for Transport in the performance of its functions and, in general, shall be independent of any other person or body whose interests could conflict with its functions.</p><p>Section 9 of the 2000 Act sets out the composition of the five person Board, which consists of three persons appointed by the Minister for Transport; the Chief Surveyor of the Department of Transport; and the Secretary General of the Department or his or her nominee.  Under current arrangements, the three Ministerial appointments are made following an open application process involving the Public Appointments Service State Boards recruitment system.  MCIB investigations are carried out by its panel of external investigators.</p><p>European Directive 2009/18/EC of 23 April 2009 established the fundamental principles governing the investigation of certain accidents in the maritime transport sector (with Member States having until 17 June 2011 to bring in the required legislation).  The remit of the Directive is narrower than that of the MCIB as it excludes certain vessels from its application (such as fishing vessels of less than fifteen metres length; pleasure craft; and inland waterway vessels).  Article 8.1 of the Directive provides <i>inter alia </i>that the investigative body shall be independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it.</p><p>In 2011, the MCIB was designated as the investigative body in the State for the purposes of the Directive by Regulation 4 of the European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 276 of 2011).</p><p>The European Commission expressed concern about the composition of the Board of the MCIB in the context of the independence requirements of Article 8.1, with particular regard to the membership of the Chief Surveyor of the Department of Transport and the nominee of the Secretary General of the Department.  The case was lodged with the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in March 2019.</p><p>On 9 July 2020 the CJEU delivered its judgment, declaring that by failing to provide for an investigating body which is independent in its organisation and decision making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to that investigative body, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 8.1 of Directive 2009/18/EC.</p><p>It is important to note that there was no finding of partiality on the part of the MCB but the CJEU has noted that a finding that the investigative body failed to act impartially in specific cases is not necessary to establish an infringement.</p><p>My Department is examining the judgment and is awaiting legal advice on possible next steps, including amending legislation.  Any such proposals will provide a basis for early engagement with the European Commission in order to ensure that the Court findings and the concerns of the Commission are addressed.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to progress matters and to address the Court findings and the concerns of the European Commission as quickly as possible. </p><p>It is not my intention to seek any form of inquiry into the MCIB&rsquo;s investigations, noted above, no finding of partiality has been made in the actions of the Board of the MCIB.</p><p>In relation to the Merchant Shipping (Marine Casualty Investigation Board) (Amendment) Bill 2019 &ndash; as you will know the Bill fell along with all such others due to the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il.  I expect that the actions taken to address the findings of the CJEU&rsquo;s ruling will negate the need for the re-introduction of any similar Bill.</p></reply>

The Exchequer allocates funding for the purposes of both capital and current expenditure from the Department's Vote to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for allocation to the transport operators for the provision of public transport services and infrastructure.  In Budget 2020, an overall allocation of &euro;1 billion was secured to fund public and sustainable transport projects this year.</p><p>Since 2010, the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding falls under the independent statutory remit of the NTA.  The allocations to the companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.</p><p>The sharp decline in passenger numbers since mid-March this year as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency has caused an unprecedented fall in fare revenues, thus creating a wide gap between the operators' costs and actual revenues. This has put acute pressure on the existing Public Service Obligation (PSO) budget.  In response to this situation, and in recognition of the role of public transport as an essential service and in facilitating the Government's <i>Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business</i>, on 4 June the Government decided to make a substantial increase to the 2020 total PSO allocation, in order to enable the continuation of PSO services for the full year.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that on 25 June the Government agreed to a temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p><p>These measures are, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports introduced for impacted businesses, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, restart grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example.</p><p>In view of the above and the NTA's role in allocating transport funding to individual transport operators, I have referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply.  I ask him to inform my private office if he does not receive a reply within ten days.</p></reply>

As re-opening continues, more people need to travel on public transport. S.I. No. 244 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020) was introduced on Friday 10 July and came into effect on Monday 13 July. The new Regulations require passengers, with some exceptions, to wear face coverings.  This gives additional protection to both passengers and transport staff.</p><p>Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces, but that they not suitable for every individual.  Recognising this, the new Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13.  Reflecting public health advice, the Regulations also allow that wearing a face covering is not required where a person has a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;, and this includes where a person -</p><p>- cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress,</p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating,</p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or</p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication.</p><p>The NTA is engaging with public transport operators regarding implementation of the Regulations.  The NTA is also making arrangements for an easy and discreet way for vulnerable people who have a reasonable excuse for not wearing a face covering to communicate this with relevant public transport staff.</p><p>The Regulations are implementable by a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; who is defined as any officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the NTA.  A relevant person implementing the Regulations can seek the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where needed.</p><p>Where a passenger is not wearing a face covering, a relevant person under the Regulations may:</p><p>- request the passenger to wear a face covering,</p><p>- refuse the passenger entry to the public transport vehicle, or</p><p>- request the passenger to alight from the vehicle.</p><p>Failure to comply is an offence and there are penalties (on summary conviction) for non-compliance.</p><p>Operators are already reporting high levels of compliance by passengers.  I expect this to grow in the coming days as people understand the importance of protecting their fellow passengers and the staff of the public transport operators.  It is not intended that enforcement or penalties will be needed often, but they are now available if necessary.</p><p>The Chief Medical Officer and the HSE are responsible for the issuing of guidelines in relation to public health and the public health advices apply across all modes of public transport.  Guidance on the wearing of face coverings, including on public transport, is available on the HSE website.  The NTA is working with public transport operators (both public and private) who are implementing public health advice in relation to issues such as cleaning regimes and social distancing measures designed to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19.</p><p>In addition, The 'Return to Work Safely Protocol' which was published on 9 May 2020 sets out the steps and processes employers and workers must take to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  The Protocol is a living document which will evolve with changing Public Health advice.</p></reply>

However, extending the validity of driver licences for a further period is under consideration.</p>  <p>  The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) resumed services on Monday 8 June 2020. The service resumed on a gradual basis, and by Monday 29 June all NDLS centres, except Clifden and Belmullet, had reopened.</p>  <p>  NDLS offices are unable to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers, and therefore all appointments must be booked in advance. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is working with their providers to see how they can increase capacity while adhering to the return to work safely protocol. Options include extended opening hours, overtime and protective segregation barriers between booths. Some applicants may be able to apply online.

Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, payments under the TWSS and the PUP are subject to income tax. Payments under the TWSS are also subject to universal social charge (USC), while the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, is exempt from that charge.  Payments under both schemes are exempt from PRSI charges.</p>  <p>  Neither PUP nor TWSS payments are taxed in real-time through the PAYE system, but a recipient of either payment may become liable for income tax and USC (for TWSS only) at the end of the year, which will be calculated by Revenue through the end of year review process.</p>  <p>  In cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of tax and USC due by the person may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him or her at the end of the year. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of TWSS payments or the PUP on what is known as the &ldquo;week 1 basis&rdquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that may arise at end year.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the final calculation of the end of year tax liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including the person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise at end year following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period.  This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

It provides<i></i>that a qualifying first time buyer must take out a loan in an amount equal to at least 70% of either the purchase price of the property in the case of a purchased house or the value of the property in the case of a self-build house. The valuation of a self-build is as approved by the lender as determined in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro prudential rules.  These rules stipulate the valuation as being the site cost plus the cost of construction.</p><p>My Department's tax expenditure guidelines require that tax incentives must seek to avoid deadweight.

This requirement is set down in Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.</p>  <p>  The scheme was developed in a short period of time, having regard to the overarching urgent Government objective of getting assistance to employers and employees quickly.</p>  <p>  Since it was introduced, over 50,000 firms have availed of the scheme (which is almost a third of all employers from 2019). Over 500,000 jobs have been directly supported over the period and many more indirectly.  This is considerable coverage and it is noted that the value of payments made to date is over &euro;2 billion.</p>  <p>  The question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS. The scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p>  <p>  As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy and enterprises is evolving. Having regard to the novel circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, in July it was announced that the TWSS will remain until the end of August. Work has been ongoing and is at an advanced stage around how best to support employers into the more medium term. The position of various sectors, including the businesses and workers mentioned by the Deputies, will be taken into account in this process.  As per the commitment in the Programme for Government, it is planned that the July Jobs Initiative will set out a pathway for the future of the TWSS.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. The &ldquo;use of sporting facilities&rdquo; is specifically listed in Annex III which therefore allows Ireland to apply the second reduced rate, currently 9%.</p>  <p>  Services consisting of the care of the human body supplied in the course of a health studio business or similar business, such as a yoga studio, are not listed in Annex III and therefore would in general be subject to the standard rate. However, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to the services of yoga studios.  This is known as a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo; and the continuation of this reduced rate application is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%. Therefore, there is no discretion under the Directive to apply the 9% rate to these services.</p></reply>

In line with this, my Department also produces investment projections by asset class rather than by sector. Nonetheless, the nominal value for total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) or total investment in 2019 suggest was &euro;162 billion.</p>  <p>  However, &lsquo;headline&rsquo; investment figures are heavily influenced by the activities of a small number of large multinational firms which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy. These activities include the on-shoring of intellectual property assets to Ireland and investment in aircraft by the leasing sector. Modified investment &ndash; which removes these distortions &ndash; is estimated to have been &euro;44 billion in 2019. Public investment in 2019 is estimated to have been just over &euro;8 billion. The difference of &euro;36 billion represents a reasonable approximation of private sector investment excluding globalisation related distortions.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Stability Programme update 2020, which incorporates the impacts of Covid-19, modified investment is expected to be severely impacted by the pandemic. It is projected to fall sharply this year and is not projected to return to its 2019 level until at least 2022. In direct response to Covid-19, there has been a significant increase in public capital investment primarily in health and business supports, bringing total projected public investment this year to just under &euro;9 billion. Capital investment will also form part of the July Stimulus.</p>  <p>  As well as committing to bringing forward the review of the National Development Plan from 2022, the Programme for Government makes a range of commitments directly related to public investment, notably in the areas of climate action and biodiversity; town-centric planning and compact growth; reorientation of transport investment in support of sustainable modal shift; retrofitting; and advancement of Project Ireland 2040 goals in relation to balanced regional development. The review will include an overview of the macro-economic context and justification for the planned level of expenditure taking into account demand and supply-side constraints, trends and developments in the construction sector before and during the Covid-19 period, as well as international comparisons.</p></reply>

The Government will continue to prioritise reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public liability, and employer liability insurance.  This is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance; increasing transparency; examining legal reforms in the duty of care area; enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and increasing competition.  This cross-departmental approach to addressing the challenges many have faced with insurance builds and expands upon previous work carried out by the Cost of Insurance Working group.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing premiums in some sectors, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October.  The guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of such awards by the courts.</p>  <p>  However, it is also important to recognise that there is no single policy or legislative to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  There are also many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address it, in particular the fact that it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied, or direct insurance companies as to their pricing levels.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government.  This is an issue I, as Minister for Finance, along with my Departmental colleague, Minister of State Fleming, will focus on.  In doing so we will be cooperating with our Ministerial colleagues that will be participating in the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment in terms of prioritising the commitments on insurance reform.</p></reply>

The most recent of these, and of particular note, is the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Behind the Data&rsquo; note on Covid-19 Payment Breaks &ndash; who has needed them?  This publication may be found at .</p><p>The note outlines the distribution of payment breaks across different categories of borrowers, specifically households, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporates. High-level data are provided, aggregating across financial services firms; supplemented with additional detail for Irish retail banks&rsquo; business borrowers (i.e., SME and corporate borrowers). There is additional context to the data published in the Central Bank&rsquo;s recent Financial Stability Review.</p><p>As at late June, there were nearly 30,500 payment breaks approved for Irish business borrowers.  Some 27,200 are SMEs with breaks in respect of loans worth &euro;6 billion, which represents about 28% of the Irish SME loan book.  The other 3,200 payment business payments break are for corporate customers.  They are in respect of &euro;2.1 billion of loans representing 17% of the corporate loan book.  Irish retail banks account for the overwhelming number and value of these payment breaks.</p><p>In terms of aiding businesses to survive and successfully reopen, I have introduced a series of measures and supports including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the proposed &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of certain COVID-19 related tax debts which are two significant measures introduced to support businesses immediate cash flow challenges.</p><p>In addition, Government announced a package of measures aimed at supporting businesses and farmers including the provision of grants and loans, in relation to working capital, longer-term finance and business advisory supports. A comprehensive list of these measures can be found at .  Government is also providing a range of loan guarantee schemes to enhance access to credit, particularly for SMEs.  Indeed, my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is bringing the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020 before the Oireachtas this week to provide for the &euro;2 billion Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme.  It provides for 80% guarantees on loans between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1m with a maximum term of 6 years.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Government has announced an Economic Stimulus package today that includes a further mix of supports having consulted with the business community.</p></reply>

From this analysis, over 88% of employees have received wage payments from employers in addition to the TWSS subsidy, with 45% of weekly paid employees receiving between &euro;1 and &euro;100 and a further 32% receiving between &euro;101 and &euro;200. Further details of those receiving additional payments are set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Additional Pay Amount</th>       <th>Share of Employees</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;1-&euro;100</td>       <td>44.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;101-&euro;200</td>       <td>31.8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;201-&euro;300</td>       <td>11.2%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;300+</td>       <td>12.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>All Additional Pay Amount</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS. The scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is provided for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting financial assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions that were introduced as a result of the Public Health emergency.</p><p>The TWSS is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.  There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to part-time or work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>As I advised during the D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the bill, &quot;<i>it could be very possible that there will be even more companies in the future that will have a very low level of income coming in because demand for their goods or service has evaporated which means they are not in a position to add to the subsidy...&quot;</i>and that requiring employers to add to the 70% floor on wages <i>&quot;...could undermine the ability of the scheme to operate.&quot;</i></p><p>However, the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS.  At the same time, there is no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.  There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p><p>Finally, I would add that details of subsidy payments made by pay date are available to view in each employee&rsquo;s myAccount record on Revenue&rsquo;s online system.  This facility allows employees to see whether their employer is participating in the scheme and being refunded a wage subsidy on their behalf.  Where the amount of subsidy paid is available from the relevant employer payroll submissions made to Revenue, that amount is also displayed.</p></reply>

The scheme has to date supported almost 63,000 employers in maintaining the employment of some 618,000 employees at a cost over &euro;2 billion.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the ongoing programme of compliance checks by Revenue to ensure that only employers who meet the qualifying conditions, as set out in Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, are availing of the scheme and that the income supports are being properly paid to employees.  Revenue has confirmed that the compliance checks, which are not part of its programme of audits and other tax compliance interventions are being carried out on a phased basis over the next few months. To date, compliance letters have issued to approximately 12% of employers availing of the scheme and many of these have already provided a prompt and satisfactory response to Revenue&rsquo;s information requests. A small number of cases have been escalated to a more detailed examination and these enquiries are ongoing.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that it is too early in the programme of checks to draw conclusions, but to date the enquiries have not indicated any widespread abuse of the scheme.</p></reply>

The payment breaks on mortgages allow households to absorb the shock of the crisis, so that as many as possible can recover once the virus is under control.</p>  <p>  As at the end of June, the Central Bank reported that of the almost 160,000 payment breaks approved for Irish borrowers, just over 70,000 were for mortgage holders in respect of loans worth c.&euro;9.6 billion.  Mortgages on primary dwelling houses accounted for nearly 62,500 of these.</p>  <p>  However, these measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.  As the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I made clear to the CEOs of the main retail banks in meetings last week, it will not be acceptable for banks to make excess profits from borrowers on payment breaks and it will be a matter for banks to demonstrate that this situation will not arise.</p>  <p>  The banks assured us that work is ongoing at the highest levels to ensure a smooth return to regular repayments for their customers who are currently on COVID-19 payment breaks. Customers who have difficulties returning to regular repayment at the end of the payment break will be supported with a range of options so that a manageable repayment can be agreed.</p>  <p>  The Government and the Central Bank of Ireland have stated that it is essential that lenders fully explain the implications, including any associated cost or other significant impacts, of the particular payment break measures being put in place.  For instance, lenders should outline if the repayment term of the mortgage will be extended due to the payment break, if monthly payments will increase following the resumption of the mortgage repayments, if interest will continue to accrue during the payment break and the implications this will have for the total cost of the credit, and any other significant matter for the customer when availing of a Covid-19 payment break, or indeed for any other reason.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has required that regulated firms have plans and the operational capability to deliver an assessment of all borrowers on payment breaks to ensure that appropriate and sustainable solutions are identified in a timely manner for those borrowers who are not able to return to paying full capital and interest at the expiry of the payment break.</p></reply>

The ambition of the scheme is to ensure the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed.</p>  <p>  The TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible employees on their payroll, including rehired staff who were temporarily laid off.  Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria, which can be at any point in time during the scheme&rsquo;s duration.</p>  <p>  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay of the employee as reported to Revenue for January and February 2020. With regard to the subsidy amount, there is no distinction made between businesses who closed due to the restrictions and businesses who continued to trade, with employees continuing to work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The TWSS has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship insofar as terms, conditions, entitlements and rights of the employment are concerned.  Consequently, the operation and management of redundancy is a matter between the employer and employee concerned and is outside the remit of the present scheme.</p></reply>

The GCEU rejected all three lines of arguments put forward by the Commission. Thus, it overturned the Commission&rsquo;s 2016 Decision that Ireland had granted a State aid to Apple.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always been clear that, based on Irish law, the correct amount of Irish tax was charged to the company and that Ireland did not provide State aid to Apple. This was the reason that Ireland appealed the Commission Decision and the judgment from the GCEU vindicates Ireland&rsquo;s stance to appeal the Commission Decision.</p>  <p>  The State and its lawyers are now examining the detail of the judgment.</p>  <p>  As both the State and Apple have been successful in having the judgement annulled, an appeal by either the State or Apple is not possible and therefore the issue does not arise.</p>  <p>  An appeal is open to the Commission at this stage.

Submissions related to tax may also be reviewed by officials in the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) was amended by Council Directive 2009/47/EC of 5 May 2009, allowing for Member States to provide for a reduced rate of VAT to alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks when supplied as part of a restaurant or catering service.</p>  <p>  The supply of alcohol and other drinks in a premise with an &lsquo;on&rsquo; licence could be defined as constituting the supply of a restaurant or catering service where served in conjunction with a meal, in which case some supplies would attract the reduced rate, while others were liable at the standard rate. Defining and enforcing a workable distinction would be extremely difficult and there would be considerable risk of abuse and unfair competition.</p>  <p>  If the supply of all drinks in an &lsquo;on&rsquo; premises was defined as the supply of a restaurant or catering service this would bring sales of alcohol in nightclubs and the like within the scope of the reduced rate, which would be contrary to our general public health policy on alcohol pricing and consumption and contrary to current public policy objectives on social distancing during the pandemic. If such a measure were implemented it would also give rise to different rates being applied to &lsquo;on licence&rsquo; and &lsquo;off licence&rsquo; sales by traders engaged in both; this would give rise to considerable scope for abuse and unfair competition on the part of non-compliant traders.</p></reply>

In accordance with its terms of reference, the review focused on the impact of house price movements on LPT liabilities under a series of scenarios involving different rate and tax band structures. The review also included an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. It included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p><p>The Programme for Government &quot;Our Shared Future&quot; adopted by the Government on 27 June 2020 includes a commitment to bring forward legislation in relation to the Local Property Tax (LPT) on the basis of fairness and that most homeowners will face no increase in their LPT liability. In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which are currently exempt from the LPT, into the taxation system. Further, all LPT funds collected locally will be retained within the local authority concerned. This is to be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer.</p><p>My Department is examining options for the implementation of these commitments in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and relevant Departments.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-21a.547.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100078#WRL02000"><p>The serious threat that illicit trade in tobacco, alcohol and fuel products poses to legitimate business, to consumers and the Exchequer is clear and I am assured that combatting such criminality continues to be a Revenue priority.  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-Border fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work in this area has achieved a considerable level of success. For my part, I will fully consider any additional proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas. However, I would not support proposals such as those contained in the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill previously sponsored by the former Deputy Declan Breathnach. That Bill proposed to make it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel, to make it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer and to impose penalties and on-the-spot fines in respect of such offences. These proposals were not just unworkable but would undermine the good work that is ongoing in this area by diverting resources from where they are most required.</p>  <p>  The Retailers Against Smuggling (RAS) group, which has written to the Deputy, has highlighted concerns about the impact of smuggled solid fuel on legitimate retailers in Ireland, particularly in the border regions. All solid fuel supplied in the State is liable to Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT). Currently, there is no carbon tax on solid fuel in Northern Ireland.  This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel, lower environmental standards and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials which incentivises the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  EU Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of harmonised excises on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol. Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, Revenue has no authority to challenge transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland as such transportation or possession are not, in themselves, Revenue offences. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could legitimately claim that SFCT will be accounted for on relevant supplies made in the State. An SFCT return does not have to be made until one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.  Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT.  Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The collection of SFCT by Revenue is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regime is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards. It should be noted that SFCT legislation does not distinguish between &ldquo;smokeless&rdquo; and &ldquo;smoky&rdquo; coal and the same SFCT rate applies regardless of the fuel standard. Distinctions between smokeless and smoky coal are made in the regulatory regime for environmental standards of solid fuel. I understand that this regime includes a ban on the burning of smoky coal and other prohibited fuels in certain areas (Low Smoke Zones). This ban complements the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of those fuels in those areas and means that even smoky fuels bought elsewhere cannot be burned in Low Smoke Zones.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment contacted Revenue with a view to putting in place more formal and enhanced cooperation between local authorities and Revenue in carrying out their respective roles of enforcing solid fuel environmental regulations and administering SFCT.  At the beginning of 2020 Revenue participated in a number of &ldquo;joint operations&rdquo; within Low Smoke Zones in conjunction with the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and local authority solid fuel inspection teams, with a view to checking for compliance across several tax headings, including SFCT. Revenue participated in these operations, based on the clear understanding of the statutory responsibilities of the agencies involved.  In addition, a SFCT compliance module has been included in Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing  Mineral Oil Tax national compliance project. This project, along with many other field-based compliance activities, has been impacted by Covid-19 restrictions since mid-March.</p></reply>

Similarly, national rules governing public procurement must comply with relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. These rules aim to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. These rules underpinning procurement have not changed due to Brexit or Covid-19, as the Procurement Directives provide for a range of options for procuring goods and services during a crisis and international procurement.</p><p>My Department has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland and the Office of Government Procurement developed a comprehensive policy framework incorporating guidance and training. The purpose of this is to enable procurers to carry out procurement processes in a consistent manner. Suppliers benefit from this unified approach as it enables them to prepare for all procurement opportunities in a similar fashion.  It also improves the probity around purchasing which protects the State by ensuring that it pays the appropriate amount for works, goods and services in a fair and open manner. I am satisfied that the rules governing public procurement do not inhibit the State in tackling the issues you have raised.</p><p>In relation to Covid-19, the OGP is supporting the national response through the governance structure established by Government ensuring a public health-led, whole-of-government approach, including the Special Cabinet Committee and Senior Officials Group.  The OGP works closely with the HSE and the wider Government sector to assist them in identifying the most pressing needs including Personal Protective Equipment and other essential services in a challenging global market.</p><p>The OGP <i>Information Note on Covid-19 (Coronavirus) and Public Procurement</i>provides information on procurement options available to contracting authorities in cases of unforeseeable events. It identifies relevant legislation and payment procedures and gives advice on commencing new procurement procedures and managing current contracts. Guidance to contracting authorities managing public works projects was also published providing greater certainty in the context of the closure of many construction sites and managing the implications of the Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p><p>The OGP <i>Information Note on Brexit and Public Procurement</i>identifies potential risks faced by public bodies including disruption to supply, increased costs, extra administrative burdens and regulatory change. The OGP wrote to all Government Departments advising them to identify and manage potential risks to supply and to put in place the necessary contingency plans. Such contingencies may include, inter alia, bulk buying and holding stock, and sourcing substitutions and alternative suppliers.</p><p>The OGP has assessed its framework agreements and engaged with key suppliers in anticipation of Brexit. The key risks identified are potential increased costs, interruption to supply and a changed regulatory environment.  Many of the issues that may emerge in procurement are likely to relate to trade issues such as tariffs, logistics, customs, and regulatory divergence. The procurement rules have been developed in tandem with the WTO rules on procurement and are therefore flexible in a global context.</p></reply>

The draft review document was on display at the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre for ten weeks in 2019 and members of the public and stakeholders were invited to submit their observations on the document to OPW.</p>  <p>  This draft document did not constitute a planning document nor was the consultation a statutory consultation process. While the document explored options for sustainable transport and long-term transport development ideas, it should be noted that it did not include specific actions or solutions to current traffic management, transport or mobility challenges in the Phoenix Park. Rather it included a key recommendation that OPW should commission a Transport and Mobility Study for the Park. In December 2019, OPW committed to undertake such a study. Work was due to commence on this study in April 2020.  However, due to the COVID-19 restrictions, the OPW was unable to proceed as planned.</p>  <p>  The decision to reopen the Phoenix Park peripheral gates on Friday 10th July was based on an increase in the volume of traffic in the neighbouring areas surrounding the Park to which the gate closures have in part contributed. A further increase in traffic volume in the coming weeks and months with the return of workers to the City and the reopening of schools might also be anticipated.</p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to engaging in a consultation process around a new Transport and Mobility strategy for the Park. This consultation will involve all stakeholders to ensure we develop a balanced approach to access to the Park, for all users. This process is now expected to take place during August/September of this year and will ultimately inform the appropriate sustainable solutions to traffic management in the Phoenix Park in the short, medium and long term.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal Confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.</p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER.  I am advised that the current position on the Confirmation process is that a request for tender of services for environmental consultants is currently being progressed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).</p>  <p>  The public consultation phase is also due to be commenced by DPER shortly.  DPER will progress the formal Confirmation process, having due regard to the detailed requirements of the 2019 regulations.</p>  <p>  It is not possible at this point in the process to give specific dates for commencement of works given that there is always a possibility that further information and/or revision of the scheme&rsquo;s design may be required, as provided for under the Confirmation process. It should be noted that DPER is also progressing Confirmation of two other significant flood defence schemes for the Glashaboy and Bride Rivers in Co.

The intention of these reforms is to increase transparency around the budgetary process and to facilitate meaningful dialogue around key elements of the Budget and on what is being achieved with public funds.</p><p>Central to these reforms is the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework. This refers to an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities throughout the year, rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day. An important element of this is the publication of a range of documents at key points in the year to enhance engagement on relevant budgetary issues.  </p><p>Improving and supporting the evaluation capacity within Government Departments has also formed an important part of the reform programme. Supported by the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, this has led to the development of a number of additional processes and reports to support the budgetary framework. This includes:</p><p><b>- Performance Budgeting - </b>A key objective of the Performance Budgeting Initiative is to shift the focus away from the quantum of spend and towards outputs and impacts. The Public Service Performance Report presents performance information in an accessible manner and aims to facilitate discussion around what is being delivered with public funds and how this impacts the citizen. </p><p><b>- Equality Budgeting &ndash; </b>Equality budgeting involves providing greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and/or ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of  equality concerns into the budgetary process. An OECD &quot;Policy Scan&quot; Report on Equality Budgeting was completed in 2019, and was published on Budget Day in October last, setting out a number of ambitious objectives to progress this aspect of the budgetary reform agenda.<b></b></p><p><b>- Spending Review</b>-  This process  aims to place evidence at the heart of policy making, by systematically examining existing spending programmes with a view to assessing their efficiency and effectiveness. This approach can  support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.  In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.</p></reply>

Over the last number of months, significant additional expenditure has been allocated to a number of Departments in response to Covid-19. While we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation with regards to this virus, all of the usual measures remain in place in relation to the sanctioning and management of expenditure. </p>  <p>  The overall allocation set out for 2020 in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2020, published in December 2019, was &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure. Including the additional expenditure agreed by the D&aacute;il in relation to Covid-19 measures, the revised Government Expenditure Ceiling now amounts to &euro;79.7 billion. This reflects an additional &euro;6.8 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, nearly &euro;2 billion for the Department of Health and &euro;483 million for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  Further measures have also been announced by Government in response to the Covid-19 crisis, notably the decision to extend the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to August. Taking into account the estimated cost of these decisions made to end-June, the overall expenditure increase compared with the figures set out in REV 2020 is almost &euro;12 billion. This does not reflect supports to be announced as part of the July Stimulus plan.</p>  <p>  Arising from Government formation, a number of reconfigurations of Government Departments are underway. On completion of these transfers of functions and related allocations, restated Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il reflecting the new Departmental structures and allocations. These Estimates will reflect decisions in relation to additional funding to respond to Covid-19, including that set out in the July stimulus. Over the coming months, it will be important that Departments manage within the allocations set out in these Estimates.</p>  <p>  Coordinated action at EU level, including ECB support in the bond markets and the activation of the General Escape Clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, has been important in addressing the Covid-19 crisis. This has supported the Government's approach towards the Covid-19 crisis, with substantial additional resources being allocated that are being funded by borrowings as the General Government Balance moves from surplus in 2019 to a significant deficit this year. </p>  <p>  As regards the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council: in its Fiscal Advisory Report, published in June, the Council assessed the Government&rsquo;s swift response to the pandemic as appropriate. The Council also recommended a temporary and targeted fiscal stimulus during the recovery phase. The overarching measures already introduced have provided support across a broad range of sectors impacted by Covid-19. As our economy and society reopens, recovery is underway. However, it is clear that it is weak in many sectors and that there is a clear role for further measures to support economic activity and employment. The July stimulus, which is in the process of being agreed by Government, will provide additional targeted supports to stimulate activity across the economy, provide assistance to firms and support employment in the short- and medium-term. </p>  <p>  Taking a longer-term view, a National Economic Plan will be published in conjunction with Budget 2021, setting out our long-term approach to restoring employment and outlining how we will secure our public finances. As the economy returns to growth and employment is restored, it is important that the deficit is reduced year-on-year to underpin the sustainability of the public finances. To achieve this aim, a sustainable Medium-Term Expenditure framework will be pursued that provides a clear pathway back to a balanced budget. Throughout this process, Government will prioritise policy actions that protect the most vulnerable and put in place new measures for economic decision making that reflect the welfare and quality of life of those living in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A sustainable Medium-Term expenditure framework, means ensuring that we are achieving the greatest possible impact with public expenditure and delivering high quality public services in an efficient and effective manner. A range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. My Department is also now managing the first year of a new cycle of the Spending Review process, which is another key tool in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in public expenditure and which can support the reallocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities where necessary. As set out in the Programme for Government, we are committed to continuing that programme of reform.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that a number of open competitions have already taken place or are in the process of taking place for recruitment to the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Public Appointments Service, who are the independent recruiter for the Civil Service, that since the lifting of the moratorium, approximately 15,880 civil servants from open competitions excluding temporary assignments and professional and technical posts, have been assigned to Government departments and offices across general service grades. This figure would, of course be offset by retirements and other people leaving the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  An open CO competition was advertised recently and an open AP competition was also advertised recently. An open competition for posts at EO level countrywide will be advertised shortly.  </p>  <p>  Apart from competitions already advertised, it is too early to say at this stage what competitions will be held for all of 2020.

Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70. Prior to 26 December 2018, most of these public servants had a compulsory retirement age of 65.</p>  <p>  The definition of relevant public servant includes the vast majority of pre-1 April 2004 public servants.

It is very sensitive to water quality and to land use management that may impact on the rivers in which it lives, including the Munster Blackwater. </p><p>In 2019, the national conservation status for Freshwater Pearl Mussel was assessed as being &ldquo;Bad and declining&rdquo; in Ireland&rsquo;s report on the status of habitats and species listed in the EU Habitats Directive. (A summary of the report is available on the NPWS website at ).</p><p>The Munster Blackwater  is a deep, dark and fast-flowing river, and is difficult to survey for these reasons. Data on the status of the Mussel in the Blackwater, including its current distribution and abundance, is incomplete. However some recent surveys of parts of the river found more mussels than were previously known in the main channel of the river.</p><p>In 2011, the National Parks and Wildlife Service drafted the &ldquo;Strategy for Conservation of the Freshwater Pearl Mussel in Ireland&rdquo;. This Strategy proposed a particular focus of conservation efforts on the 8 best pearl mussel rivers in the country, and at the time set out that it would not be possible to restore some of the 27 populations in SACs, including the Munster Blackwater main channel, because of the low number and poor condition of the remaining mussels, the bad status of the mussel habitat and the magnitude of the pressures in the catchment. With this in mind, the European Union Environmental Objectives (Pearl Mussels) Regulations 2018 amended S.I. 296 of 2009  in order to enable the removal of the pearl mussel as a qualifying interest for the main channel of the Munster Blackwater River.</p><p>It was intended that the Conservation Objectives for the SAC would be altered so that the mussel would remain a qualifying interest in certain tributaries, but would no longer be so in the main channel of the river.</p><p>However, in December 2018, a judicial review was brought before the High Court, challenging the making of the 2018 Regulations. In light of recent jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the application of the  legal requirements of the SEA Directive, my Department considered  it would be prudent to agree to an Order of Certiorari to have the making of the 2018 Regulations quashed. Accordingly, the mussel remains as a qualifying interest for the SAC.</p><p>My Department is currently reviewing the case and all of the evidence presented by affidavit. While the Department&rsquo;s decision was made on foot of procedural matters, it was also clear that the scientific evidence on which the 2011 strategy was based has changed in light of further knowledge; and it is clear that no change to the regulations would be possible without extensive survey work in the river, a substantial and difficult task as outlined above. The necessary survey work would be likely to require 2 years to complete, given reasonable weather and river conditions.</p></reply>

On 16 June a significant investment of &euro;25 million in Arts and Culture in 2020 was announced. This new investment is in addition to and builds on previous funding allocated to the sector. This funding will address immediate priorities to assist with the unique challenges faced by the arts as our society and economy reopens.  Artists, arts organisations and culture workers will be supported to continue to create art and innovate.  Of this, &euro;20 million has been directed to Arts Council bringing its 2020 allocation to &euro;100 million.  A further &euro;5 million is being made available for other measures including securing the future of key cultural and museum spaces and facilities throughout the country and the production of high-quality digital art and on-line performances as well. </p><p>Among the measures being introduced will be new bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis.  The Department is providing supports for cultural centres including local and regional museums, as well as for new online cultural and creative content to build on the success of programmes such as <i>Ireland Performs</i>and the Other Voices <i>Courage</i>programme.</p><p>Organisations and individuals currently funded under the Arts Council Strategic Funding, Arts Centre Funding, Arts Grant Funding and Festival Investment Scheme, Round 1 were advised at the beginning of this crisis that the Arts Council would honour all funding commitments that have been made to them and that there would be no financial penalties for organisations/individuals that are unable to deliver key activities/key services arising from the impact of the COVID-19 virus.  </p><p>Organisations that face cash flow challenges during this time are able to draw down up to 90% of their Arts Council funding commitment. This should, in turn, assist them in honouring immediate financial commitments.  Organisations are asked to prioritise commitments to artists &ndash; as this is a particularly challenging time for them.</p><p>Last October saw the announcement of a new &euro;4.7m Capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres. The new capital investment scheme is to run until 2022 and is focused on securing and enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres that operate as not-for-profit organisations throughout the country and has a clearly defined arts and culture focus. This funding is made available under the Department's capital plan -<i>Project Ireland 2040 -Investing in our Culture, Language &amp;amp; Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027. </i></p><p>In response to the COVID-19 crisis I recently announced further funding from this capital envelope. It will provide emergency funding to facilitate the safe re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues.  The measures are designed to support arts and culture facilities in preparation for staff, artists and audiences returning work in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business and Return to Work Safety Protocols.  The Guidelines for the Scheme and Application Form are available on my Department&rsquo;s website</p><p>The Government has also extended its two universal income support measures for all sectors.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment, operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, currently extended to 10 August.  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), operated by the Revenue Commissioners, has been extended to 31 August and allows employers to retain the link with employees so that when the crisis passes, people can get back to work as quickly and seamlessly as possible.</p></reply>

This initiative includes works to significant historic buildings, streetscape conservation and the public realm and demonstrates the effective way that heritage can be used to regenerate urban centres. </p><p>The internationally recognised practice of heritage-led regeneration shows that heritage can be used to create a desirable place where people can live, visit and do business. It brings economic benefits to enable our historic towns to prosper through increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises. The towns are selected following a competitive process inviting each local authority to apply in respect of one historic town with an indicative minimum population of 1,500 inhabitants. Priority is given to projects that are &lsquo;plan-led&rsquo; and likely to make a meaningful contribution to the heritage-led regeneration of the town. Full details on how to apply for the HTI are available on the Heritage Council&rsquo;s website.  </p><p>The Minister of State for Heritage and Electoral Reform, Malcolm Noonan, TD, along with the Heritage Council, recently announced funding of &euro;1 million, to be shared by six towns under the 2020 programme. These towns are </p><p>- Tralee, Co Kerry</p><p>- Ramelton, Co Donegal </p><p>- Ballina, Co Mayo  </p><p>- Roscommon, Co Roscommon.</p><p>- Sligo, Co Sligo</p><p>- Clones, Co Monaghan. </p><p>While almost all Irish towns are historic in origin, including those of medieval and pre-medieval foundation, plantation towns, planned estate towns and those established around local industries there is no formal process in my Department by which towns can apply for designation as a &lsquo;heritage town&rsquo;.  understand that in 1991, Bord F&aacute;ilte proposed a Heritage Town Programme to transform some of Ireland&rsquo;s historic towns into tourist attractions in their own right and a total of 34 towns were originally designated as heritage towns under that programme. I also understand that a small number of the towns continue to market themselves under the brand of &lsquo;heritage town&rsquo; although F&aacute;ilte Ireland is no longer involved in such designation either.</p></reply>

These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). This year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country will benefit from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes.  </p>  <p>  This funding will support the owners and custodians of historic and protected structures as they carry out hundreds of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and safeguard our built heritage as well as providing vital support for local jobs in conservation, traditional skills and construction.  Details of all projects approved for 2020 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on each local authority website. However, given the scale of investment needed for larger projects, such as the one mentioned, it is likely that the levels of grant funding available under these schemes would not be sufficient. </p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building or historic structure, the best advice is generally to contact the Heritage Officer or Architectural Conservation Officer in the local authority who is well placed to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with its renovation or conservation.  The Deputy may be aware that Dublin City Council, in fact, purchased, rescued, stabilised and conserved No. 14 Henrietta Street, preserving it for generations to come. In September 2018, it opened to the public as a museum of tenement life allowing visitors to experience over 300 years of city life, from its grand Georgian beginnings to the tenement dwellings of its later years. It is, of course, situated next door to 15 Henrietta Street.</p></reply>

Since then the disease has been confirmed in hares in three counties - Dublin, Wexford and most recently Kildare - and in wild rabbits from 12 counties: Carlow, Clare, Cork, Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Leitrim, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow. While most of the reports are from the end of 2019, a number of new records of the disease were confirmed last week in rabbits from Clare and Cork and in hares from Wexford and Kildare.</p>  <p>  The virus is known to be highly contagious and easily spread, and environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses. The disease is known to have caused significant mortality among rabbits in parts of Ireland and the spillover into both the Irish hare population and domestic pet rabbits raises additional concerns. While a vaccine is available for pet rabbits this is not an option for wild animals.</p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department are working with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop a national survey of RHD2 in rabbits. This will involve sampling rabbits from hunting bags at different locations in every county of Ireland. All animals will be tested for RHD2 virus (which will demonstrate the presence of the disease) and RHD2 antibodies (to confirm previous exposure  to the virus and subsequent recovery). </p>  <p>  The results will provide a snapshot of the prevalence of RHD2 nationally in wild Irish rabbits and will hopefully highlight any geographical patterns that may be present. The results will also indicate if the prevalence of animals with detectable antibodies provides evidence that &lsquo;herd immunity&rsquo; to the disease is developing among the rabbit population. It is hoped that an improved knowledge of the disease in rabbits will enhance our understanding of the risks that this disease poses to Irish hares.</p></reply>

Waterways Ireland is also responsible for complying with environmental legislation including the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Fisheries Acts ( the canals are coarse fisheries of national significance). The canals are also proposed Natural Heritage Areas; of national significance from a conservation perspective, and are protected under the Wildlife Acts. </p><p>The functions of Waterways Ireland relate only to the management, maintenance, restoration and development of inland waterways.  It has no powers or functions in regard to the provision of accommodation for those who might need it.  The by-laws governing the use of inland waterways were introduced in 1988: .</p><p>Residential moorings on any inland waterways do require planning permission and infrastructure. This would be required  for the safe provision of water, sewage, location for bins, and access and egress for emergency vehicles. Recreational access to canals for members of the public, which are public amenities of significant cultural and heritage value, would also need to be retained. Any plan or development proposal is also considered in relation to relevant County or City Development Plans and any locally impacted community.</p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Noonan recently met the Acting CEO of Waterways Ireland to discuss, among other issues, sustainable urban canals and their communities.  Our canals and navigable waterways are essential components of our built and natural heritage, which can accommodate unique and vibrant communities, harbour biodiversity and host youth and leisure amenities.  Waterways Ireland will engage in a collaborative process with all stakeholders around finding a long term, sustainable solution to regularise the use of the canals, recognising the cultural and heritage value of our canal network as living communities of people and ecology. The process, with community and sustainability at its heart will seed the future strategy. </p><p>Waterways Ireland is working on a ten-year strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways. As part of this exercise, it will examine all opportunities to develop, over the next decade, initiatives for each of its navigations. These will include areas on and along the country&rsquo;s inland waterways infrastructure. Plans will be consistent with its remit; its funding; and will involve consultation and engagement with the many diverse stakeholders within the catchment areas.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework (NPF) is Ireland&rsquo;s long-term national spatial planning strategy to accommodate projected future population and economic growth over a 20-year period to 2040. </p>  <p>  The other principal element of Project Ireland is the current National Development Plan (NDP), which sets out a &euro;116 billion public capital investment envelope in support of the NPF, to 2027. The aligned and shared vision of the NPF in tandem with the NDP, is an integrated, &lsquo;joined-up&rsquo; planning and investment strategy, focused on a series of ten shared national outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to review of the National Development Plan (NDP) to be brought forward from 2022, to set out an updated NDP for the period to 2031.  The Programme for Government also confirms that the updated NDP will remain aligned with the spatial planning strategy in the NPF.  Accordingly, it is not proposed to review the NPF at this time. </p>  <p>  The NPF sits at the top of a hierarchy of statutory spatial development plans, the purpose of which is to ensure the sustainable development of urban and rural areas, secure balanced regional development and to support and co-ordinate proper planning and development throughout Ireland. This national-level planning policy is being implemented at the regional level through statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) for the three Regional Assembly areas.</p>  <p>  Further to the NPF, a RSES was prepared by each of the three Regional Assemblies in Ireland, all of which were approved and in place by January 2020.  In accordance with Section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, subsequent review of each County Development Plan must be consistent with both the NPF and the relevant Regional Strategy.  In addition, since April 2019, Development Plan review processes have been overseen by the independent Office of the Planning Regulator. </p></reply>

The Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business planning funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets, including &euro;1.9bn for waste water, and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs. In regard to overall investment, the Programme for Government states that the Government will fund Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. This overall funding commitment is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Irish Water brought forward proposals for a Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme, as part of its Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024 submitted to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the National Planning Framework. The Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. Irish Water will work with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies. I understand that Irish Water is currently advancing its proposals on this programme. </p>  <p>  In addition to the support the plan gives to sewered locations in urban and rural Ireland, Irish Water is also prepared to support local authorities who wish to seek funding for un-sewered villages through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund of the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  Further detail in relation to the breakdown of Irish Water's capital investment should be sought from Irish Water. </p>  <p>  Of note also is the Working Group established by my Department in April 2018 to conduct a review of rural water services. There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 considered the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021 (which was announced last year), while Strand 2 is considering the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector. The wastewater infrastructure needs of rural villages is an issue that the Working Group is to examine further.</p></reply>

The Policy Statement gives clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans.  The Policy Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>In addition to the above, Irish Water is also regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator.  The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs.  This CRU process involves, inter alia, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its capital investment plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives, as set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) and its Strategic Funding Plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods.

The Act allows the Minister to prescribe that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  No regulations in respect of section 9 have been made to date, and section 9 has not been commenced.  Commencement of the various sections  of the Act is under active consideration, and it had been intended that the bulk of the provisions would be operational for the 2021 local authority budget cycle, in November 2020.  However, commencement will be delayed due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.  </p><p>Notwithstanding that, there is existing legislation in place that provides for a refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances.  The Local Government Act 1946, provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable. With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area, shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above). Guidance has been provided to local authorities and elected members in that regard. A decision to vary the level of rate refund applying is a reserved function of elected members of a local authority.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

As a short term measure, &euro;136m was made available to local authorities as cash flow support in early April, in order to ensure that vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.  This support was comprised of the early payment of the LPT allocation ordinarily paid from the Local Government Fund in May and July.

The Code is overseen by an Interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office based in the Housing Agency. </p>  <p>  When the Regulation Office receives a regulatory return for an AHB it assesses that organisation in line with their size, scope of activity and risk profile. The office assesses AHBs against the Code and standards.  Following this assessment, if an AHB is not meeting key requirements under the Code they may be entered into engagement. An AHB entered into engagement will work with the Regulation Office to obtain a satisfactory assessment. This is a fluid process with AHBs entering and exiting engagement at various times. </p>  <p>  All funding to AHBs is provided via the local authorities as the latter are the statutory housing authorities for their areas. All social housing provision in each area, including by AHBs, must be provided with the approval and oversight of the relevant local authorities. The local authority determines whether an AHB project is to be approved or not, based on housing need and suitability of the proposed development. The AHB enters into a contract with the local authority and must abide by the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme.</p>  <p>  There are a range of funding and delivery mechanisms available to local authorities to deliver social housing supports in partnership with AHBs. In accordance with Department Circular 15/2016, only those AHBs that have signed up to the Code and have undergone a satisfactory assessment as part of the assessment process by the Regulation Office are considered eligible for new funding. Once a local authority has entered into a contract with an AHB, prior to them entering into engagement with the Regulation Office, that funding may continue.  </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  A review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been recently finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect that the review will be published once all the work on these reform measures is completed.</p></reply>

With a maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per home, at least 6,200 affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, SSF funding of &euro;127 million has been allocated in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes. </p><p>Details of all projects that have received funding approval in principle are available at the following location;</p><p>.</p><p>The ultimate selling prices of affordable homes will obviously be influenced by a number of factors which will vary significantly from development to development. This includes the overall development cost of each particular project, the housing type/tenure mix involved, and the local housing market.  Given that the detailed design, planning and procurement process have yet to be completed and as the open market value of homes cannot be ascertained until the homes are made available at the time of sale, it is not possible to confirm in advance the local authority equity stake in the homes or the ultimate final sales price in advance.  However, I can confirm that applications for SSF funding were made by local authorities on the basis of being able to deliver homes for sale at discounts of between 10% and a maximum of 40% below open market prices.</p><p>Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 (under which affordable homes for purchase supported by the SSF are to be sold) a charge will be placed on the property equal to the percentage discount from open market value, giving the housing authority an equity stake in the property. The amount charged must be repaid at the end of the charged period (which must be at least 25 years) but may be paid off in installments at any time after the first 5 years of the charged period. This will ensure the sustainability of the funding model so more people can be helped meet their housing needs in the future.</p></reply>

This requires extensive design, planning, public consultation and procurement processes in advance of the projects moving to construction. </p>  <p>  In 2018, 30 projects received final LIHAF approval with an overall budget of &euro;195.7m, of which &euro;146.8m will be Exchequer funded, with the remainder funded via local authorities.  Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although an element of the housing that was associated with the project has taken place.</p>  <p>  Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p>  <p>  Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of June 2020 (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage and one is expected to have tender approval and go to construction before the end of Q4 2020.

In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support.  From the scheme's introduction in 2012 to the end of June 2020, 691 families have remained in their homes under the scheme and at the end of June 2020 1,342 applications were actively being progressed.  </p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme undertaken in 2017 introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the Scheme in order to improve its operation.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website, www.mortgagetorent.ie, dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers was developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements were put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the Review means that MTR is available to provide a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress, where appropriate. Building on that work, and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I am considering how the scheme could be further improved to meet the needs of more borrowers who require long-term support with their housing needs. </p></reply>

Within this context, the three Regional Assemblies, had significant scope to determine their own settlement strategies, further to the NPF</p>  <p>  For example, Chapter 3 (pages 28-41) of the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA) area, sets out a very clear and detailed growth strategy for the EMRA region.  Table 3.1 of the EMRA RSES in particular, identifies a series of &lsquo;asset-based&rsquo; criteria, on which the overall EMRA RSES settlement strategy is based. </p>  <p>  In the same way as the NPF enabled greater detail to be determined at Regional Assembly level, the RSESs don&rsquo;t address every settlement in each Region and enables each County to determine their own settlement strategy within the parameters of the RSES, through the County Development Plan process.</p>  <p>  Further to finalisation of the three RSESs by January 2020, all city and county development plans must be reviewed or varied, to ensure consistency with both the NPF, and the relevant RSES.  This process is underway and will continue into 2021, overseen by the independent Office of the Planning Regulator. When complete, this will be the first time that there has been an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans, supported by the national public capital investment programme, to shape the future pattern and form of development in Ireland.</p></reply>

Funding and policy responsibility at a local level rests with the local authorities and at national level with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Local authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government. Central Government funding of local authorities includes transfers, both current and capital, from a range of Departments and Offices for a variety of purposes. In relation to the provision of leisure centres in their areas, local authorities would ordinarily seek such central Government funding from the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport, as my Department has no direct role in that policy function.</p>  <p>  I intend to continue to support measures taken by my Department to assist local authorities with the financial challenges they are experiencing since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a short term measure &euro;136m was made available to local authorities as cash flow support in early April, in order to ensure that vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.  This support was comprised of the early payment of the LPT allocation ordinarily paid from the Local Government Fund in May and July. Further to these measures, my Department arranged for the payment of 50% of each local authority&rsquo;s individual Payroll and PSPR allocation, amounting to &euro;54.8m, in mid-June. This interim payment would ordinarily be paid later in July.</p>  <p>  On 2 May 2020, a waiver of commercial rates was announced for businesses that were forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. This issue is under active consideration in the context of the July stimulus.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that additional costs are being incurred by local authorities in relation to Covid-19. Local authorities have been advised to capture all related costs in their financial systems to aid future financial analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the local government sector. In order to support the sector generally, I will ensure my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow under review and will continue to work with all local authorities, both collectively and individually, on issues arising.</p></reply>

These UCCs were based on returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, updated from published tender index information, with the most recent set of UCCs being produced in Q1 2019.</p><p>It was intended that updated UCCs would issue to local authorities at the end of Q1 2020, however, the impact of Covid-19 on construction activity meant that this updating was deferred until such a time as sufficient market data is available and the impact on construction tender prices is clearer.

Under this scheme, Deeds of Bravery Awards are given to people who have saved a human life involving personal risk to themselves. </p>  <p>  Comhairle na M&iacute;re Gaile - the Council for the Recognition of Deeds of Bravery - is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, and it meets on an annual basis to consider and decide on the awards to be made.  The scheme has been in operation since 1947, and awards are presented in four categories &ndash; gold, silver, bronze and a certificate of recognition.  Further information relating to the Bravery Awards may be found at: www.bravery.ie. I understand that a number of members of the fire service from all over the country have been recognised under the Scheme for their courageous acts.</p>  <p>  I wish to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the vital contribution made to our society by the men and women of the local authority fire services. Fire services are trained to operate as teams, to evaluate each emergency situation and to undertake appropriate risk assessments to ensure the safety of the public they serve as well as their colleagues and themselves. Given the focus on teamwork and risk assessment, I have no current plans to introduce a separate bravery awards scheme for individual members of local authority fire services staff, however, I am open to consulting and seeking the views of fire service representatives on the matter.</p>  <p>  In 1992, a scheme of long service awards for personnel in the local authority fire services was launched.  There are four categories of awards, marking service of ten years, twenty years, thirty years and forty years.  The ten-year award is a certificate presented locally, while the twenty-, thirty- and forty- year awards all involve the presentation of medals and certificates at a national ceremony. The twenty-year award is a medal bearing the traditional logo representation of the fire service - a helmet and crossed axes.  The thirty-year award is a flame emblem.  The forty-year award is a bar; both the emblem and bar attach onto the medal ribbon.  </p>  <p>  The first national awards presentation was organised in 1998 and is now held every two years at a national presentation ceremony. The latest of these ceremonies was held in November 2018 at which 288 fire service personnel were eligible for awards. </p></reply>

As the 2019-2023 roster exists within the framework of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Department gave careful thought to the justification, and the legal basis, for publishing the names of roster members. This included detailed consideration of the Guidance Note on the Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data, which the Data Protection Commission (DPC) issued in December 2019. It also included separate consultations with the DPC and the roster members.  Those consultations concluded on 10 July 2020.  In accordance with GDPR article 6(1)(f), I am releasing these names to the public record by attaching them to this response. </p><p>The DPC noted that the Department had carried out a comprehensive analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the processing, as well as a balancing exercise between the rights and freedoms of the data subjects involved and the public interest, and had also identified appropriate safeguards for the personal data. The DPC raised a number of important matters: the GDPR right to be forgotten, the possibility of other information being inferred, or inferable, as a result of publication of the names, and whether there had been incidents of members of the roster having suffered harm as a result of being identified. The DPC stressed that it would be essential to communicate any changes to members of the roster, to ensure that their feedback is heard. Finally it was advised that the data privacy notice provided to members of the roster should make explicit to them how they can exercise their data protection rights.

I have personally been very engaged in efforts to keep the issue high on the international agenda. I have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine, most recently in December 2019. I have also consistently engaged on this issue at EU and UN level, and I will continue to do so.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that the Government will &ldquo;Honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the frustration felt both in Palestine and here in Ireland over the lack of progress towards a two-state solution, I have been clear that I would be prepared to recommend to the Government early recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful.  This is an issue where there could be benefits to moving in step with EU partners, and it is a matter that I discuss regularly with EU colleagues.  </p>  <p>  However, recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement would also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level. Timing and context would affect whether this loss of influence would be matched by delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process. I am continuing to monitor the situation closely. </p></reply>

The human rights situation in Iran is very worrying, with routine violations of human rights including restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture of detainees. There are numerous and credible reports of torture of those detained in Iranian prisons. Ireland opposes the use of the death penalty whenever it occurs and, while I note that there has been a significant fall in the number of executions in Iran since 2017, I remain shocked by the regular use of the death penalty, particularly in respect of minors. </p><p>Ireland raises human rights issues with Iran<b></b>at every suitable opportunity.

The report was published on the Department's website following its circulation to those who made disclosures.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps and the wider Defence organisation is committed to complying with health and safety legislation.

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years 2019 to 2022, including two new primary schools to serve the Swords school planning area (North and South). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  Rivervalley CNS opened in September 2019 as a single stream school in interim accommodation at Feltrim Road, Swords.  It will move to further interim accommodation for September 2020 and will be located at 85/87 Main Street Swords.</p>  <p>  Broadmeadow CNS is due to be established as a single stream school in September 2020.  It will be accommodated in interim accommodation at Mooretown, Swords.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, a major building project for St. Cronan&rsquo;s Senior National School includes the demolition of the existing Senior National School building and prefabricated classrooms and the construction of a new two-storey primary school comprising 26 general classrooms plus a 2 classroom SEN Base. The project also includes a new single-storey extension of 2 general classrooms plus a 2 classroom SEN Base to the rear of the existing St. Cronan&rsquo;s Junior National School.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools is under ongoing review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous with regard to the management of their academic affairs and retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures in this area.  In relation to fees the student contribution charge covers the cost of elements such as student registration, admissions and examination fees. However, repeat examination fees are charged separately being set by the individual HEI concerned and the Minister does not have a function in this regard.</p><p>In terms of supports for third level students, the main support available is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. To qualify for grant support, a student is required to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in HEIs experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF is managed by the Higher Education Authority and is allocated annually to prescribed HEIs including universities.  Under the SAF students may be assisted towards the costs of rent, childcare, transport and books/class materials etc. The fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of the SAF are available from the Access Office in the institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>It is noted that NUI Galway, which is referenced specifically by the Deputies, states that there is limited support available in relation to the payment of repeat examination fees in certain prescribed circumstances, details of which are to be found on their website: </p><p>In addition, it is incumbent upon HEIs to have policies and complaints procedures in place which provide a mechanism for students to resolve any grievances, details of which would be accessible on their website. If an individual feels that he or she has been unfairly treated, or is not satisfied with an institution&rsquo;s decision on his or her complaint, it is open to that individual to contact the Office of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman examines complaints from the public in relation to certain actions of education providers including HEIs. Further information on the complaint procedures of the Office of the Ombudsman is below for the Deputies' information.</p><p>  ">Higher Education Institutions</p></reply>

To establish that the nearest school is full parents/guardians must provide certain documentary evidence including that an application for enrolment in the nearest school was made within the deadline dates specified by the school and confirmation from the school authorities that the school was full.</p>  <p>  To date insufficient evidence has been received from the family referred to by the Deputy.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.</p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source. This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.</p>  <p>  The Calculated Grades Executive Office in my Department has developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out-of-school learners &ndash; those students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and has contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was Thursday 2 July 2020 and applications are now being processed.</p>  <p>  In cases where a student who is attending school, but who is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department.</p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed.</p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates.</p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Calculated Grades Executive Office has received an application in respect of the candidate named above.</p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Executive Office in respect of any of students studying independently, to date.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.  This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes.  The CGEO will notify the Central Applications Office (CAO) of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from matriculation/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years 2019 to 2022. This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.</p>  <p>  While the 2018 announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Gorey school planning area, the requirement for new schools or school places is under ongoing review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years 2019 to 2022. This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.</p>  <p>  While the 2018 announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Gorey school planning area, the requirement for new schools or school places is under ongoing review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p>  <p>  The second level School Planning Area for Gorey, Co. Wexford, is catered for by two schools, Gorey Community School and Creagh College.</p>  <p>  My Department approved capital funding for Gorey Community School to provide additional classroom and specialist accommodation last April. This accommodation, when constructed, will cater for approximately 1,550 pupils. The project has been devolved to the school authorities for delivery. A new school building catering for 1,000 pupils was constructed for Creagh College in 2014.</p></reply>

The student is pursuing a course leading to accreditation on the National Qualifications Framework (e.g. Junior Certificate/Leaving Certificate Applied/FETAC 3)</p>  <p>  2. The student requires one additional year in order to complete their course</p>  <p>  3. Retaining the student in the school for one school year will not prevent a younger pupil being enrolled there</p>  <p>  4. Plans are in place to transition the student to a post-school setting at the end of the additional school year</p>  <p>  Special schools are invited each year to make applications for exemptions from Rule 64(1) in respect of pupils who meet the above criteria. Where the criteria are met, my Department will approve the exemptions.</p>  <p>  The school to which the Deputy refers has engaged in this process with my Department. I can also confirm that an application for exemptions, as referenced above, was made by the school. However, as the criteria were not met, it was not possible to approve the application. The school has been notified of this decision.</p>  <p>  Some people with a disability, over the age of 18, and who have complex needs, may require specialised support throughout their lives.  Ongoing care and support services within the community, in a post-school setting, are provided by voluntary or statutory organisations. Responsibility for such care and support rests with the HSE.</p>  <p>  Special school staff typically have extensive engagement with parents, HSE multi-disciplinary teams and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which involves planning for the student&rsquo;s future, including options for further education, training, employment or other placement options subject to the student&rsquo;s abilities, including the transition to adult services when they reach the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that students with complex special educational needs who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or, in adult settings, which are allocated resources towards educational provision.</p>  <p>  I understand that transition between school and post school settings can be a difficult time for students with special educational needs and their families and more so this year due to the COVID-19 crisis. I am also aware though that transition planning for these students will have been well advanced by their schools prior to the school closures.</p>  <p>  Since schools closed last March, supports have been provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning. In addition to the general guidance, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased almost threefold, from 548 to 1,618 for the 2019/2020 school year, with 1,353 of these catering for children with autism.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for an additional 265 special class teachers in 2020, which will allow for the opening of additional classes where required.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places national to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However, there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.</p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.</p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37.  A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on 29 October 2019 following a report by the NCSE which identified children in South Dublin needing special education school places. Since then, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity amongst schools in the South Dublin area.</p>  <p>  On 21 April 2020 my Department received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The report identifies the schools who it is considered have potential to provide additional places.  These schools were identified following an extensive engagement with schools and their patron bodies and parents in the area.</p>  <p>  Having considered the report, the Minister accepted the opinion of the NCSE and statutory notices were served on 39 schools in the area on 26 June last. All schools have been afforded the opportunity to make representations in respect of the notices served. Both the notices served together with the representations received to date from the school authorities and their Patrons have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I understand that some progress has already been made and the NCSE is working with a number of schools to establish classes for this coming school year.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE, will continue to work through the next steps in this process.</p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information.</p>  <p>  All purchasing undertaken by schools of exchequer provided funding must be in compliance with Public Procurement Procedures.  Existing ICT purchasing Frameworks are in place operated by the Office of Government procurement for Desktop PCs/Notebooks/etc, with appropriately defined technical specifications.  These Frameworks should be engaged with and taken advantage of as they simplify the process of purchasing ICT equipment for schools.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheets on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital technology, including Laptop/tablet devices, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.).</p>  <p>  My Department has put in place a range of supports for schools, teachers, pupils and parents to ensure development of appropriate policies and to raise awareness around the appropriate use of digital technology including the publication of the circular referred to requiring consultation on the issue of the use of digital devices in schools.</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment, and affirms that the use of digital technology can enhance the teaching and learning experience. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;110m issued over the last three years and a further &euro;50m has recently been issued in respect of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>  <p>  In the context of the current public health crisis the funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs including devices, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning.  This can include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning.</p></reply>

Collaboration is necessary to create the critical mass for world-leading research in many disciplines. Government agencies including Enterprise Ireland, Knowledge Transfer Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish research Council are proactive in this area with their enterprise-facing schemes.</p>  <p>  Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) is the national office that helps enterprises to benefit from access to Irish expertise and technology by making it simple to connect and engage with the research base in Ireland.  KTI works with business, investors, universities, Institutes of Technology, State research organisations, research funders and government agencies to maximise access to State-funded technology, ideas and expertise in order to drive innovation.</p>  <p>  Mobility between industry and academia forges important linkages between research and innovation performers and is a vital element of a researcher&rsquo;s development, providing the opportunities to gain first-hand experience in a commercial research environment while also providing industry with access to highly specialised trained researchers from the HEIs. Through Innovation 2020 there is enhanced existing support for the bilateral flow of researchers between academia and industry through programmes including the Science Foundation Ireland Industry Fellowship and the Irish Research Council Employment-based Postgraduate and Enterprise Partnership programmes.</p>  <p>  In relation to the establishment of a skills and facilities register of the type referred to, there is a need to be cognisant of the commercial sensitivities of industry with regard to an open register detailing information of research and development activities.

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning.</p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  The reopening in time for the start of the new school year remains a top priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.</p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC and the NCCA in the development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.</p></reply>

The importance of informing students of arrangements for the new semester in a timely manner forms part of these discussions and all those involved are committed to this. This work is ongoing, and it is hoped that a communication for the sector will be published later this month.</p>  <p>  However, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are autonomous institutions and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes. Decisions on how courses and campus services will operate will be made by each institution, and arrangements will vary between institutions and between courses. The HEIs will communicate the arrangements for the new academic year to students as soon as these arrangements have been finalised. Questions on arrangements for a specific institution or course should be directed to the institution in question.</p></reply>

All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services.</p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

The grant allocation is approved on an annual basis with the conditions of funding set out in the annual allocation letter which includes full compliance with the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014.</p>  <p>  The circular outlines the public financial management principles, procedures, and additional reporting requirements that must be followed in the governance of grant funding as well as compliance with all public financial procedures and legislation. The overall principle is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money in line with economy, efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure compliance with these requirements, as grantor, my Department must ensure that it has an effective grant-funding supervision regime in place for all of the grants it administers to inform evidence based decision making and to ensure it achieves best value for money in the use of public monies.</p>  <p>  In line with its obligations as grantor, my Department carried out a review of funding of the project in 2011 and has since then provided over &euro;1.3 million in funding for the project.</p>  <p>  In correspondence with the organisation in 2019 my Department advised that it was planning a review of funding of the project as one of a number of grants under similar review.  The review commenced in Quarter 4, 2019 and it was intended to complete the series of reviews by the end Quarter 1, 2020.  However, owing to COVID-19 this has not been possible.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that my Department will continue to fund the project in 2020 pending completion of the review. In this regard, three quarterly instalments of the 2020 grant have been paid to the organisation, the most recent having been paid last month.</p></reply>

The Government has set employment recovery as its top priority and the jobs stimulus package to be announced later this month will assist people back into work. Any further changes to the pandemic unemployment payment will be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  A two-level payment structure to link the payment to gross prior earnings was recently introduced. Where an employee's gross weekly earnings were &euro;200 or higher there is no change to their rate of payment.  If their gross weekly earnings were under &euro;200 the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment was adjusted to &euro;203.  Where a person is self-employed their average weekly income for 2018 was used to determine their rate of payment for the pandemic unemployment payment. This is the last tax year for which complete data on self-employed income is available.</p>  <p>  The conditions for receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment are that a person must have lost their employment due to the pandemic and are now fully unemployed. A self-employed person must have suffered a collapse in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work. Where a self-employed individual has regular employment or it generates significant income, then they should close their pandemic unemployment payment on the basis that they do not satisfy the conditions for the payment. In cases of doubt where emergency or sporadic work is undertaken, an individual should discuss the matter with the Department.</p>  <p>  If a person is ineligible for the pandemic unemployment payment as they are engaged in employment, they may be entitled to support under the jobseekers benefit or jobseekers allowance scheme depending on their individual circumstances. A person in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment may take up employment but they must be unemployed for at least 4 days in 7 consecutive days to be eligible for a payment and continue to satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the schemes. Jobseekers benefit (self-employed) is available for self-employed people who have ceased trading and is not available while a person is engaged in self-employment.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant has recently been extended and will be made available to small business owners who transition from the pandemic unemployment payment to reopen their business. The grant, of up to &euro;1,000, will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants. The Department is developing the systems to put it into effect and will communicate how to access the grant in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Moreover, Ireland&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate has been significantly lower than the EU27 rate for a number of years now, which highlights the progress that had been made in Ireland&rsquo;s labour market recovery in recent years.</p><p>However, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting labour market conditions, the CSO estimated youth unemployment to be at 12.8 percent for June, with the COVID-adjusted rate at just over 45 percent.  This COVID-adjusted rate is considered to be the upper bound, as all claimants of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment who are not already included on the Live Register are classified as unemployed.</p><p>While planning for economic recovery it is crucial that we provide young people with holistic supports to assist them back to work and support new young entrants to compete for job vacancies in a competitive labour market.  We must also not forget our disadvantaged youths who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and face significant barriers to work.</p><p>Building and enhancing the skills of the workforce will be an important element of economic recovery, having regard to the skills currently in demand and those likely to be in demand by employers in the future. SOLAS are working in partnership with officials in my Department to develop an agile response which brings together and builds on existing further education and training expertise and resources to provide the recently unemployed cohort with the &lsquo;Skills to Compete&rsquo; in the labour market.  This activation initiative will support young people to develop their transversal skills and increase employability; build digital competency so as to flourish in the changing world of work; and participate in specific training targeting growth sectors and occupations.</p><p>Intreo, the public employment service which provides job search and activation supports, will maintain a close relationship with SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) at a national and local level to identify appropriate opportunities for referral to re-skilling and upskilling opportunities for young jobseekers.</p></reply>

Many sectors and industries have been badly affected by the measures the Irish Government, like many other governments across the globe, has had to take in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is probably fair to say that sectors associated with travel, tourism and aviation have been affected more than most.</p>  <p>  Having come through previous difficulties, I understand how difficult it must be for the employees involved to now face more renegotiations, restructuring and possibly lay-offs.  I greatly respect the efforts of workers and workers&rsquo; representatives to ensure that they get the best possible outcome from the situation.  I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is an offence under the Act for an employer to fail to comply with sections 9 or 10.</p>  <p>  There is also an obligation under section 12 which makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection of the proposed collective redundancy.  I received official notification of the proposed collective redundancies in the company concerned in letters dated 23rd March and 19th June 2020, which my officials inform me complied with the requirements under section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  It is also an offence under section 11 of the Act where an employer fails to comply with sections 9 or 10.</p>  <p>  There is also an obligation under section 12 which makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection of the proposed collective redundancy.  My predecessor received official notification of the proposed collective redundancies in the company concerned in a letter dated 21st of May 2020, which complied with the requirements under section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.</p>  <p>  In relation to redundancy payments, it is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy entitlements to eligible employees.  An employer is only legally obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Any arrangement outside statutory redundancy is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employees (and their union representatives) and employers through an industrial relations process, which can be assisted by the WRC.</p>  <p>  Company law matters are a responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Leo Varadkar, T.D.</p>  <p>  The High Court has confirmed the appointment of an examiner to the company concerned.  It is for the examiner to consult creditors, potential investors and other relevant parties to devise the most appropriate course of action in the interests of the survival of the company and put that course of action to the court for approval.</p>  <p>  In all cases, under the Companies Act, proposals arising from an examinership are brought before the Court, which decides whether to confirm them, with or without modifications, or reject them.  Under the Act, the Court cannot confirm proposals unless it is satisfied that a number of criteria are met, including that the proposals are not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party.</p>  <p>  At a hearing, any member or creditor whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the proposals is entitled to object to their confirmation on a number of specified grounds under Section 543 of the Act.  The Court will have the final say and, until then, the company is under its protection.</p>  <p>  The statutory framework for examinership, including the requirement for Court oversight under the Companies Act 2014, is structured to provide that account is taken of the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, in a company.</p>  <p>  If the workers affected have concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights, the mechanism for them to use is the Workplace Relations Commission.  The WRC is the organisation which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The Customer Service section of the WRC operates a telephone helpline at 1890 808090.  They can provide further information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department held a series of meetings with CE supervisor representatives to consider related proposals, mindful of the operating environment in which any potential solution will need to exist.</p>  <p>  Related discussions also continued between officials from my Department and their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).</p></reply>

Currently, the obligation to register a death rests with the relatives of the deceased, or in their absence, other persons specified in the Act.  A death must be registered within three months of the date of death.  However, there are no sanctions if a death is registered beyond that time period.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, only four in every five deaths are registered within this timeframe.  The manner and operation of the death registration process has been identified by the General Register Office (GRO) as an area requiring reform to ensure it meets with domestic and international public health and reporting requirements for life events.  The GRO is leading an inter-agency working group to modernise the way deaths are notified and subsequently registered.  This work is timely as it coincides with recommendations made by the National Public Health Emergency Team to reduce the length of time between the date of death and registration.</p>  <p>  The working group is nearing completion of its work and I expect that the proposals it will bring forward will be subject to public and stakeholder engagement before being considered by the Government in the autumn.  It is likely that legislative changes will then be needed to the Civil Registration Act.</p>  <p>  The objective is to ensure that the current timeframe for death registration is reduced to a matter of weeks.  To achieve this, significant technological and process changes will be required.

A two level payment structure has been introduced to link the pandemic unemployment payment level to prior earnings. </p>  <p>  If a recipient&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings were &euro;200 or higher then there is no change to their rate of payment. If a person&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings were under &euro;200 then the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment has been adjusted to &euro;203 per week which is in line with the standard personal rate of jobseeker's benefit. The majority of recipients, approximately 75%, have not been impacted by this change in rate. </p>  <p>  A person&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings are determined by reference to earnings data supplied by Revenue. Amounts paid by way of maternity benefit are not included in the calculation of gross weekly earnings. </p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s rate is reduced to the flat rate &euro;203 per week and their family circumstances are that they have adult or child dependents in their household it may be more financially beneficial to apply for a jobseekers payment.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.  </p></reply>

This gives them an entitlement to a reduced rate of State pension (contributory), at 75% of the maximum rate, which has been awarded since 2 March 2012.  </p>  <p>  The person is in receipt of the correct rate of State pension (contributory), commensurate with their insurance record since December 1960 as held by my Department.  Their pension entitlement was confirmed in writing on 16 July 2020, enclosing a copy of their insurance record on which the decision was based.  Class J contributions recorded for the tax year 1990/91 are not qualifying contributions for pension purposes. If the person concerned considers they have additional contributions or credits that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence to my Department and their pension entitlement can be reviewed.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government announced a new calculation method for state pension (contributory), including the introduction of new HomeCaring Periods, for people born on or after 1 September 1946, who were awarded state pension (contributory) based on reduced post-Budget 2012 rate bands.  On 29 April 2019 the person concerned requested a review of their pension entitlement in light of those changes.  They were advised that, as their date of birth is before 1 September 1946, they are not within the cohort of pensioners included in this pension review.</p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to consider applying for State pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested, residency-based payment for people of pension age.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the applicant and spouse/civil partner/cohabitant.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition).  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  The legislation provides for increases to the State pension age - to 67 in 2021 and further to 68 in 2028.  </p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; states that the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred.  This will require amendment to primary legislation and the Government will bring in the necessary legislation later this year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a Commission on Pensions will be established to examine sustainability and eligibility issues in relation to State pensions and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission is to report to Government by June 2021 on options including the qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.  The Government will take action, having regard to the recommendations of the Commission, within six months.  Pending the Commission&rsquo;s report and any subsequent Government decisions on its recommendations, it is intended that the State pension age will remain at 66 years as at present.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also proposes an &ldquo;Early Retirement Allowance or Pension&rdquo; for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The new payment will be introduced as early as possible for those who are retired from employment.  Officials in my Department are currently considering the design of the scheme and assessing the necessary legislation, ICT system requirements and administrative processes required for the introduction of this payment.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is an income support payment for both employees and the self-employed who have become fully unemployed due to a downturn in economic activity related to Covid-19.

The person concerned also provided a letter from his former employer confirming this information.  A jobseeker's benefit payment was subsequently awarded from 12/3/2020.  According to records the person concerned withdrew his jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment on 10/6/2020.</p><p>If the person concerned feels he meets the eligibility criteria for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, it is open to him to make a further application, either through www.mywelfare.ie or at his local Intreo Centre in Bishop&rsquo;s Square. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

However, appeals work continues and appeals are currently being determined on the basis of written submissions.

According to the records of my Department, they have a total of 1,940 qualifying paid and credited Irish contributions which equates to a yearly average of 41 contributions.  This gives an entitlement to a standard State pension (contributory) at 98% of the maximum rate. They are also eligible for fuel allowance (payable during winter months), living alone increase and telephone support allowance. They were notified in writing of this decision and arrears due on 16 July 2020.</p>  <p>  Since the person concerned has had periods of employment in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands, their pension entitlement to a pro rata State pension (contributory) is under investigation, based on a combination of their Irish insurance record with their insurance records in other countries.  Upon receipt of the relevant information from the UK, Belgian and Dutch pension authorities, the person&rsquo;s pension entitlement will be reviewed and they will be notified in writing of the outcome.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Felling licences are now valid for up to 10 years and may cover several felling events, such as thinning then clear felling on the same plot.  Landowners considering future operations, have the opportunity of applying for a tree felling licence well in advance of any operations taking place. </p><p>I am acutely aware that delays in issuing licences has led to difficulties for some in the sector, although of course not all licence are used immediately.  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p><p>My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p><p>The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.</p><p>A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit applications that are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided. </p><p>I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come. </p><p>The table below shows applications for felling licences received and decisions issued in 2018, 2019 and to 30<sup>th</sup>June, 2020; the percentage decisions issued within and over four months; the average number of days to decision.  The objective under the Forestry Act 2014 is to issue a decision on a tree felling licence within four months. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications received</td>       <td>6,600</td>       <td>3,175</td>       <td>758</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Licences issued</td>       <td>3,603</td>       <td>4,098</td>       <td>823</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>% issued within four months</td>       <td>77%</td>       <td>71%</td>       <td>60%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>% issued over four months</td>       <td>23%</td>       <td>29%</td>       <td>40%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average days to decision*</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>185</td>       <td>215</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* For decisions made in the year indicated.</p><p>The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) is operationally independent of my Department.

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  Section 26 of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 establishes the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) as the controlling authority for the breeding of greyhounds in Ireland. All matings are registered with the ICC in addition to litter declarations. The Irish Greyhound Stud Book is statutorily maintained by the ICC. </p>  <p>  Pursuant to Article 3 of the Greyhound Industry (Racing) Regulations S.I. 302 of 2007, it is a requirement for a greyhound to be registered with the ICC before it can race at a Bord na gCon licensed track.

Article 11 of the Welfare of Greyhound Act, S.I. 29 of 2011, confines any breeder of a greyhound brood to 6 litters during the lifetime of the brood. Two additional litters are permissible under this legislation on the mandatory provision that a veterinary practitioner certifies with the ICC, that such breeding does not present a risk to the health or welfare of the brood. </p>  <p>  BnG has informed me that it is not aware of any breach of this legislative provision, nor has any been reported in the last two years  and accordingly BnG is not, nor has been involved, in any related investigatory activity.

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, and piers, lights and beacons constructed under the auspices of the Congested Districts Board.</p>  <p>  As a result, my legislative remit does not extend to Greencastle Harbour, and given that the ownership of, and overall responsibility for Greencastle Harbour rests with the County Council, it is the Council who will decide if it wishes to carry out any further development, repair or maintenance of Greencastle Harbour. </p>  <p>  My Department co-funded and project managed works on phase one of a larger Greencastle Harbour development programme up to 2011, which involved the construction of a rock breakwater. Phase one of this project was jointly funded by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Donegal County Council. The agreed funding breakdown was: 75% to be paid by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 12.5% to be paid by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and 12.5% to be paid by Donegal County Council.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;8.35m was provided by my Department for this project between the years 2006 &ndash; 2010. Funding for capital projects was, of necessity, significantly reduced due to the economic conditions prevalent in 2010. Funding of &euro;453,000 was provided for in my Department&rsquo;s 2011 capital programme to enable the Department to suspend the project in a safe and acceptable manner. In February 2012, my Department formally handed back responsibility for the Greencastle Harbour Project to Donegal County Council, following completion of works to safeguard the partially constructed breakwater. </p>  <p>  When Donegal County Council decide on the exact programme of works they wish to carry out, and the costing and timescale for those works, and notify their full intentions in this respect, the matter can be considered further in the context of Government priorities. </p>  <p>  My Department does provide limited funding to assist the 14 coastal Local Authorities in carrying out small scale projects for the development and repair of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways under the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  Since 2010, Donegal County Council has received funding of &euro; 3.1m under this programme.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;3.1m has been approved for the Local Authority element of my Department&rsquo;s 2020 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.  Donegal County Council has secured funding of &euro;433,500 under this programme, to undertake 7 Harbour Development and 4 Marine Leisure projects. Of this funding, &euro;90,000 has been allocated to repair works at Greencastle Harbour. </p></reply>

My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.   </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit applications that are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

The Bill will make it illegal for any new fur farms to be established and will put in place phase-out arrangements for the small number of current operators. This will allow for an orderly wind down of the sector and allow time for employees to find alternative opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 2020 contains a clear commitment regarding the prohibition of fur farming and Department officials are currently preparing the appropriate draft heads of a Bill to facilitate the achievement of this objective with a view to seeking Government authority at an early date.</p></reply>

It must be noted that prior to the commencement of the Forestry Act, 2014 on 24<sup>th</sup>May, 2017, consent for afforestation and forest road works was by way of <i>approval</i>rather than by <i>licence</i>.  The following tables provide the number of approvals/licences issued for the years 2015 to 30<sup>th</sup>June, 2020.  </p><p>I am acutely aware that delays in issuing licences has led to difficulties for some in the sector.  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p><p>My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. </p><p>The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p><p>A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p><p>I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come. <table>    <tr>       <th>Afforestation</th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>

Landowners considering future operations, have the opportunity of applying for a tree felling licence well in advance of any operations taking place. </p><p>I am acutely aware that delays in issuing licences has led to difficulties for some in the sector, although of course not all licence are used immediately.  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p><p>My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p><p>The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p><p>A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit applications that are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p><p>I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p><p>The table below shows data for applications for tree felling licences.  It should be noted that prior to the commencement of the Forestry Act, 2014 on 24<sup>th</sup>May, 2017, all tree felling licences were dealt with manually and age-related data are not available for all the years requested.

The Tie-up Scheme is a safety net scheme designed to assist active fishermen who consider that it is not economical to fish in the present market environment, by aiding them to tie-up their vessel for a one or two month period over June to August.  The Scheme provides participants with aid to cover the typical fixed costs of the vessel size concerned, complementing the income supports separately available from Government under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that aid is directed to active fishermen only, and bearing in mind that many smaller vessels in our fleet do not have vessel monitoring systems or EU Logbooks, a scheme requirement was introduced that applicants must have minimum sales of &euro;5,000 in 2019 recorded on the Sales Notes System operated by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  With some limited exceptions, sales of fish must, by law, be recorded on the Sales Notes System.  </p>  <p>  The day-to-day operation of the Sales Notes System, including compliance matters, is an operational matter for the SFPA and I am therefore precluded from involvement in this matter.</p></reply>

The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the combined total value of animal exports to the Irish economy was &euro;167 million.  The vast majority of animals moved are for trade within the EU.

Only ships approved by my Department can load cattle for export from Ireland.  Cattle being exported are monitored during the prescribed isolation period by Department Veterinary Inspectors and, in some cases, by Official Veterinarians from the importing countries. This is in addition to work carried out by Private Veterinary Practitioners who carry out the testing required prior to export to enable certification. Animals are inspected and certified by Official Veterinarians from the Department with regard to their health status and fitness for travel.  Due regard is taken to weather conditions in respect of long distance transport</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to work closely with other EU Member State and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. In this regard, Ireland has reaffirmed its on-going commitment to animal welfare through additional OIE multi-annual financial assistance (&euro;75,000 per annum over the period 2017-20) to support its activities directed towards enhancing animal welfare worldwide.</p></reply>

For this reason, the application was referred to my Department&rsquo;s Ecology Unit for their assessment. </p>  <p>  There are currently delays to issuing decisions on forestry licence applications, which are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).

These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p>  <p>  One aspect of this plan is prioritising applications where the applicant has submitted a Natura Impact Statement (NIS).

In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report 2018/2019, the staff turnover rate stood at 23% which, despite a 2% improvement on the previous year, is unsustainably high.</p>  <p>  I believe that the key challenge to recruiting and retaining staff is the attractiveness of working in the sector. One way to address this issue is through improving wages and working conditions. The increases in investment in recent years need to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to support the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee in the childcare sector and the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order, which would determine minimum rates of pay for childcare workers, as well as terms and conditions of employment. Officials in my Department are liaising with officials in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to the implications of the recent High Court decision on Sectoral Employment Orders and any implications this decision may have. </p>  <p>  My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families. First 5 recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. First 5 includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce.</p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, an expert group has been appointed to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. </p>  <p>  First 5 also includes a commitment to a Workforce Development Plan for the early learning and care and school age childcare sectors which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. Work on developing the Workforce Development Plan began last year and is on-going. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-21a.1477.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100094#WRBB04300"><p>Officials in my Department have been monitoring closely developments in relation to early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC) sectoral capacity, including the supply of, and demand for, places as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Supporting services as they reopen, and ensuring that capacity is sufficient to meet demand, is a key priority of my Department. </p><p>The Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2019 demonstrated that, prior to the disruption caused by COVID-19, the sector was running at near capacity. However, recent IPSOS/MRBI surveys of parents commissioned by my Department indicate a drop in the number of families likely to seek to access ELC and SAC in the initial weeks of reopening. </p><p>Expert guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May. The guidance recommends, amongst other measures, the use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model to restrict interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. The public health advice does not require any change to minimum adult-child ratios or to regulatory space requirements. While some settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout, there are no absolute requirements for capacity reduction, and most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in capacity. </p><p>On 10 June 2020, my Department announced a major funding package to facilitate the reopening of ELC and SAC services. In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services resumed from 29 June. To this end, the Government has committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. </p><p>The funding package contains four significant elements: </p><p>- A once-off Reopening Support Payment (RSP) for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p><p>- A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p><p>- Continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) </p><p>- Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. </p><p>In developing the funding package, it is recognised that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This funding package is tailored to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the increased costs associated with complying with public health requirements in a lower occupancy scenario.</p><p>The funding package will also help to ensure that ELC and SAC providers do not charge higher fees over the summer than they did pre-COVID-19. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.</p><p>A key policy priority for the Department in this process is the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector and hence it has and continues to work intensively to support services to reopen after COVID-19. The reopening funding aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p><p>The latest data shows that 85% of services that ordinarily operate in July and August have now reopened.</p><p>Officials in the Department are now working on supports for the sector going forward. This will reflect the continued commitment to quality, affordable, accessible ELC and SAC, and will recognise the importance of having a sustainable sector, in the interests of providers, practitioners, parents, children and economic recovery. Department officials are working closely with eight representative organisations of the sector through the Advisory Group on Reopening.</p><p>As of 15 July 2020, Tusla had been notified of 81 closures of services since January 2020. These are outlined as below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Type of Service</b></th>       <th><b>No. of Services</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Full Day </td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Part Time</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Childminding </td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sessional</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drop in</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>81</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2019, 200 services closed and approximately 150 services closed in both 2017 and 2018. Services which close tend to be replaced with new services, or existing services expand to absorb their capacity. The number of childcare places in the sector has grown by approximately 60% over the last 5 years. The average size of childcare service has grown from 33 to 47. </p><p>State investment to the sector has increased by 141% over the last five budgets. The Government is committed to implementing <i>First 5: A Whole-of- Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families</i>, which commits to at least doubling investment in Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare in the decade to 2028. </p><p>The Programme for Government reaffirms the importance of reforming the ELC and SAC sector and this remains a priority for the Department over the coming year. </p></reply>

The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. Based on advice provided by the HPSC, the Regulations in relation to the adult-child ratios and the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services have not been amended as such changes are unnecessary where "play pods" are in use. Therefore additional staff are not required to meet adult child ratios for any age group. </p>  <p>  While some settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout, there are no required capacity reductions, and most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in capacity. In addition, the use of play-pods and the fact that the Regulations in relation to the adult-child ratios and floor-space requirements have not changed mean that the costs of compliance with public health requirements have been kept to a minimum.</p>  <p>  By 17 July, of 1,800 ELC and SAC services open last summer, approximately 1,400 services had registered at least one child on a funding scheme run by my Department. As not all children access places supported through these schemes, and as providers can continue to register children on schemes over the coming days and weeks, this indicates a very high level of reopening. </p></reply>

The HPSC guidance sets out the steps to be taken by childcare services where a child is suspected of having symptoms of Covid-19 while in the service i.e. the child should be isolated from other children, their parent/s should be contacted and asked to collect them and the parent should be advised to contact their GP. The guidance is also clear that parents should be advised to not bring children to the service if they have symptoms of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The HPSC guidance does not require services to seek a medical certificate for children suspected of having Covid-19 in order for the child to return to the service. Officials in my Department have become aware of some confusion about this among services.  The HPSC guidance is currently being updated to provide further clarity on this matter.</p>  <p>  Following engagement with General Practitioners the HPSC have advised that requiring assurances/certification from medical practitioners prior to attendance at childcare or prior to return to childcare after an absence is not appropriate as it places unnecessary demand on the healthcare system and there is no reason to expect it to increase the safety of childcare services. Any process of medical certification in this context will, of necessity, relate to the child&rsquo;s condition one or more days before attendance for childcare and the child&rsquo;s condition may have changed in the interim.  </p></reply>

The Government envisages that Childcare Ireland will assist in expanding high quality childcare, best practice and innovation in community and private childcare settings.</p>  <p>  In 'First Five, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families', published in November 2018, my Department committed to complete a review of the operating model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) in this country.</p>  <p>  The existing operating model operates across many levels, and includes organisations such as Pobal, 30 City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs), and 7 National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs) which are funded by my Department to carry out a range of administrative, operational, communications, and quality improvement and training functions in relation to ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of the proposed review is to ensure the operating system is equipped to implement Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) policy to the standards required. It is hoped that the final system will support high quality, accessible and affordable ELC and SAC services to children and families through the efficient and effective administration of a number of programmes, schemes, quality initiatives, and other functions such a compliance and communications. The operating model resulting from the review should better support service providers, operate transparently and accountably, provide value for money to the Exchequer and demonstrate good governance. The model would enable appropriate linkages and effective working relationships with all other agencies and Departments charged with delivering better outcomes for children and families. </p>  <p>  My Department hopes to begin work on the review shortly and will engage with all relevant stakeholders during the process. It is envisaged that the analysis carried out through the review will ultimately provide a robust evidence base to inform a decision by Government on how best to establish Childcare Ireland.</p></reply>

The HPSC guidance clearly states that parents should be advised not to bring their child to the service if they are displaying any of the symptoms of Covid-19 (including high temperature, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing). In line with HSE guidance, any individual displaying symptoms of Covid-19 should self-isolate immediately and contact their GP. The GP will advise them as to whether testing is required and what steps they should take, including if and when a child may return to an early learning and care or school-age childcare service.</p>  <p>  The HPSC guidance also sets out the steps to be taken by childcare services where a child is suspected of having symptoms of Covid-19 (such as a high temperature) while in the service i.e. the child should be isolated from other children, their parent/s should be contacted and asked to collect them and the parent should be advised to contact their GP for further advice. If the child tests positive for Covid-19 the local public health department will make contact with the service and with any close contacts in order to advise them on what steps they need to take.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services resumed from 29 June. I am pleased that Government committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. </p>  <p>  The initial reopening funding package aimed to support providers in the initial phase of reopening (from 29 June to 23 August), staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p>  <p>  I am now working intensively on a funding package to support the sector for the period beyond 24 August and for the remainder of the year. My officials are working closely with representatives of the sector through the Advisory Group on Reopening to develop an effective and efficient support package, which will be communicated at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a number of supports were available before the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available now. The Department oversees a Case Management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services experiencing difficulties. Financial supports, which are also accessed through Case Management, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p></reply>

The period in which Parent&rsquo;s Leave can be taken will also be extended from one year to two years.  This, and related costs, will be considered as part of the Budget 2021 process.  The support is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week.</p>  <p>  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. </p></reply>

I am advised that the Hamilton Review Group is currently finalising the draft report with a view to its publication in the coming weeks (Quarter 3 2020). </p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant number of bodies have key responsibilities to develop and implement anti-corruption policies, with the competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other bodies with a mandate to tackle corruption.  </p>  <p>  These include, inter alia, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission, local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Anti-Corruption Unit in the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee, other Oireachtas committees, regulators, Government Departments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and tribunals of enquiry and commissions of investigation.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has an extensive range of legislative provisions to prevent and combat corruption. These include the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, Freedom of Information Act 2014 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. </p>  <p>  In relation to recent legislative developments, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 was commenced in full on the 30 July 2018. The Act repealed and replaced the seven previous Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010. The Act is not merely a consolidation of the old provisions. It strengthens and clarifies the law in relation to corruption. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also a party to a number of anti-corruption international instruments.  These are the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).  As such, Ireland is subject to regular peer evaluations associated with the implementation of these international agreements with recommendations for improvement made following each review.  </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, 28 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;666,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, last year my predecessor as Minister expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>In relation to the applications from both Littleton and Fethard referred to by the Deputy, I am informed that the application for a Community Based Scheme under Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na Act, 2005, has not met the standard to be heard at the CCTV Advisory Committee (which makes recommendations to the Garda Commissioner) due to issues in respect of the location of the server. It had been proposed that the server would be based in the local Garda Station and that the local Superintendent would act as Data Controller. This is at variance with S.I. 289/06 which stipulates that the Local Authority will act as Data Controller. This has been communicated back to the applicant group and I understand that a reply is awaited on any alternative proposal for siting of the server.</p><p>In relation to the application from Clonmel, I am further informed that there was some confusion regarding the application for the Clonmel scheme as the application was forwarded as a Section 38(3)(c) scheme &ndash; i.e., a Community Based CCTV Scheme &ndash; but the papers submitted propose an extension to an existing scheme which is in fact a Section 38(3)(a) scheme - a Garda scheme as opposed to a Community scheme. I understand that An Garda Sioch&aacute;na are now processing this application as a Garda Scheme extension.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of other groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p></reply>

We are cooperating with partners and are actively engaged in the work of multilateral international organisations who are addressing human trafficking, including the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and the European Union.</p>  <p>  Ireland has ratified the principal international Human Trafficking treaties, namely the Palermo Protocol (2000) to the UN Convention against Organised Crime; and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005). Ireland has also ratified the ILO Forced Labour Protocol, which reinforces the international legal framework for combating all forms of forced labour, including trafficking in persons. This initiative put Ireland among the group known as &ldquo;50 for Freedom&rdquo;, which stems from an ILO initiative to encourage member countries to ratify the Protocol by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  The EU Anti Trafficking Directive (2011/36/EU) and in Ireland, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 are the relevant legislative measures here and the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking was launched in 2016. This involves a victim-centred and human rights based approach with the ultimate aims of preventing human trafficking, ensuring an effective criminal justice response and delivery of supports to victims.</p>  <p>  There is a specialised Garda Unit - the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit &ndash; to address this form of criminality and a High Level Group involving the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of the DPP and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in place which keeps the legislative and operational framework for investigation and prosecution of trafficking under review.</p>  <p>  A number of partners across the public service provide care and practical support to victims of trafficking including the HSE, the Legal Aid Board, the Immigration Service and Tusla.  The Department of Justice and Equality also provides funding to NGOs for their work to provide support to victims of trafficking.  Other measures currently being taken include training of Garda&iacute; and immigration officers and awareness raising initiatives which are crucial to early detection of this crime.</p>  <p>  Addressing human trafficking is an ongoing challenge and a number of other key actions are currently planned or due to begin in the near future. In particular:</p>  <p>  - The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) is to be designated as Ireland&rsquo;s independent National Rapporteur for Anti-Human Trafficking under article 19 of the EU Human Trafficking Directive. Legislation is currently being drafted to make this designation;</p>  <p>  - The review of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which criminalised the purchase of sex as part of a wider approach to protection of persons trafficked into prostitution, has been launched;</p>  <p>  - There is ongoing engagement by the Department of Justice and Equality with NGOs to identify solutions to the provision of accommodation to victims of trafficking, particularly female victims of sexual exploitation;</p>  <p>  - The Department has established a forum for victims and stakeholders in relation to human trafficking, which had its first meeting earlier this month and which will examine the need to update the existing National Action Plan on Human Trafficking, including to respond to the commitment in the Programme for Government to adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy to combat trafficking of women and girls;</p>  <p>  - The Forum will also work with the Department in a review of the National Referral Mechanism in Ireland, learning from best practice models in other EU Member States; and</p>  <p>  - Legislation is being drafted to strengthen the penal framework on people smuggling, thereby implementing three international legal instruments in the area.</p>  <p>  My Department is closely studying the report and recommendations included in the US State Department &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons&rsquo; (TiPs) Report 2020.  Ireland maintains in close ongoing contact with the United States on this issue and the report will feed into the Department&rsquo;s ongoing work on the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking.</p></reply>

A range of measures for pet safety, recommended by the National Crime Prevention Unit, can be found on the Garda website at <i></i>.</p><p>I am further informed by the Courts Service that the ability to pull together data in response to the Deputy's question is dependent upon being able to isolate animal theft in their records over any other type of theft.  For other offences, this is possible because the offence type has a specific code on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's PULSE system, which the Courts Service use for populating their own records.</p><p>I understand that there is no specific code on PULSE for theft of animals. The same code is used for all types of theft and it would require the checking of individual records within the Courts Service to separate out theft of animals from other types of theft.  Given the numbers of offences of theft every year, this is too onerous a task to narrow down over the three year period the Deputy has requested.</p></reply>

I understand that the other cell blocks at Portlaoise already have in-cell sanitation in place.</p>  <p>  I am informed that it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the cost involved in provision of in-cell sanitation for the E block at Portlaoise at this time, pending the completion of the feasibility study and the preparation of a scope of works on the work to be undertaken, completion of necessary engineering surveys, which are required for the preparation of an estimate of costs.  The Deputy may however be interested to know that I am informed by the IPS that it is hoped an invitation to tender for necessary works will be issued to the market in the first quarter of 2021, subject to funding.</p>  <p>  When completed, this work and the redevelopment of Limerick Prison, which is currently in progress,  will see the full elimination of slopping in the prison estate. The Deputy may be interested to know that the total budget for the overall Limerick project is &euro;71.5million.  I understand that the contract for the construction of these works was awarded in February 2019 and that the project is currently scheduled for completion in the last quarter of 2021.</p></reply>

Indeed, officials of my Department, the Prison Service and other agencies participated in key stakeholder interviews for the purposes of the Report.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, every State has a duty to protect its borders and to refuse entry to those persons not entitled to enter the State. This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration.  The exercise of powers in this area is subject to the law and respect for individual rights.</p>  <p>  Detention in a Garda Station or prison of a person refused entry to the State is undertaken as a last resort. Indeed, there is a statutory obligation to return a person refused entry permission as soon as is practicable. Most persons are returned on the same day that they are refused entry.</p>  <p>  A refusal of leave to land by the Border Management Unit is always signed off by a more senior civil servant.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a refusal of leave to land, unlike a deportation or a removal order, does not prevent the person from seeking to enter the State in the future if they satisfy the conditions for entry. The principle of non-refoulement applies to these decisions.</p>  <p>  The relevant provisions on immigration related detention are kept under ongoing review and the recommendations in this Report will be considered in that context.</p></reply>

It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of the persons who have actually received the above penalties, as there is no specific code on PULSE for the possession of a stolen animal.

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.</p>  <p>  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  During the response to COVID-19, Nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA, who under the Health Act 2007 have the legal authority to examine the operation of any facility under their remit.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular nursing home, I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy and has forwarded on details to HIQA as the statutory regulator for nursing homes, and the HSE for appropriate action and follow up.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19-related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide the Deputy with a direct response.</p></reply>

A well organised screening programme, when combined with HPV vaccination for boys and girls, will help to achieve that goal. The Programme for Government commits to supporting the CervicalCheck Screening Programme and promoting the uptake of the HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of secondary school. The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys. This started in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  </p>  <p>  In relation to cancer screening, CervicalCheck made the technical transition to HPV cervical screening on 30 March. This means that any test taken after this date is an HPV cervical screening test with follow-up cytology if required. The move to HPV Cervical Screening means that Ireland joins a small group of nations that employs the best-in-class testing to screen their populations for cervical cancer.  Other countries include Australia, England, the Netherlands and Wales. This improved testing methodology, along with the continued roll-out of HPV vaccinations, means that Ireland can look forward to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer cases over the next 10-20 years.</p></reply>

This is because young children may not follow advice about wearing a mask correctly and avoiding touching it.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure and should not take the place of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and other personal protective public health measures. Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. </p><p>From 29 June 2020, as part of Phase 3 of the Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business, a wide range of businesses and services can now open or recommence including summer camps and dance schools. See  for further information. Organisers of any such activities are advised to consult the latest public health advice, available on the websites below, which are updated on a regular basis:</p><p>-  </p><p>-  </p><p>Public health advice regarding children is available at  </p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has developed Guidance for Youth Organisations on Resuming Full Services after COVID-19 which is available at the following link:  </p><p>You may also wish to note that during Phase 3 indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 200 people when conducted in line with public health advice are permissible. </p><p>The Return to Work Safely Protocol, published by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, may apply in circumstances involving summer camps.  It provides detailed guidance which was developed to assist employers and employees in the coming period. The protocol is available at . The Protocol is mandatory and it applies to all workplaces right across the economy.  Specific sectors may need to introduce additional safeguards, but this document sets the standard set of measures required in every workplace.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving. I can assure you that the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the NPHET has also been proactively examining all relevant evidence relating to the virus and the issue of face coverings. The EAG has requested the Health Information and Quality Authority to prepare a revised and updated evidence synthesis on face coverings and I have been informed that this paper is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>The latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:</p><p>- </p><p>-</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-21a.1862.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072100101#WRJJ00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 672, 674 and 711 together.</p>  <p>  I note the recent publication in England of the report of the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) review, &ldquo;First Do No Harm&rdquo; which was chaired by Baroness Cumberlege.  </p>  <p>  International evidence and learning play an important role in health policy considerations to promote safe, high quality care for patients. This report may add to that evidence and learning.</p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the CMO report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. </p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications. </p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.  </p></reply>

It is important to note that the number of cases of TB in Ireland is low. A total of ten cases were reported in the 0-14 age group in 2019.</p>  <p>  As of 2015, most European countries did not give the BCG vaccine routinely to all babies (Dierig et al, Vaccine, 2015).</p>  <p>  In April 2015, due to a lack of vaccine from the sole EU supplier, the BCG vaccine became unavailable in Ireland. In 2015, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended that the BCG vaccine does not need to be given to all children in Ireland. The Heath Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) published a Health Technology Assessment of BCG vaccine in Ireland in December 2015. This also concluded that BCG vaccination does not need to be given to all children in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE were requested, in 2019, to undertake an updated review of the epidemiology of TB in Ireland, considering the public health impact of having no BCG vaccination since April 2015. The intention is that this review will be used to inform an updated recommendation to my Department regarding the future provision of BCG vaccination in Ireland. Once the recommendation to my Department is received and considered, my Department will issue an instruction to the HSE on the future provision of BCG vaccination in Ireland.</p></reply>

The level of costs incurred by graduate entry students has also been highlighted in consultations with the NCHDs who have qualified through this route. Unfortunately the Minister for Finance was not in a position at the time to accede to the proposal. Given the manner in which NCHDs undertake their training and often further training abroad post qualification, the proposal that bursaries would be given in return for future clinical years would be challenging to implement.</p><p>In Ireland, the development of a <i>National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning</i>in 2017 marked an important milestone in developing a more robust and systematic workforce planning approach. A range of policies and programmes are being implemented to support the recruitment, retention and development of key parts of the health workforce, including for example the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures (MacCraith Report) and the draft Policy on Graduate, Specialist and Advanced Nursing and Midwifery Practice.</p><p>The HSE People Strategy 2015&ndash;2018 has also delivered a comprehensive suite of initiatives designed to engage, develop and support the workforce to deliver the best possible care and services to people who depend on them. </p><p>The new Programme for Government <i>Our Shared Future</i>commits to establishing a Workforce Planning Expert Unit to work with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.

The guidance which is published and available on the HSPC's website advises that indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will be permissible from 15th of June in circumstances where certain criteria are followed. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff.</p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult the restrictions on visiting have been for both nursing home residents and their families. Therefore, this phased approach is much welcomed as it will both facilitate visits to loved ones across the country, whilst also keeping some of our most vulnerable members of society protected during this challenging time.</p></reply>

Therefore community pharmacists play a vital role in the Irish Health Service in the delivery of holistic patient care. I also fully acknowledge that community pharmacy has played a pivotal role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. It is recognised that community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate the worries and concerns of the population around continuity of medicine supply in the face of great uncertainty.</p>  <p>  This has been a period of unprecedented difficulty for the country and pharmacists have been at the forefront of the response. Accordingly, commitment has been given to commence a strategic review of the role of community pharmacists and to engage with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to develop revised contractual terms. On 5 December 2019, my predecessor met with the Irish Pharmacy Union and communicated this intention. </p>  <p>  The existing GMS pharmacy contract dates from 1996 and it is accepted that it is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training. </p>  <p>  The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes. </p>  <p>  There has continued to be regular engagement with the IPU throughout the past number of months and a significant number of contingency measures have been put in place under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Amendment Regulations, 2020, intended to relieve the pressures on community pharmacies and General Practitioners during the COVID-19 crisis. </p></reply>

The policy was developed at a time when specialist palliative care was at a relatively early stage of development in Ireland and emphasises the structures and staffing required for specialist palliative care services in hospices, acute hospitals and the community.  Notwithstanding its longevity, our national policy on palliative care continues to be highly regarded internationally.  The 2015 Quality of Death Index report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which measures the current environment for end-of- life care services across 40 countries, ranked Ireland fourth in the world.</p>  <p>  Demand for adult palliative care has greatly increased since 2001. Around 30,000 people in Ireland die each year.  CSO mortality projections suggest there will be about 38,000 deaths in Ireland in 2031, rising to 54,000 per year by 2050.  Due to our aging population and as more people with life-limiting illnesses live longer,  our country faces the challenge of ensuring high quality palliative care is available to increasing numbers of people with life-limiting conditions, in all settings.  Against this background, the Programme for Government commits to publish a new Palliative Care Policy for Adults by mid-2021 to update the 2001 policy. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government,  it is intended to open new hospices in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow this year and expand an existing service in Kildare, which will see an additional 55 new beds coming on stream.  In the coming years, the Government is committed to progressing the development of a further three hospices, in the midlands, Cavan and Drogheda.  When these developments are in place, there will be a hospice serving every region in the country.</p>  <p>  Ensuring children with life-limiting conditions can access palliative care services to help them have a good quality of life is very important to me as Minister for Health.  In this regard, I welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase resources for the Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care Programme. This will be supported by consultants with a special interest in children&rsquo;s palliative care and children&rsquo;s outreach nurses to coordinate care for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.</p></reply>

The number of consultants has increased consistently in recent years and the Government is committed to continuing to increase consultant capacity.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2020, in line with the continued rollout of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan, funding of &euro;10 million in 2020 and &euro;60 million in 2021 is being invested in the enhancement of Community Services. The additional full year funding will provide for up to 1,000 therapists, nurses, other health professionals in the community and the recruitment of dementia advisers. </p>  <p>  This involves working towards the appointment of up to 1,000 additional staff across a range of disciplines and deploying these in teams that will focus in the first instance on managing older people with complex needs/chronic conditions and shifting care away from the acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health issued a request to the HSE to provide a business case for the Enhanced Community Care Fund in late 2019 for the recruitment of the additional 1,000 staff, the services to which they would be assigned and the outcomes they will deliver.</p>  <p>  An extensive document was submitted by the HSE shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland, setting out a model for a reformed approach to primary and community care.  By agreement with HSE and Department of Health colleagues, the detailed response was issued in June 2020 to allow all focus to be appropriately placed on the COVID-19 pandemic emergency response. As we move towards service recovery, it is intended to finalise the Enhanced Community Care business case to ensure that recruitment of staff can be in place before year-end.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government also commits to continue to implement the nursing agreement which includes measures to support recruitment and retention of nurses, including the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix. The Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Adult Hospitals in Ireland is an evidence-based methodology to determine the nurse staffing and skill mix range required in our hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Framework was developed in the Department of Health and piloted in three sites before it was formally launched by my colleague Minister Harris in April 2018. Results from the pilot were positive for both patients and staff, showing evidence of improvements in the quality of care and patient outcomes, and a reduction in length of stay. The Framework also stabilised the workforce, improving staff moral and leading to a reduction in agency spend.</p>  <p>  The national rollout of the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings is now the responsibility of the HSE and a National Implementation structure has been agreed. Full national rollout has commenced and is starting in the model 4 hospitals.</p>  <p>  For the most recent update we refer the deputy to HSE as they are responsible for the rollout of Phase 1.  In relation to Phase 2 (emergency care setting), the pilot testing is ongoing with the first report due by the end of July. Once approved and published national roll out of this phase will begin, stabilising the workforce further. Phase 3 (non-acute care setting) is still in the early stages of development with the evidence review in progress. </p>  <p>  Since the health service began managing the current pandemic several recruitment initiatives have taken place to maximise and support the workforce.  However, it remains difficult to quantify the public health sector workforce requirements post Covid-19 while the impacts of the crisis on both staffing levels and resources are ongoing. </p>  <p>  Although GPs are private contractors and not employed by the HSE, I am also concerned to ensure that the number of GPs will increase, and several efforts have been undertaken to this end. The yearly number of GPs entering training has increased steadily, rising from 120 in 2009 to 208 this year. The target for next year is 230 places. In addition, the 2019 GP Agreement for service modernisation and contractual reform will see the Government increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) by 2023, increasing fees for participating GPs and improving maternity and paternity leave arrangements, making general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  The Rare Disease Plan is now firmly embedded in the work of the HSE Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. This programme is now under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer.</p>  <p>  Meetings, to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases take place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  </p>  <p>  A number of key themes have now been identified for progression in the coming period, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy. This will form the basis for work in this area in the time ahead.</p></reply>

The value of eHealth became apparent during the COVID crisis, as technologies were quickly deployed at scale to remove the risk of a surge to acute hospitals, to support new pathways of care and to help reduce the risk of infection to clinicians and patients.   </p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 response, new eHealth solutions were deployed to provide secure electronic transfer of prescriptions from GP surgeries to pharmacies, reducing the risk of potential exposure for the public and health workers, by removing the need to attend surgeries for some prescriptions and reducing waiting times in community pharmacies. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be familiar with the smartphone Contact Tracing App which has been developed by the HSE, enhancing manual contact tracing, informing of the spread of Covid-19 symptoms nationally and providing a publicly trusted source of Covid-19 related news, information and guidance.  The App runs on Apple and Android phones and has been developed in line with EU guidelines. Adoption of the app is entirely voluntary and the use of all functions is consent based.  Within 48 hours over 1 million people had downloaded the app and signed up as registered users. Electronic transfer of prescriptions has proven hugely successful, very convenient and avoids the need for otherwise well patients to attend GP surgeries, reducing risk to them, GPs and practice staff. The depeloyment of telehealth solutions has been accelerated over the past three months and has emerged as a significant eHealth benefit in response to Covid. These are just a few of the eHealth digital supports that were introduced during the pandemic that will continue to be developed and improved with a view to embedding these technologies in healthcare settings.  </p>  <p>  A unique, individual health identifier (IHI) is required to enable clinical systems to communicate with each other, in the knowledge that they are dealing with the same patient and sharing of data across the various medical settings where patients seek treatment.  In parallel with building on digital advances made during the COVID emergency, planned developments will include the roll-out of the IHI for health care facilities and healthcare practitioners, the embedding of Eircodes into healthcare systems and the implementation of an electronic health record for the new children's hospital which is currently at procurement stage.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a continuing programme of work is in place by the HSE to upgrade and install ICT infrastructure in locations nationwide in multiple health settings. </p></reply>

This mandatory requirement for open disclosure will ensure that patients and their families receive appropriate timely information in relation to an incident that may have occurred in relation to their care.  </p><p>The <i>Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019</i>will also bring the private hospitals within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The relevant provisions extend the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, allowing it to set standards for the operation of private hospitals, to monitor compliance with them and to undertake inspections and investigations as required. The Bill also contains provisions to support clinical audit within the health service.</p><p>The Bill was introduced into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 12 December 2019 and passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is due to go to D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  The Bill is a Programme for Government commitment and it is my intention is to restore the Bill to the order paper.  Following D&aacute;il Committee stage, the Bill will be progressed to D&aacute;il Report Stage and will then go through all Stages in the  Seanad. </p><p>The <i>Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019</i>is also part of the broader programme of legislative and policy initiatives to improve the ability of the health service to anticipate, identify, respond to patient safety issues and improve the quality and safety of health services for patients. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support.</p>  <p>  As part of this, work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  Work undertaken in 2019 focussed on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation, and a review of existing services.  In 2020, it had been intended to focus on piloting a reformed model of service delivery for home support services, the development of the evidence base for the financing of home support services; and the development of a framework for the regulation of these services. </p>  <p>  While Sl&aacute;intecare commits to the establishment of the scheme by the end of 2021, progress on the development of the scheme, including the planned testing of a pilot scheme in 2020, has been impacted by the ongoing work and diversion of resources as part of the response to COVID-19.  However, my Department remains committed to bringing forward this work as a priority, taking on  board the learning from the response to COVID-19, in order to support people to age well and continue to live independently in their homes for as long as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>In regard to the information requested by the Deputy concerning Tilt Table Tests at Sligo University Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide you with a direct response.</p></reply>

Under the Strategy, cancer survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and continues until end of life.  The National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) estimated that there were 173,000 cancer survivors in Ireland in 2016. The total survivors is expected to continue to grow due to our increasing and ageing population, and to improvements in patient outcomes.  Net five-year survivorship for all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) increased from 42% (1994-1999) to 62% (2011-2015), with five-year survivorship for many cancers now above 80%.  It is expected that this trend will continue.</p>  <p>  Neither the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme nor the NCRI collect information on the number of cancer patients who finish active treatment. This is as many cancer survivors require life-long, evidenced-based health care, whether preventive, general medical, psychosocial or care specific to their cancer diagnosis, meaning that their care can continue long after their primary treatment.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020.

This report may add to that evidence and learning.</p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the CMO report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals. </p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications.</p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. </p></reply>

The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support nursing homes and their residents have evolved on foot of epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide as well as focused specifically on residential facilities.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government's Roadmap for the re-opening of Society and Business, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has agreed that a phased approach to the recommencement of visiting to long term residential centres would be appropriate at this time.</p>  <p>  In light of the above , and on the basis that the COVID-19 disease status in the country remains in its current stable condition, the NPHET recommended that from 15th of June, the phased resumption of indoor visiting of residents in residential care facilities may commence in accordance with guidance issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). The guidance which is published and available on the HSPC's website advises that indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is presently permissible certain criteria are followed, including limiting the time associated with visits. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff. The various criteria are in place having regard to the public health advice.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the impact of COVID-19 on society in general and especially those living in nursing homes has been considerable. Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction.</p>  <p>  Visitor guidance is being further refined by the HPSC at present and it is anticipated that updated guidance will be available shortly, once the refinement is complete. This guidance is under constant review, balancing risks with benefit in line with the disease trajectory in the community.</p></reply>

The assessment should consider the risk factors for getting COVID-19, that is Distance, Activity, Time and Environment, and include controls such as managed entry, improved hygiene facilities, and regular cleaning to limit these factors.

Social distancing of 2 metres is also recommended wherever possible.

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. I do not have plans to establish a distribution scheme for face coverings. They are readily available in retail outlets and online. Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie/facecoverings and the HSE website.</p><p>On 15 June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign  which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:</p><p>- who should wear face coverings</p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19) (Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering.</p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:</p><p>- cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress</p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating</p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person</p><p>- removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury</p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication</p><p>The Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years. It is a matter for the person using the transport service to demonstrate that they have a reasonable excuse.</p><p>The Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public. Work on the development of relevant Regulations has commenced and it is likely that similar &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; provisions will apply.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving. I can assure the Deputy that the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the NPHET has also been proactively examining all relevant evidence relating to the virus and the issue of face coverings.

Interrupting transmission of the COVID-19 virus is the main goal of public health measures and it is clear from our experience that the scale of effect of interruption of transmission is influenced by a number of factors.  The most important way to protect our older population, whether living at home or in a long-term residential care (LTRC) setting, has been to reduce the amount of disease present in our community. The transmission of the virus, particularly in respect of LTRC settings is multifactorial and its introduction into any setting could be the result of a number of factors.</p>  <p>   As a new disease, health authorities across the world are learning about COVID-19 and adapting as new evidence and understanding is formed. The HSE in line with all health authorities continuously reviews emerging evidence and guidance.  This is evident from the significant package of guidance that has been produced and has continued to be developed and updated in line with new national and international evidence and data.</p>  <p>  The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support long-term residential care facilities and their residents have evolved on foot of epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide as well as focused specifically on residential facilities. Advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) focused on all long-term residential care settings and its recommended actions were relevant for all residential care services - older people, disability and mental health settings.</p>  <p>  As some aspects of the Deputy's questions are operational matters I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  During the response to COVID-19, Nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA, who under the Health Act 2007 have the legal authority to examine the operation of any facility under their remit.</p>  <p>  Furthermore on foot of a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendation, on 23rd May a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes was established, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Panel is to examine the national and international responses to the COVID-19 crisis, and to examine the emerging best practice. Its main objective is to provide immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the next 12-18 months. COVID-19 is a new disease, which can present atypically in the frail elderly, and new evidence and best practice in its management are constantly emerging. I expect the Expert Panel to submit their final report to me later this month.</p></reply>

There are a multitude of reasons why a medicine may not be available including: shortages of raw materials; manufacturing difficulties; or product recalls due to potential quality issues.</p>  <p>  Medicine shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicine shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicine shortage framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p>  <p>  In many instances a shortage of a particular medicine is effectively addressed to ensure continuity of care for a patient including through the substitution for a generic version (in the case of a branded medicine short supply) or a generic version from a different manufacturer (in the case of a generic medicine in short supply). Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 medicines which are deemed to be interchangeable can be directly substituted for one another by a pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Where an interchangeable product is not available in Ireland, a pharmacist, in consultation with the prescriber, can source a medicine containing the same active ingredient in order to ensure that continuity of patient care is maintained, wherever possible. Such medicines may be sourced in another European Member State, or by a specialist wholesaler in a third country, and are known as exempt medicinal products (EMPs). EMPs have not been granted a marketing authorisation in Ireland by the HPRA but are sourced in response to a bona fide unsolicited order in order to fulfil the special needs of a patient. These medicines will however have undergone an evaluation of their safety, quality, and efficacy for the granting of their marketing authorisation in another EU Member State or third country by the respective competent authority for medicines.</p>  <p>  In other instances, where a medicine shortage occurs due to a more global issue affecting multiple countries, a patient may be directed to return to their clinician to consider prescribing an alternative medicine for the treatment of their condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE maintains a reimbursement list of medicines that are provided under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS). These products are approved for the schemes by the HSE. In some cases, an alternative product sourced to maintain continuity of care in the event of a medicine shortage may be more expensive than the original medicine prescribed and will not ordinarily be included in the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  However, GMS medical card holders can apply to the local HSE health office to have these costs covered under the discretionary hardship arrangements. Under the DPS an individual or family will pay no more than &euro;124 each calendar month for approved prescribed medicines. In certain cases, the cost of EMPs can be included in the total costs of medicines up to the threshold of &euro;124. Patients are advised to consult with their pharmacist or clinician, who can make an application under the discretionary hardship arrangements on their behalf or to have the product covered by the relevant scheme.</p>  <p>  Patients or their carers who have any concerns in relation to temporary alternative products provided because of medicine shortages are advised to speak with their pharmacist or other healthcare professional involved in their care.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide the Deputy with a direct response.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy may wish to note that individual businesses and organisations are free to introduce an e-cigarette free policy if they choose to, and many have, including public transport providers and local authorities.</p><p>E-cigarettes are not regulated under the workplace smoking ban which was introduced on the basis of clear and unequivocal evidence that second hand smoke is harmful to non-smokers. That evidence base is still being developed in relation to the aerosol generated from e-cigarettes. In March of this year, the Health Research Board began a review of the evidence on the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. The evidence review is expected to be completed in<b></b>the Autumn<b></b>and it will contribute to informing any future regulation in this area.</p><p>In October 2019 the Government approved the drafting of legislation for a Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which will prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to persons under 18. In addition the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to curb the advertising of nicotine inhaling products near schools, on public transport and in cinemas.</p></reply>

The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support nursing homes and their residents have evolved on foot of epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide as well as focused specifically on residential facilities.</p><p>It is recognised that the impact of COVID-19 on society in general and especially those living in nursing homes has been considerable. Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the wellbeing of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon in to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p><p>As the disease is becoming more suppressed in the community the National Public Health Emergency has advised that the gradual reintroduction of usual activities while taking public health precautions should commence. This advice is reflected in the latest Cocooning and visiting guidance. Detail of this guidance is set out by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) at: .</p><p>In line with the Government's Roadmap for the re-opening of Society and Business, the National Public Health Emergency Team has agreed that a phased approach to the recommencement of visiting to long term residential centres would be appropriate at this time. The advice is that a co-ordinated and standard national approach to the recommencement of visiting is taken.</p><p>In light of the above, and on the basis that the COVID-19 disease status in the country remains in its current stable condition, the NPHET recommended that from 15th of June, the phased resumption of indoor visiting of residents in residential care facilities may commence in accordance with guidance issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The current guidance advises that indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is permissible in circumstances where certain criteria are followed. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff.</p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents.  Under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 as amended all nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process. They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.</p><p>Visitor guidance is being further refined by the HPSC at present and it is anticipated that updated guidance will be available shortly, once the refinement is complete. This guidance is under constant review, balancing risks with benefit in line with the disease trajectory in the community.</p></reply>

The strategy aims to provide an integrated public health approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery.</p><p>The Programme for Government endorses the national drugs strategy as providing a roadmap to treating the use of substances as a public health issue and to promoting a compassionate approach to people who use drugs.</p><p>The strategy contains 50 actions for delivery between 2017 to 2020. The implementation of these actions is monitored though the national oversight structures, supported by the coordinated system of monitoring, research and evaluation set out in the strategy.</p><p>A progress report on the implementation of the actions was published for the period to end 2018 and a further report, to end 2019 is being finalised.

The review will reflect on progress in implementing the strategy, and provide the flexibility to introduce new measures to address emerging needs. The review will be overseen by the national oversight committee.</p><p>I believe that the mid-term review is a timely opportunity to take account of the commitments in the Programme for Government<i>Our Shared Future</i>, and to addresses the challenges from Covid-19 for drug and alcohol services. I look forward to working with the colleagues in Government and with stakeholders to complete the mid-term review.</p></reply>
