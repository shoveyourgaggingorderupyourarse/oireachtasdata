Dublin City Council commissioned this report in response to the escalating levels of violence in the Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview areas of north Dublin in 2019 and 2020, and my officials have been in close contact with Dublin City Council on this matter. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the area&rsquo;s assets, services, and supports as well as its challenges. </p>  <p>  As well as important recommendations related to crime prevention and dismantling gangs, two key recommendations in the report include the need to strengthen community participants and leadership, and the need for more collaborative service delivery.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently developing a Community Safety Policy which takes a new approach to policing, crime prevention and youth engagement. It echoes many of the elements in the Darndale report, including the importance of strengthening community representation and leadership. Strong community participation in identifying the needs of a community and developing solutions is key.  Also central to the new policy is a more collaborative approach to service delivery, as identified in the report. Services need to work together to tackle the range of issues that makes a community feel unsafe, which goes beyond the sole remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This new approach is to be established on a pilot basis ahead of a nationwide rollout as part of 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Dublin City Council and former Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan on the follow up to this report in order to see how we can best support responses in the area. I would like to offer the Deputy my commitment to actively support the implementation of this report.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to note that a new Garda Building and Refurbishment programme 2022-2027 is currently under discussion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the OPW and officials from my Department.  This plan will include a new DMR North Divisional HQ at Northern Cross.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Programme for Government to convene an expert forum on anti-social behaviour and this will provide a key focus for further development of policy in this area. In addition, the Programme for Government further commits to developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, which will be finalised before the end of the year and which will provide a national developmental framework to pursue more effective engagement, collaboration and community support related to youth offending and the factors which underlie it.</p></reply>

It is expected that the public-facing elements of the inquest will begin in early 2021.</p><p>While the Coroner is entirely independent in carrying out her functions in relation to this matter, my Department is responsible for supporting the Dublin District Coroner.  To date, my Department has worked to provide her with the following supports:</p><p>- The provision of temporary office accommodation for the Stardust inquest team</p><p>- The assignment of additional staff to the office of the Dublin Coroner</p><p>- The development of a website for the inquest ()</p><p>- The appointment of legal and expert guidance for the Coroner</p><p>- ICT and other supports as required </p><p>As the Deputy has correctly stated, &euro;8 million in funding has been allocated for new inquests into the victims of the 1981 Stardust fire tragedy. However, while this will be sufficient to cover the above matters and other likely costs, the final cost of this inquest will not be clear for some time, as it will depend on the length of time and costs of legal and other expert advice deemed necessary by the Coroner.  Therefore at this time, I am not in a position to provide a more detailed estimate of the breakdown of costs.</p></reply>

The sex offender is obliged to notify the Garda&iacute; of their name and address for a period and any change in address must be notified within a specified time. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, this requirement can be imposed by a court even if no custodial sentence is imposed.</p>  <p>  The 2001 Act also provides for the monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders in the community through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service. It further provides for Sex Offenders orders which allow the court to prohibit a convicted sex offender from doing certain things with a view to protecting the public from serious harm.</p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; can apply to the courts for a Sex Offenders order and ensure that offenders comply with the terms of such an order.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also aware that I intend to amend the existing legislation relating to the monitoring of sex offenders and my officials are working closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to advance the drafting of this bill. Completion of this work is a matter to which I attach great importance. </p>  <p>  Turning to the question of the statistics requested, I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that, in 2019, the total number of reported incidents or breaches of Sex Offenders Act offences was 48, with 37 of those having resulted in follow up proceedings to date. </p>  <p>  The latest figures available for 2020, which are up to 13 October, show the total reported cases as 53 with 45 incidents to date resulting in proceedings. </p>  <p>  In terms of compliance levels, I am informed that 1625 people are currently subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act, so based on that, the above figures indicate a compliance rate of over 96% for 2020.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-22a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020102200087#WRA01300"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I consider the provision of appropriate mental health supports to be a matter of the highest importance.  This was one of a number of key issues I discussed with the  Garda Commissioner and his senior team when I met with them on 29 September 2020. The issue was also raised when I recently met the Garda Associations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the services available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am very conscious that there is also a cultural dimension to how mental health is viewed within an organisation, particularly a policing service.  Indeed, this is a recognised challenge for law enforcement agencies internationally.  It is therefore essential that Garda members and staff are encouraged to seek the supports they need, especially when dealing with the issues that can arise due to the nature of their work. Like in every organisation, these issues are exacerbated through Covid.</p>  <p>  From my recent discussions with the Commissioner and his senior team, I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very cognisant and concerned about the need to quantify these issues and further strengthen both how the organisation responds and to facilitate and encourage take-up by members.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland made a detailed recommendation in relation to enhancing wellness supports in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the adoption of a proactive approach to wellness for all personnel. The development of a Wellness Strategy is an important action currently being progressed under 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations. </p>  <p>  To support delivery of this action, my Department last year provided funding for a survey by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on wellness within the organisation. The findings provided a valuable insight and work is now underway on the development of a Wellness Strategy. In tandem, work is also underway with the Garda Chief Medical Officer on developing pathways  to support and treat colleagues who require assistance with their mental and indeed their physical health.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am assured that the range of welfare support structures already in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to be available to all personnel during the pandemic. These include the Employee Assistance Service (available to all Garda members, staff, Retired members, Trainees and Probationers, and their families), a 24/7/365 telephone helpline and counselling service provided by Inspire Wellbeing, the Inspire Wellbeing Hub, Peer Supports, and the chaplaincy service.</p>  <p>  I would urge all Garda personnel to avail of these services as and when they need them. It is vitally important that everyone understand that it's okay not to feel okay and that they are supported in this by the organisation, managers and all colleagues.</p></reply>

This prioritisation of technology and modernisation will lead to a significant payback of improved public services right across the justice sector, which is providing vital public services to keep people safe.</p>  <p>  For our highly trained Garda&iacute;, time saved on dealing with paperwork in the station means more time on the frontline on high visibility, preventative patrols . This will also help the Government drive the reform programme outlined in &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;, our implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, an additional &euro;22 million has been provided for Garda ICT in 2021. This is in addition to the budget originally available under the capital programme 2016-2021, and brings the total Garda ICT budget to over &euro;70 million for the second year in a row.  </p>  <p>  This is vital to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's comprehensive Digital Strategy 2019-2023, which was published last year incorporating key stakeholder engagement and which aims to ensure the vision for digital policing aligns with the organisation's other key strategies and priorities.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased that a separate &euro;7 million has been provided for additional mobile devices and related licensing and maintenance costs under the Garda Mobility project. These hand-held devices give Garda&iacute; instant access to real-time, secure information on the roadside through a range of apps which enable them to scan registration plates, quickly identify forged or false driving licences, and detect disqualified drivers, untaxed cars and stolen vehicles. This follows a &euro;4.9 million allocation for this project in 2020.</p>  <p>  The bulk of the annual capital investment in Garda ICT is required to fund the day-to-day support of existing systems, licences and infrastructure. In addition to this investment, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is using its ICT budget to deliver prioritised change initiatives including:</p>  <p>  - the Schengen Information System, for which &euro;6.2m has been provided in 2020 and &euro;4.4m for 2021;</p>  <p>  - the replacement of the Computer-Aided-Dispatch System, for which &euro;2.1m has been provided in 2020 and &euro;3.7m for 2021;</p>  <p>  - enhanced Data Centre equipment for which &euro;1.8m has been provided for 2020 and &euro;7m for 2021; and</p>  <p>  - the expansion of the Cyber Crime bureau for which &euro;1.8m has been provided for 2021.</p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing to engage with the Garda Commissioner as these and other important projects are rolled out and their benefits are realised. </p></reply>

There are legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.  I am, however, very much aware that parental alienation is a very complex issue and both I and Minister McEntee are keen to examine it further.  </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published a report last year on Reform of the Family Law System which includes parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Family Justice Oversight Group has recently been established in the Department which, in addition to my officials, also includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Group has been tasked with developing a family justice system, parallel to the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure, having regard to international best practice.  All of the various recommendations contained in the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s report, including the recommendation on parent alienation, will be included in the work of that group.  </p></reply>

In fact, as the Deputy will be aware, the D&oacute;chas Centre, which accommodates the majority of female prisoners in Ireland, was purposely built and specifically designed for women.  A particular focus of the design of the prison was to ensure that the women accommodated in the centre had access to a regime that mirrored, as much as possible, living in ordinary accommodation and thus supported the women's reintegration to society, which is a key objective of the prisons system.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that this issue was considered in the context of the Probation Service/Irish Prison Service joint Women Strategy 2014-2016, which sought to improve outcomes for women offenders.  A joint working group between the two agencies recommended that the most practical and cost effective way to address the needs identified was to develop a step down facility for women. In this regard, the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service worked collaboratively towards the identification of a suitable venue for a women&rsquo;s step down unit in Dublin, via a procurement process run by the Office of Government Procurement.</p>  <p>  The Outlook facility, which is run by Focus Ireland, currently has capacity for nine women in single occupancy units, and took in their first client from the D&oacute;chas Centre on 10 May 2019.  The facility is fully occupied at present.  The regime structure of the D&oacute;chas Centre allows effectively for the women in custody to progress from their initial accommodation to more enhanced houses in the D&oacute;chas Centre prior to progression to the Outlook step down accommodation facility, or to release, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, a contract was signed in February last year for a major redevelopment of Limerick Prison which includes the construction of a new prison facility for female prisoners. </p>  <p>  The new accommodation block for women offenders in Limerick which will replace the use of the female wing at that prison. The design of the new facility is based on the principle of rehabilitation and normalisation reflecting contemporary design standards.  A mix of accommodation units is being provided based around an external courtyard setting.  The development will provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners and is scheduled for completion in the last quarter of 2021. </p>  <p>  When open, this new facility will represent a complete change in the standard of accommodation and rehabilitative supports for all female prisoners and there are no current plans to provide an Open Centre for women.</p></reply>

This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. The methodology used in such allocation for any particular area is also a matter for the Commissioner and his management team, and as Minister I have no role in such matters.</p>  <p>  I understand that it is a matter for each Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  With respect to the number of officially designated Community Garda&iacute;, the Deputy may be interested to note that, to date, the official categorisation as a 'Community Garda' has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society, including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. This relationship is the fundamental building block underpinning 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p></reply>

What is deemed to be essential services or work during level 5 restrictions is set out on the Government website <i>www.gov.ie</i>. </p><p>Under previous level restrictions, where employees returned to the physical workplace the employer was required to ensure that the public health measures set out in the Return to Work Safely Protocol (RTWSP) are being fully adhered to.

Employers and employees should engage on this matter and seek to come to an agreement. If this is not possible, it is for the employer to decide, in the first instance, whether remote working arrangements are practicable in meeting the business&rsquo;s needs and to decide on what work can be done from home, while at all times taking account of the latest Public Health advice. </p><p>An employee with concerns around adherence to the RTWSP could bring their these concerns to the attention of the designated lead COVID-19 worker representative.

These actions, which are further underpinned by the Programme for Government, include developing the electric vehicle charging network necessary to support the growth of EVs and to ensure the supply of infrastructure stays sufficiently ahead of demand. The development of a strategy to meet these objectives is currently underway.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, the Government has provided &euro;36.5 million to support the growth of EVs and charging infrastructure during 2021. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle (EV) charging in Ireland and Government policy is to promote home charging in order to maintain this current high level of charging. To support home charging the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, continues to administer an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit for those with access to an off-street parking space which can be connected to their domestic supply.  </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning and legal issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues involved.  </p>  <p>  In relation to new build it should be noted that the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2018/844/EU) requires Member States to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential buildings and non-residential buildings, as well as those buildings with more than 10 parking spaces, for the purpose of enabling the installation at a later stage of charging points for electric vehicles (EVs) in such developments. It is intended that this EU requirement will be transposed into Irish law by end 2020. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. </p><p>The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 20 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 114,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year.  </p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the  roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 174 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 55 of theses are now connected  with  high speed broadband service  through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.  Locations in Mayo in areas such as Taugheen, Bofeenaun, Islandeady and Killaser Community Centres were chosen by the Department of Rural and Community Development in conjunction with Mayo County Council and are all installed and connected. Other locations installed and awaiting connection include Belderrig Community and Research Centre and Clare Island Community Centre. Further details can be found at <i></i>.</p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. </p><p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government is clear that the Government does not support the importation of fracked gas and commits to developing a Policy Statement to establish that approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department is developing the Policy Statement and the legal/regulatory provisions necessary to ensure LNG terminals could not, under any circumstances, import fracked gas. This includes detailed consideration of the European energy and environmental frameworks, in which our national laws operate, to ensure the Policy Statement will be legally robust. Once finalised, I intend to bring the Policy Statement to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a full updated technical analysis of the security of supply challenges and mitigating options and the undertaking of a public consultation. </p>  <p>  The review will inform future policy in relation to gas supplies, electricity interconnection, hydrogen, energy efficiency, demand management, gas storage, emergency reserves and other measures that would enhance our security of supply in the context of the doubling of the electricity generated from renewable sources (principally wind and solar) to 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s final consumption and the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

In addition to this, due to the social distancing requirements, normal daily capacity is considerably reduced. This means that customers will experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended. The public&rsquo;s patience and understanding in this regard is requested.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Priority then will be given in order of application date.  While there is some capacity for urgent test slots, the RSA's capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. Therefore, initially those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p></reply>

I do not believe that it is a suitable vehicle for broader application beyond its original policy goal and I have no plans at present to extend the scheme along the lines mentioned by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  An extension of Living City would amount to s. 23 type relief. These types of reliefs were, with good reason, ended a over decade ago. Also, a proposal to extend would have the potential for increased Exchequer costs and would give rise to state aid concerns.

The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p><p>The Supreme Court decision has raised complex legal and policy issues which will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  </p><p>In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p><p>While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis, without which it is impossible to continue accepting new applicants to the scheme.</p><p>Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. </p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.   </p>  <p>  The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p>  <p>  Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p>  <p>  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment, which will be known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo; (&ldquo;ACTE&rdquo;). The ACTE will provide an immediate cash support to businesses. The amount of the ACTE will be based on an amount equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in the case of new businesses, the average weekly turnover in 2020) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  All eligible businesses can claim the support irrespective of their turnover levels, but the amount of the ACTE cannot exceed the lower of the amount based on 10%/5% of the relevant weekly turnover or &euro;5,000 per week.  </p>  <p>  Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. </p>  <p>  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as certain musicians, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.   </p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business, such as a travel agency, has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  However, where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the business may qualify for the CRSS.</p>  <p>  Support provided under the CRSS will be in the form of a valuable upfront cash payment, enabling eligible businesses to meet costs associated with their business premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the restrictions announced by the Government, they cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to their customers or can only do so to a limited extent. The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable. </p></reply>

For 2020, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual. Where an individual exceeds the exemption limit, he or she is liable to tax based on the normal system of rate bands and tax credits, subject to marginal relief where relevant.</p>  <p>  Other tax supports for individuals in this age group include the Age Tax Credit which is available to all individuals aged 65 or over who do not qualify for an exemption from income tax. This credit is currently set at &euro;245 for single individuals or &euro;490 for a married couple or civil partners. </p>  <p>  In the context of limited resources, I am satisfied that the current income tax system is fair and equitable to individuals who are over the age of 66. </p>  <p>  In relation to the taxation of taxi drivers, I would highlight that as part of Budget 2021, the Earned Income Credit was increased to &euro;1,650.  This change will apply from the 2020 tax year and is targeted at those who are self-employed.</p>  <p>  The position with respect to individuals&rsquo; entitlements to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  However, I would note that as part of Budget 2021 it was announced that self employed workers can earn up to &euro;480 per month and still keep their PUP. </p>  <p>  Further, I would advise the Deputy that, subject to the other relevant qualifying criteria being met, there is no restriction on persons who are over 66 in the application of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), or the loss relief measure for the self-employed that was announced in the July Stimulus package.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Schemes introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19 have been some of the main tools with which we have protected the income of employees who otherwise would not be working. However, whilst I acknowledge the seriousness of the situation for some mortgage applicants, what I cannot do is mandate what information is required by regulators and lenders to complete lending sustainability evaluations. </p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is an economy wide scheme open to all sectors, as was the case for the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) before it. Unlike the TWSS however, which was an income support to the employee paid via the employer, the EWSS is a subsidy to the employer, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis. Up to &euro;350 may be claimed by the employer retrospectively for every worker who is paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 per week.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the EWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay and hours worked. A list of employers who have availed of the EWSS will ultimately be published.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that, as Minister for Finance, I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Furthermore I am specifically precluded from intervening in the case of any individual customer with any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, officials in my Department requested a comment from Bank of Ireland on the matter you have raised and received the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;At Bank of Ireland we are very conscious of the potential impact of COVID-19 on income levels and we assess each application carefully taking individual customer circumstances into consideration. Where customers are progressing mortgage applications and have affordability to do so, the Bank continues to support those applications.  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Where income has changed or where we are aware of potential challenges to a customer&rsquo;s income as a result of COVID-19, we are liaising with customers to understand their circumstances and assess if these are expected to change again in the future. This process has always been followed as it wouldn&rsquo;t be responsible to provide somebody with a mortgage at a level that they may struggle to afford now or in the future. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;We engage closely with our mortgage applicants on an ongoing basis to ensure we fully understand their circumstances. As part of this engagement we ask employers to confirm if their employee&rsquo;s income is supported by a Government scheme due to COVID-19. The Bank does not seek any information about financial support that may be provided to the employer.&rdquo; </p></reply>

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU. If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues. Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit.   </p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme. The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. </p>  <p>  The Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Any changes to the operation of the scheme will of course be kept under review by Revenue.</p></reply>

A repayment of contributions is only permitted in highly limited circumstances, for example due to ill-health, and as such, this would be subject to income tax. </p>  <p>  The policy rationale underpinning this is that the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. However, on actual drawdown, a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. In the event of any early encashment of a pension fund, the tax relief received must be clawed back. It should also be noted that any refund of pension contributions is governed by the terms of the specific scheme or product.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all matters of policy, while they are kept under review on a continuous basis I do not have any plans at this time to revise these pension arrangements.   </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that a very significant and comprehensive package of measures has already been put in place to assist individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), bank-related forbearance measures, and various other Government supports that were announced in the July Stimulus Package and in Budget 2021, such as the Re-Start Grants, Credit Guarantee Scheme, Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9%.</p></reply>

While hairdressing services will apply the 9% rate from 1 November, services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauticians, are subject to the 13.5% rate.  </p>  <p>  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As the services provided by beauticians are part of these parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.</p></reply>

Approval and funding was given and Roscommon County Council subsequently appointed Malachy Walsh and Partners to carry out this commission.  The report was submitted to the Office of Public Works who carried out a review in July 2020.  The outcome of this review determined that:</p>  <p>  - The study looked at seven possible flood mitigation measures, of which six fall below a cost-benefit of 1:1, and these are therefore not deemed to be cost effective.</p>  <p>  - There was significant uncertainty that the other possible scheme would solve the flooding effectively for the property in question, and the property is likely to remain at residual risk of flooding. There is no cost effective solution to manage this residual risk, with the current emergency management of flood levels being managed by pumping. This option is therefore not considered to be economically or environmentally sustainable.</p>  <p>  - Following the OPW&rsquo;s review of the Flood Analysis Report on Lough Funshinagh, the property-owners who have applied for the Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme will now be advanced through this scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works also understands, however, that there will remain a risk of possible prolonged flooding around the Lough, and have advised that it remains open to Roscommon County Council to make an application under the Minor Works Flood Mitigation Scheme should further measures be identified in the future that meet the scheme criteria to mitigate flooding.</p>  <p>  A meeting is to take place shortly between Roscommon County Council and officials in the Office of Public Works.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. </p>  <p>  There is no change to the staffing of the schools concerned for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for primary schools for the 2020/21 school year is currently at its lowest ever level with 1 teacher to 26 pupils. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  The unique challenges facing Gaeltacht schools and their importance in the maintenance of Irish as the main language of Gaeltacht communities is recognised. To support the delivery of high quality Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht schools, the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme was launched in 2017 as part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. A package of additional targeted supports has been provided to schools in the Scheme since September 2018 including:</p>  <p>  - access to an annual grant of &euro;1200 grant for the purchase of Irish-medium teaching resources</p>  <p>  - additional Irish-language support teaching hours based on school enrolment</p>  <p>  - additional continuing professional development for teachers, delivered by COGG</p>  <p>  - additional Inspectorate support via advisory visits to support schools in meeting their targets in the implementation of Irish-language-based criteria.</p>  <p>  Schools in the Scheme are permitted to form clusters to create temporary full-time posts by combining part-time Irish language support hours. Since 2019, schools in the Scheme have  also had the option to combine part-time Irish language support hours with special education teaching hours to create temporary full-time posts, provided that the teachers selected had a high level of proficiency in the Irish language and an understanding of immersion education, so that they could fulfil the roles, as appropriate. The terms of the operation of the Scheme are set out annually in Circulars which are published on the Department&rsquo;s website and disseminated to schools located in Gaeltacht language-planning areas. The most recent Circular relating to the operation of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in primary schools located in Gaeltacht areas during the 2020/21 school year is Circular 0010/2020. The operation of the Scheme in schools must also take place in accordance with the provisions of Department advice and circulars relating to COVID-19. </p></reply>

All schools were provided with the HSE document titled: &ldquo;Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health approach&rdquo;, setting out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the school community, and also the principles that will underpin the management of outbreaks or potential outbreaks and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility. There has been no change to the  definition of close contact in the school setting.  </p>  <p>  COVID-19 testing, and the broader public health response to COVID-19 infections in a school is led and managed by the local HSE Public Health team. All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.  This involves the HSE Department of Public Health liaising directly with the designated school contact, usually the school principal. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that public health measures are acted upon speedily by schools and areas of concerns raised by schools are addressed. As part of this close collaboration, the HSE Department of Public Health are in the process of establishing school focused teams in their respective public health areas to further assist schools while risk assessment are being conducted and to provide assistance and guidance to schools in instances where members of the school community may be a suspected or confirmed case.  </p>  <p>  This is an important measure of reassurance and support for schools on their return from mid-term break. In the interim My Department will liaise with individual schools in the event of a suspect or confirmed outbreak to ensure that Public Health teams are alerted so that appropriate follow up action is taken.  </p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to work with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that testing is prioritised for those close contacts within the school community of confirmed COVID-19 cases.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the experience of public health to date is that transmission rates of Covid-19 in schools are low, much lower than the rate currently in the community. This is a result of the effectiveness of the public health guidelines for schools and the successful implementation and adherence of all in the school community to the guidelines. </p></reply>

While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only. Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical  schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1.  The reason for this is due to the fact that the differential has narrowed further following the announcement of an overall reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule to 25:1.  </p>  <p>  The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2milion in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.  My Department continues to support those schools most in need and I intend to engage with the relevant stakeholders as to how best to achieve this.  </p></reply>

This practice ensures that no principal is burdened with the responsibility of making a public health decision.  </p><p>Should a school be notified of a positive case, Schools should await a call from the Dept. of Public Health. This will usually be on the same day but may be on the following day depending on their assessment. This is safe, as the case is no longer within the school setting, and therefore the risk of onward transmission from this case is no longer there. If the case was not in the school setting whilst infectious, then public health will not routinely call the school.</p><p>Public Health  will carry out a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) with the school and advise the school of what actions are necessary.  </p><p>My Department is working closely with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that public health measures are acted upon speedily by schools and areas of concerns raised by schools are addressed. As part of this close collaboration, the HSE Department of Public Health are in the process of establishing school focused teams in their respective public health areas to further assist schools while risk assessment are being conducted and to provide assistance and guidance to schools in instances where members of the school community may be a suspected or confirmed case.  </p><p>This is an important measure of reassurance and support for schools on their return from mid-term break. In the interim My Department will liaise with individual schools in the event of a suspect or confirmed outbreak to ensure that Public Health teams are alerted so that appropriate follow up action is taken.  </p><p>My Department will also continue to work with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that testing is prioritised for those close contacts within the school community of confirmed COVID-19 cases.  </p><p>It is important to note that the experience of public health to date is that transmission rates of Covid-19 in schools are low, much lower than the rate currently in the community. This is a result of the effectiveness of the public health guidelines for schools and the successful implementation and adherence of all in the school community to the guidelines. </p></reply>

Member States. </p><p>In general, an approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State. </p><p>In relation to supports for students studying in the State there are two categories of student for the purpose of the student  grant scheme - &ldquo;student&rdquo; and &ldquo;tuition student&rdquo;; broadly a &ldquo;student&rdquo; meets the residency requirement in the State, satisfies the nationality requirements and may be eligible for maintenance grant and fee grant whereas the &ldquo;tuition student&rdquo; meets the residency requirement in a Member State, the EEA or Switzerland, satisfies the nationality requirements and may be eligible for fee grant only.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme does not and never has extended to the payment of tuition fees to institutions outside the State other than for exceptional provision in respect of postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland. This provision is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday agreement and is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding between both jurisdictions.  To fund tuition fees to institutions outside the State would represent a major policy change, which has the potential to impose very significant additional costs for the Exchequer.</p><p>In relation to tuition fees, there is provision for tax relief, at the standard rate in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in other E.U. Member States. </p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided the following update on this matter. </p>  <p>  Wicklow Courthouse is included in a number of projects in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements that are outlined in the previous Government's National Development Plan 2018 - 2027. </p>  <p>  The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period of the plan remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective. </p>  <p>  A courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (e.g. consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites, etc.) is envisaged as being required to meet current and future demand in Wicklow. This will require a building significantly larger than the existing two courtroom building. The Courts Service proposes to refurbish and extend the courthouse to provide the required accommodation. As a prerequisite first step, the Courts Service has acquired a number of adjoining properties that were in council ownership so as to have available a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged. </p>  <p>  Facilitating works envisaged for the refurbishment and extension of Wicklow courthouse include the demolition of the 1940s extension/annex to the rear of the courthouse. In view of the fact that dry rot has spread extensively throughout the extension, the Courts Service proposes to bring this element of the facilitating works forward rather than incur the cost of treating the dry rot only to demolish the extension at a later date as part of the overall development. It will be necessary to go through the Part IX planning process in advance of this work. The Courts Service has been in contact with the state architect about these works and it is intended that they will proceed subject to funding being available and OPW resource availability in light of commitments in other areas.</p></reply>

It is also the case that prisoners will not always declare their affiliation to certain groupings and it is therefore not possible to provide definitive numbers in relation to the number of known members of criminal groupings currently in custody. It should also be noted that more than one criminal gang may group together under the umbrella of a particular group and in some instances some gangs may form splinter groups due to family or in house disputes.</p>  <p>  The emergence in recent years of criminal groupings has had significant implications for the management of Irish Prisons. Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside the prison. Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart, and as far as possible, that members of criminal groups do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities outside. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to preventing identified members of criminal groups from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons. For example, certain security initiatives have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison. These initiatives include the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines, as well as the gathering and collating of intelligence information on members of criminal groups in custody, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband, including mobile phones, into prisons.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal groupings. </p></reply>

It will ensure that we are adopting a proactive and strategic view of justice policy formulation and review, providing &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; advice in the long-term interest of all citizens. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say we have some statistical evidence available to suggest that the introduction of initiatives introduced to reduce prison re-offending have contributed to a decline in recidivism. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) use data from the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop comprehensive prison re-offending indicators. The 3-year re-offending indicator counts prisoners who re-offended within three years of release from custody, and who secured a court conviction within a further two years. The latest reoffending statistics produced by the CSO demonstrate that prison re-offending rate has been in decline from 2011 to 2017. Looking at the three year re-offending rate, 55.2% of prisoners released in 2014 re-offended within three years of release, an 8.6% decrease on re-offending levels of 63.8% for prisoners released in 2011. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that a number of initiatives were introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending; </p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. In order to reduce crime and enhance public safety, the selected prolific offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.</p>  <p>  An example of the impact of legislation in this area includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which provides that a court shall consider the appropriateness of a community service order in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months is being considered.  There has been a consistent increase in the management of community service orders by the Probation Service over the past three years. In 2019, the Probation Service managed 2,791 Community Service Orders, totalling 379,815 hours work, in lieu of 1,247 years in prison, which equated to &euro;3 million of unpaid work.  Despite this, the use of short sentences is prevalent with a significant increase in prison committals for persons serving less than three months and, more generally, less than 12 months.  The impact of this legislation does need to be considered, including in relation to the number of shorter sentences for offences committed by women and the high incidence of women on remand,  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This research report is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department,  was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law, UCD. </p>  <p>  The review sought to address a range of questions relating to the factors underpinning recidivist and prolific offending behaviour; public policy interventions that tackle recidivism and prolific offending; and the effectiveness of these interventions and likelihood of successful transplantation to an Irish context.</p>  <p>  Key findings of the report include the following:</p>  <p>  - Suspended sentences or community service can be more effective in terms of reducing recidivism than short terms of imprisonment.</p>  <p>  - Planned and structured early release, including parole, may reduce recidivism.</p>  <p>  - Perception of fairness may have an impact on likelihood of recidivism. A perception of procedural unfairness can lead to alienation, resistance and noncompliance whereas a belief that one has been treated fairly may reduce the likelihood of future offending.</p>  <p>  - There appears to be a significant treatment effect associated with cognitive behavioural interventions delivered both in community and custodial settings.</p>  <p>  The review will constitute a valuable resource for researchers and act as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area and provide a body of evidence essential to inform future policy discussions and development. The full report is available on the website of my Department and builds on the Department&rsquo;s commitment, outlined in the 2018-2020 Data and Research Strategy, to support the development of more evidence-informed policy making.</p>  <p>  I hope the Deputy will understand that the specific information on the number of repeated offenders in each crime category in each of the past five years to date, as requested is not readily available.</p></reply>

Crimes against the Person and Sexual Offences, for which continuous upward trends have been observed in recent years, have stabilised in 2020.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Fire certificate was granted on 30th June 2020.  Preparation of contract documentation has commenced, and contractor selection is complete subject to a cooling off period.  </p>  <p>  Works and schedules were delayed due to COVID-19, however the project went to tender on the 30th September.  As required by OGP, the tender is a 2-stage process for Main and Specialist contractors. This process will take approximately four months. The works to the new Cath laboratory are due to commence in Q1 of 2021 with a proposed 12-month build.  It is anticipated the second Cath laboratory will become fully operational after construction and equipping has been completed.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise, the delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.</p></reply>

Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. </p>  <p>  The utilisation rate of critical care beds in private hospitals varied throughout the three month period in which the agreement was in place. The HSE has advised the Department that in the last week of April 53% of critical care beds in private hospitals were in use, while in the last week of June 48% of critical care beds were in use. </p>  <p>  In terms of wider critical care capacity, as part of work undertaken earlier this year to determine the capacity of the private hospital system, it was estimated that there were 47 ICU beds and 54 High Dependency Unit beds within the private hospital system.</p></reply>

The Irish bTB eradication programme uses two main diagnostic tests for live animals:</p>  <p>  -  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT), often referred to as the skin test, which is the test most widely used in an Irish context.</p>  <p>  -  The gamma interferon test (a blood test) which is used as an adjunct to the SICTT in known infected herds.</p>  <p>  These are the two tests recognised under EU regulation 64/432, which is the basis for enabling our cattle to trade within the EU.</p>  <p>  Additionally, another blood test, the Tb ELISA test, is also used where necessary as a tool where there are intractable TB breakdowns to try to identify chronically infected individual animals which are still clinically normal but whose immune system is not capable of reacting to the tuberculin skin test.</p>  <p>  For samples taken from animals suspected of having TB lesions detected at routine slaughter, such samples are tested using bacteriological culture and histopathological examination.</p>  <p>  My Department has for many years supported and funded research and development of new diagnostic tools for bTB, and continues to do so. This includes work to validate new molecular diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on post-mortem samples, research into the use of novel antigens to improve the performance of the gamma interferon test on blood samples and research into immunological variations in cattle affecting the response to bTB. This work involves collaborations with UCD and Teagasc, with private sector companies seeking to validate tests, and with research groups in other countries such as the UK which face similar challenges to us in respect of bTB.</p>  <p>  When performed correctly, the TB skin test continues to be the best and most accurate diagnostic screening test available for use in cattle.  In particular, it has an exceptionally high specificity i.e. the rate of false positive results with the Tb skin test is very low - less than 1 in 5,000 tests gives a false positive result.  While the possibility of human error cannot be eliminated, my Department has a robust quality control programme in place to ensure accuracy and consistency in relation to test performance. Testing can only be carried out by authorised veterinary practitioners and the authorisation process includes taking part in a DAFM training course.  The performance of Tb tests by veterinary practitioners is subject to unannounced inspection and supervision by DAFM Veterinary Inspectors. </p>  <p>  An IT system is used to evaluate and measure the testing performance of individual veterinary practitioners, using a number of test performance quality indicators including the number of positives detected in comparable groups, and the results of this evaluation is communicated to each veterinary practitioner.  The results of this evaluation is also used as the basis for risk-based inspections of testing veterinarians by DAFM Veterinary Inspectors. As an additional layer of quality control on the accuracy and standard of skin testing, a significant number of reactor animals are blood tested using the gamma interferon blood test.  Sanctions, including suspension from testing, are applied where veterinary practitioners are found where significant non compliances are found. In relation to the rotation of personnel, in general the individual farmer who pays for the herd test chooses the veterinary practitioner who carries out his annual herd test.  In relation to other testing (reactor retests, contiguous tests etc), my Department assigns some of those tests to other veterinary testers on a risk basis as a result of epidemiological investigations, area risks, test risks and herd risks.</p></reply>

Certain categories of farmers could surrender their original payment entitlements to the National Reserve. In exchange, these farmers received a lower number of payment entitlements with an increased payment entitlement unit value.</p>  <p>  The EU regulations governing the current Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) do not provide for the consolidation of payment entitlements. In addition, consolidation is not planned in the Basic Income Support Scheme (BISS) under the new CAP programme. The opportunity for consolidation is also not provided for as part of the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme (ANC);  payments made under this scheme are paid directly on land at a rate dependent on the categorisation.  They are not based on payment entitlements.</p></reply>
