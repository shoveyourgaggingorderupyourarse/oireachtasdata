Latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the target for the RDP was to attract some 16,000 hectares of new land into production and to support 46,000 hectares of converted land. These targets have been more than exceeded</p>  <p>  The Organic Farming Scheme  (OFS) was re-opened in November 2018 on a targeted basis on foot of the recommendation of the Organic Sector Strategy Group. Following assessment by the Group and based on market demand and supply deficits in organic horticulture, cereals and dairy, the Group recommended the re-opening of the OFS targeting expenditure towards sectors in deficit.  Selection criteria which would facilitate such a targeted reopening were agreed by the Group.  </p>  <p>  The eligibility process required applicants to submit a BPS application (by 15 May 2019) and a certificate of completion of an Approved Training Course.  The determination of eligible applications and the ranking and selection process could only commence following the deadline for receipt of the mandatory educational certification which was 1 September, 2019. </p>  <p>  A total of 225 applications were received by the closing date for applications. 58 applications were either withdrawn or deemed ineligible.  Following the ranking and selection process, one applicant withdrew, 55 were successful and 111 farmers were unsuccessful. One of the successful farmers is from Donegal.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is a targeted re-opening and that I would fully expect that there will be a new Organics scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process.</p></reply>

This came as a result of &ldquo;the severe and significant weaknesses detected in the Irish control system&rdquo; during an audit carried out by the Commission in Killybegs, in 2018. Principally, the Commission identified shortcomings related to the effective control of pelagic fisheries, issues related to underreporting of catches of these species, the inadequate and ineffective sanctioning system for offences committed by operators and the lack of control and enforcement of bluefin tuna catches by recreational vessels. </p>  <p>  The formal administrative inquiry requires Ireland to provide further substantial volume of information on these specific findings to enable the Commission to further evaluate Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to apply the rules of the CFP and to assess the potential consequences of any failure to do so.  The Commission will analyse the information provided by Ireland and identify any further steps or actions necessary. A similar type investigation in another Member State in relation to pelagic controls resulted in significant quota reductions.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I have no role in the operational control matters which formed the Audit findings. The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.  The issues arising in the administrative inquiry are operational matters for SFPA and, as Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in these matters.  </p>  <p>  The information required by the Commission includes large amounts of primary data. I understand that the SFPA have had a number of meetings with DG Mare to keep them abreast of progress. Department officials have had regular meeting with the SFPA from a corporate governance and policy perspective. I am advised that the SFPA is also liaising with stakeholders on the issues arising from the inquiry.</p></reply>

The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB) is the regulatory body for all horseracing in Ireland.  The Board is a company limited by guarantee set up by the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee for the purpose of carrying out the regulatory and licensing functions for Irish horseracing. </p>  <p>  The  HRI and IHRB have informed me that 128 horses have been fatally injured racing at point-to-points and Irish racecourses to date this year. This figure represents 0.38% of the 33,746 runners in the same period and, given the mix of racing in Ireland (flat and national hunt)  is consistent with other major racing jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The IHRB have also informed me that it is impractical to ascertain the number of injuries at racecourses/point-to-points. The timing of the injury will not always be obvious at the racecourse - for example, a horse could be injured when travelling to/from racecourses from the trainers yard. They may be withdrawn at a racecourse as a result of an injury sustained in previous days which is only apparent at a later time.</p>  <p>  In common with other jurisdictions, the Irish racing authorities take equine welfare extremely seriously.  The focus is to minimise the risk of injury to horse and jockey as much possible by ensuring that every link in the chain of care that surrounds our horses is a strong one. </p>  <p>  On the race track, clerks of the course, employed by the IHRB and therefore, independent of the racecourses, work closely with the management of each track to maximise the safety of the course for horse and jockey.  Many new initiatives have taken place in recent years in areas such as track surfaces, irrigation policies, hurdle and fence design and race surface maintenance.</p>  <p>  Horses receive first class veterinary care at the track, from the vets providing first aid, from the Blue Cross and from the independent IHRB regulatory veterinary team.  Every race meeting must have at least three veterinary surgeons present. There are pre-race risk-based inspections, appropriate and timely first aid in the event of an injury and careful follow up around each horse on the raceday itself.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied therefore that adequate precautions are in place to protect horses as far as is practicable.</p></reply>

However, since then the independent chair and my Department continue to engage proactively with Taskforce members with a view to both progressing the implementation of the provisions of the agreement.</p><p>My Department and its agencies continue to progress the commitments which they signed up to under the Agreement. <b></b>The full text of the Agreement between beef sector stakeholders, along with an update on the progress made on the action points to date, is available on my Department's website:   </p><p>An immediate increase in a range of bonuses was announced as part of the 15 September Agreement. It has been confirmed to my Department that this bonus system is now in place.</p><p>Initiatives in the Agreement aimed at improving information along the supply chain included the commissioning of the following reports:  an independent review of market and customer requirements; an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal along the supply chain; and a summary of competition law issues as relevant to the Irish beef sector. My Department has issued the Request for Tender for these reports, with a deadline for receipt of Tender Responses of 12 noon on Thursday 5th December. This will enable award of the tender before the end of 2019.</p><p>In relation to market transparency initiatives, my Department:</p><p>- has published an expert report on mechanical carcase classification review;</p><p>- has introduced an appeals system for manual grading; and </p><p>- has initiated a consultation process on the transposition of the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive, with a deadline for submission of 13 December.</p><p>Bord Bia has developed a beef market price index model based on 3 components: cattle price index, beef market price index (retail and wholesale) and an offal price indicator. This is now available on the Bord Bia website: </p><p>Teagasc is significantly advanced in the first stage of the scientific review of the Quality Payment Grid(QPS). </p><p>My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent months. </p><p>I established the Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. As I have previously stated, it is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef sector that the work of the Taskforce goes ahead.  I hope that all parties will agree to come together around the table as soon as possible in order to progress this important work.</p></reply>

Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy. </p>  <p>  A range of supports for this particular sector is available both from my Department and in links with other Government Departments. </p>  <p>  I understand that approximately 500 artisan and speciality food companies with a turnover of between &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services they offer, include marketing assistance, specialised training, capacity building and promotion. </p>  <p>  Funding under the Rural Innovation &amp;amp; Development Fund is provided by my Department for initiatives designed to promote agri-food tourism in rural areas. Agri-food tourism broadly is the practice of offering an activity or activities in rural areas to visit areas of well-known agricultural produce and to sample and taste the local or regional cuisine or specialties. It also encompasses local food, farmer and artisan market schemes that support and are paired with local and seasonal food producers and artisan crafts. Following the 2019 call for proposals, I announced funding totalling &euro;243,000 for  twelve agri-food tourism projects in June this year. </p>  <p>  Last year, together with my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, I launched the &lsquo;LEADER Food Initiative'. This funding is provided from my Department under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), and is delivered using the LEADER methodology via the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It supports new and existing artisan, micro and small food producers to address emerging challenges through investment in areas such as capital equipment, market development, competitiveness and innovation.  I understand that 34 projects with a total value of more than &euro;1.9 million have been approved under the Scheme to date. </p>  <p>  The Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation also provide funding for local food initiatives through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), thirty one dedicated teams located in the Local Authorities nationwide which provide expert advice and guidance to all small businesses.</p>  <p>  Taken together, all of these initiatives support farm and local community diversification and help farmers and small food businesses to connect with the wider community. From a Government perspective, they provide a collaborative framework for different Departments and agencies to work together for the development of the Small Business food sector.</p></reply>

While agriculture contributes to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, the sector also has the means to be part of the alleviation process and has a key role to play in transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland's long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector is 'an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production'. </p>  <p>  While carbon neutrality is yet to be fully defined, our policy approach is based on three principles: </p>  <p>  - Reducing agriculture emissions; </p>  <p>  - Increasing carbon sequestration; and </p>  <p>  - The displacement and substitution of fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p>  <p>  Indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and will become even more important in the context of reducing our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030 and decarbonising our energy systems by 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a 16% target for renewable energy by 2020 and the production of indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping us meet this renewable energy target and my Department has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials in this regard.</p>  <p>  Through the forestry programme, my Department is committed to increasing the supply of biomass from Ireland&rsquo;s forests.  In 2018, 40% of the wood fibre used in Ireland was used for energy generation, mainly within the forest products sector, up from 34% a couple of years ago. This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.</p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018 total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood.</p>  <p>  The Department did previously operate a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production. However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. On-going support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific &ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed.</p></reply>

It is focussed on measures which will further reduce transmission of bTB. In the coming weeks, I will be launching a renewed strategy underpinned by the principle of supporting and empowering farmers to reduce the bTB risk to their cattle by making informed choices to protect their herd and their neighbour&rsquo;s herds. Equally, there is a particular focus on assisting herdowners whose herds are affected with bTB and to clear their herds of infection. </p><p>Stakeholders have recognised that further preventative measures are required if the ambition of eradication by 2030 is to be achieved. Steadily reducing the risk of disease transmission is the best way in which support can be provided to all Irish farmers &ndash; those whose herds are impacted by bTB and critically those whose herds are clear and who wish to remain free of the disease. The recommendations made by the bTB Stakeholders Forum will inform the development of this strategy, and stakeholder involvement and leadership will continue to be critical to successfully eradicating bTB.</p><p>The risks associated with each potential transmission channel will be reduced through a series of coordinated measures, which will be applied in addition to the existing programme and in full compliance with the EU requirements for bTB eradication. </p><p>While the strategy is still be being finalised, some of it central themes will be:</p><p>1. Reducing the spread of bTB via cattle to cattle transmission.</p><p>2. Reduce transmission at the cattle/wildlife interface</p><p>3.

The Scheme has more than achieved its targets in terms of new land converted and the maintenance of organic land. </p>  <p>  As a further vote of confidence in the organics sector by this Government, my colleague Minister Doyle established an Organic Sector Strategy Group last year, comprising relevant stakeholders and state bodies. The Group recommended re-opening the Scheme but on a targeted basis. The sectors targeted were those for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  Selection criteria with revised marking, which would facilitate such a targeted reopening, were agreed by the Group.  In assessing the case for  re-opening the Scheme, the Group recognised that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the Organic Farming Scheme state that an applicant must reach a minimum ranking of 25 marks to be deemed eligible for consideration for inclusion in the Scheme.  They further state that the number of applications to be accepted into the Scheme will be determined by funding; the submission of a valid application does not guarantee entry to the Scheme. No changes were made to the minimum ranking of 25 marks - it is the same as in previous OFS under the current RDP. Once applicants reached the minimum ranking of 25 and met the other eligibility criteria, they were then assessed under the Ranking and Selection system in accordance with the criteria agreed by the Organic Sector Strategy Group.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this was a targeted re-opening and that I fully expect that there will be a new Organics Scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process. </p></reply>

Following assessment by the Group and based on market demand and supply deficits in organic horticulture, cereals and dairy, the Group recommended the re-opening of the OFS targeting expenditure towards sectors in deficit.  Selection criteria which would facilitate such a targeted reopening were agreed by the Group. </p>  <p>  The Organic Strategy Group, comprising a range of stakeholders, in assessing the case for re-opening the Scheme, focussed on the current production profile of the Irish Organic Sector and market opportunities. The Group concluded that while the area under organic production has increased, production patterns are not fully aligned with market opportunities. Most organic farmers are engaged in beef and/or sheep production with a relatively low number engaged in tillage and dairy. However, market demand and supply deficits were in the areas of dairy, horticulture and cereals.</p>  <p>  Based on this research and analysis of the current profile of the Irish Organic Sector, the Organic Strategy Group therefore concluded that the key to long term sustainable growth is to ensure that the  development of organic production is aligned to market requirements and consumer demand.  To this end, it was decided that the sectors to be targeted in a re-opened Organic Farming Scheme should be horticulture, dairy and tillage.  </p>  <p>  Of the 55 applications that were accepted, almost 70% have one of the three targeted areas as their main enterprise.  The other applications that were accepted all have land under one of the targeted areas albeit not as their main enterprise.  Of those that were unsuccessful, 95% come from outside of the targeted sectors.</p>  <p>  This re-opening was targeted at certain production areas and I am satisfied that the successful applicants will help ensure further sustainable growth in the organic sector.</p></reply>

There has been a significant expansion in the forest estate from 1% at the turn of the 20th century to 770,000 hectares or 11% today, but this is indeed well short of the EU average. It is our clear intention, as outlined in the Climate Action Plan, to increase this percentage by facilitating the planting of 8,000 hectares per year.</p>  <p>  Support for afforestation is delivered through the generous grants and premiums available, across 12 different planting categories which offer real options to suit every landowner.  Under this afforestation scheme, my Department covers 100% of the cost of establishing new forests and also provides annual premium payments which are paid for 15 years.  It is notable that during the course of the Forestry Programme so far, this approach has resulted in 2,500 farmers planting a total of 16,000 hectares of forestry on their land.  </p>  <p>  In relation to setting aside 10% of agricultural land for forestry, I believe that farmers must make  choices that suit their individual  farming enterprises. I would rather present forestry as a viable option for farmers to supplement their farming enterprise, rather than having a compulsory set aside area.  </p>  <p>  However, we will be introducing a new forestry programme in due course, and that will provide an opportunity to review the current schemes and configure them to maximise the incentive to plant forestry.</p></reply>

Although they are considered to be separate stocks, herring in the southern part of 6a and 7bc is combined with that from the northern part of 6a by ICES for the purposes of assessment. This is because the survey and catch data that informs the assessment includes mixed aggregations of herring. Currently, work is underway to determine markers (genetic and physical) which may be used to separate the stocks in the survey and in any potential mixed catches.  </p>  <p>  As herring in both stock areas are in a depleted state, ICES has advised zero catches since 2016 for each. However, ICES also advises that a low level of catch could be taken to facilitate sampling of the stock in support of the stock assessment and the ongoing genetic work on stock identity.</p>  <p>  The EU set a TAC of 5,800 t each year from 2016-2019 with 4,170 t  allocated to 6aN  and 1,630 t allocated to  6aS 7bc. The proposal for 2020 is 17% decrease for both areas to bring the TACs into line with ICES advice.  The herring caught in the Foyle cannot be considered a separate herring stock and there is no case that it should be subject to a separate TAC and quota regime.  The 7W meridian which divides the two stock areas cuts through the Foyle, much of Lough Foyle is west of 7W and thus can be considered as part of the  6aS 7bc TAC area. </p>  <p>  The 2012 herring management policy has been set aside because this is a scientific data collection fishery  which is being  made available to support sampling to provide a more accurate picture of the state of the stock.  The arrangements in place for 2019 have  been discussed and proposed by industry following a meeting of industry stakeholders held on 26 July 2019.   The arrangements provide opportunities for 19 under 12m vessels which did not have a track record under the 2012 herring policy.  Other category of vessels in the fishery were required to have the track record as set down in the 2012 policy.  Vessels were invited to book into the fishery and were selected by lottery.  The fishery opened on 28 October.</p></reply>

The supports currently offered under the forestry programme cover 100% of the cost of establishing new forests and also provides annual premium payments which are paid each year for 15 years. For native woodlands, these annual premiums can be as high as &euro;680 per hectare.  We will continue to offer these supports, which can and have been used by farmers as income which supplements their farming enterprise.</p>  <p>  It is my firm belief that the concept of "farm forestry" should remain at the heart of our promotion of forestry to farmers. This is to say that forestry becomes part of the farm enterprise alongside other  production and not necessarily the sole enterprise. This is key to diversifying the farmer's income. </p>  <p>  We also provide generous supports for farmers and other landowners after they have planted. These support measures include funding for the construction of forests roads, thinning of broadleaves and knowledge transfer groups. During the current year, my Department introduced a number of new schemes to further promote forestry.  These included a second grant for thinning broadleaves, supports for transitioning to a continuous cover forestry management model and a new Woodland Environmental Fund. </p>  <p>  I accept that, in recent times, fewer farmers have opted for forestry. This can be attributed to a variety of reasons, some of which relate to competing sources of income and other considerations such as a negative perception of forestry, an attachment to conventional farming and a perception that there are significant administrative and technical barriers to approval.</p>  <p>  As regards other barriers to farmers planting, we are currently reviewing the COFORD Forestry Land Availability Implementation Report recommendations in this regard. We will also have an opportunity under the next CAP to integrate forestry more fully across our agricultural schemes and to promote the inclusion of farm forestry as part of a successful farming enterprise.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to promoting the many multifunctional benefits of forestry.  We are funding 15 promotional projects throughout the country as well as Teagasc initiatives which provide advice directly to farmers on how to incorporate forestry into their holdings and how to manage their forest asset.</p></reply>

In May 2018, I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid, calling for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  This memorandum was widely supported by 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.

Food Wise contains a vision of thriving primary producers and agri-food businesses at the heart of vibrant communities across the country and was built upon five cross-cutting themes &ndash; environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation and human capital. </p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy aims to grow the Irish agri-food sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food. In terms of carbon footprint per unit of output, Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of milk and beef. Under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability.</p>  <p>  Preparations are now underway for the next ten-year strategy for the agri-food sector to 2030. A public consultation was launched in July to ascertain the views of all stakeholders on the direction of the sector to 2030 and a national stakeholder consultation event was held on 16 October in the Aviva Stadium. </p>  <p>  I will shortly convene a Committee made up of representatives from across the sector. The Committee will be tasked with preparing a strategy for the development of the agri-food sector for the period to 2030. The strategy will outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) will also be conducted in parallel with the work of the Committee. This is to ensure that environmental considerations are fully integrated into the preparation of the strategy and is a legal requirement. It is anticipated that the overall process will be complete, and the new strategy launched in mid-2020.</p>  <p>  The All-of-Government Plan to tackle climate breakdown identifies a series of actions for the agriculture, forestry and land-use sector that ensure a fair contribution from agriculture and land use to our transition to a low carbon economy and society. This reflects our policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production and sets a target to reduce emissions from agriculture by between 10 - 15% by 2030, which is extremely ambitious. </p>  <p>  The Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) provides a suite of actions that provide opportunities for emissions reductions including both efficiency measures, such as the Dairy EBI programme, and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading. This is in addition to a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures.</p>  <p>  Reducing emissions between now and 2030 will require us to manage the emissions profile from the sector between now and then through mobilisation of as many of these actions as possible, as early as possible, with high rates of adoption across our 139,000 farms.</p></reply>

Such transitional measures are normal practice between consecutive programming periods, to provide legal and financial certainty where a gap arises due to any delays in finalising a new EU Budget and CAP regulations. </p>  <p>  The recent Council accepted the need for such proposals and broadly welcomed them. However, discussions are ongoing, with a number of key issues yet to be agreed.</p>  <p>  The Commission proposals provide he option to extend the current Rural Development Programme, in certain circumstances.  It aims at providing certainty on the process around granting of support for the year 2021. Agreement on this regulation is not expected to be achieved until Summer 2020, subject to agreement on the EU budget.  Discussions on this latter regulation will continue over the coming months. </p>  <p>  The transitional regulations are complex and a number of issues need to be considered in more detail, in relation to the Rural Development Programme and how the transitional regulation will work in practice.  I am continuing to work with the Commission and my European Ministerial colleagues to reach agreement on these important legislative proposals and provide certainty to Irish farmers at the earliest possible date. </p>  <p>  I expect that the transitional regulations will, at a minimum, provide for the extension of the existing RDP into 2021 and there should be no interruption in direct payments. It may also be possible to provide for new Agri Environment, climate, organic farming or animal welfare schemes, for a maximum of three years.  The precise arrangements will be clarified when agreement is reached on the regulations. </p>  <p>  In the meantime the N+3 rule will continue to apply, so that scheme commitments entered into by farmers prior to the end of 2020 will continue to be honoured after that date. </p>  <p>  Also at Council, my European Ministerial colleagues and I also had the opportunity to discuss the Finnish Presidency's proposal to set a single common percentage, or fixed amount, for environmental and climate purposes across the whole CAP Strategic Plan, as opposed to defined percentages for particular pillars.    </p>  <p>  I am a strong proponent of the higher level of environmental ambition in the next CAP and I am ready to explore all possible options.  However, I believe the details of the Finnish Presidency's proposal will have to be developed further before we reach any definitive conclusions.  It is essential that the proposed new environmental conditionality is implemented effectively, with common standards that are relevant and effective. </p>  <p>  I took the opportunity to again reiterate that it is vitally important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered by farmers. Negotiations for the CAP post 2020 are still ongoing and I will continue to seek to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

This reflects our commitment towards  working to the planting target of 8,000 hectares contained in the Climate Action Plan. I am more than aware that this level of planting will be challenging and that it will require shared action from the private sector, public bodies and the community at large, including business.</p>  <p>  We are doing all that we can to expedite planning appeals. A report which we commissioned from an external consultant, reviewing our approval process, is due this week and will, I expect, contain recommendations which will make the system more efficient and effective.  We will also be looking at  other issues which affect landowner participation in the scheme and are currently reviewing the COFORD Forestry Land Availability Implementation Report in this regard.</p>  <p>  It is likely that planting private land alone will not be sufficient to deliver 8,000 hectares, which is why Coillte's proposed planting of 1,500 hectares of former Bord na Mona land over the next three years is very welcome. I am hopeful that other public bodies will follow suit and will be looking for support from my colleagues in government, local authorities and others to help us achieve our national target. </p>  <p>  Businesses too can play their part.

Principally, the Commission identified shortcomings related to the effective control of pelagic fisheries, issues related to underreporting of catches of these species, the inadequate and ineffective sanctioning system for offences committed by operators and the lack of control and enforcement of bluefin tuna catches by recreational vessels. </p>  <p>  The formal administrative inquiry requires Ireland to provide information on these specific findings to enable the Commission to further evaluate Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to apply the rules of the CFP and to assess the potential consequences of any failure to do so.  The Commission will analyse the information provided by Ireland and identify any further steps or actions necessary. The Commission has set the 6th December as the deadline for the submission of the requested information. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have no role in the operational control matters which formed the Audit findings. The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.  The issues arising in the administrative inquiry are operational matters for SFPA and, as Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in these matters. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents clearly prevents the release of documents relating to the administrative inquiry being made public.</p></reply>

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes.  The regulations further prescribe that the inspection process must be fully completed before any payments can issue.</p><p>It is important to note that, in many cases, the existence of an inspection will not necessarily be delaying payment. In relation to the ANC Scheme, this scheme is subject to a range of eligibility and compliance criteria such as the requirement to meet a minimum stocking density in addition to maintaining minimum livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  At this stage, a number of farmers are not eligible to receive payment as they have not met scheme-specific criteria. When an applicant meets these criteria, they will become eligible for payment, which will be processed promptly. Factors that may impact on payment issuing under BPS include, for example, applications to transfer entitlements, request for change in ownership etc., and officials in my Department are actively processing such cases. </p><p>Some 8,000 applicants have been selected for a Land Eligibility inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. Where an application is selected for inspection under any of the area-based schemes, the outcome of that inspection applies to all schemes for which the applicant has applied.</p><p>The following table details the position on Ground and Remote Sensing inspections, as of 25 November, in relation to the BPS/Greening Payment and the ANC/Islands Schemes. I am providing this data at national level as the annual inspection programmes, including the risk analysis selection process, operates on a national basis.

The inspection results for the balance of cases are currently being finalised and will then be advanced through the final stages of processing promptly.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to finalise cases including, Ground and Remote Sensing cases on a daily basis to ensure that BPS payments are issued as quickly as possible. </p><p>Payments under the Protein Aid Scheme, Young Farmers Scheme and the Beef Data and Genomics Programmes are due to commence in early December, therefore detailed data in relation to these schemes is not yet available.</p><p>Advance payments under the Organic Farming Scheme are due to commence this week in respect of cases where all administration checks and validations have been completed. Detailed data is not yet available for these payments.</p><p>There are a total of 328 approved applicants in the Burren Programme. 20 applicants have been selected for inspection, of which 13 have received their advance payment.

My Department and I have been creating and supporting policies to support inshore fishers all around the coast including islands.  The majority of the fishing vessels based on islands are smaller vessels. Inshore fishing boats currently make up more than 80% of the fishing fleet and support an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 jobs. This economic activity is vitally important to the coastal communities around Ireland, including the island communities from which these boats operate. The national and regional forums are supporting initiatives that seek to protect the collective interests of the inshore sector in Ireland including on our islands. The NIFF has been effective in its participation on the Quota Management Advisory Committee, advocating on behalf of all small-scale fishers to influence how Ireland's uptake of quota is achieved.</p>  <p>  In relation to quotas for fish stocks, these are available to small scale coastal fishermen who are licensed to fish for quota stocks including whitefish and pelagic stocks. Catch limits are set for whitefish stocks primarily based on the length of a fishing vessel. On this basis, all vessels under 55 feet in length receive the same catch limit.  The important pelagic stocks of mackerel and herring already have allocations made available that supports inshore vessels. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, quota is a public resource and this policy ensures that quotas do not become a saleable commodity that is bought up by large companies to the detriment of small scales operators, as has happened in other Member States.  The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels which have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities.  This in turn delivers economic activity, including vital employment, in these communities where there are limited alternative economic activities. </p>  <p>  On 21 December 2018, following a full public consultation process, I announced that vessels over 18m length overall will be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020, with a phased reduction of the sprat fishery until 2022. I am mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore sector to fish within this area and with lower environmental impacts.  </p>  <p>  The proportion of landings being foregone by larger vessels will provide opportunities to smaller inshore and island fishermen which would represent a potential increase of 62% in the value of their landings.  Additionally, the increase in availability of sprat and herring (when stocks recover) to smaller vessels will represent a diversification opportunity as these species are found in bays and coastal areas during the winter. </p>  <p>   I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for those fishermen. I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.  </p></reply>

Eighteen months later, 21 beef plants are now approved. The latest CSO trade data for the first nine months of 2019 shows that Ireland exported over 5,000 tonnes of beef to China, some four times the entire volume exported in 2018. This represents a very encouraging start to our beef trade.</p>  <p>  The impact of African Swine Fever (ASF) has created a significant protein deficit in China, which has increased demand and prices for all meats in that market in the short term.</p>  <p>However, my main focus for Irish beef in China is on securing a high-value position for Irish beef that can be maintained in the longer term.  Bord Bia's strategy is to differentiate Irish beef by growing recognition of, and preference for, grass-based, Quality Assured Irish beef in China. These brand building efforts are supported by online and offline promotions targeting trade, chefs and consumers. Equally important is a focus on building durable relationships and developing opportunities for a diverse range of beef cuts in foodservice, retail and e-commerce channels at regional level in China. </p>  <p>  The enthusiasm and interest of Chinese consumers, food companies, leading chefs and food &lsquo;key opinion leaders&rsquo; in the taste and quality of Irish beef was very evident during my recent trade visit to Shanghai and Beijing.</p>  <p>  My Department's role is to open, enhance and maintain meat markets for industry. It is up to industry - with the support of my Department and Bord Bia - to exploit the opportunities created.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-27a.108.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112700047#WRB05500"><p>I congratulate the participants who were involved in the recent Youth Assembly in the Dail and welcome their efforts in highlighting issues relating to Climate Change.  One of their ten recommendations was the development of industrial hemp processing facilities in an effort to provide viable, sustainable and alternative land use for farmers as well as employment in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, current legislation does not allow for the growing of hemp unless a specific licence has been granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) which operates under the auspices of the Department of Health.  In addition, the cultivation of hemp (Cannabis genus) is restricted to varieties having less than 0.2% content of the narcotic compound Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  Cannabis (which includes hemp) is listed in schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, as amended which means it is subject to the strictest level of control. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department concluded a broad consultation, which included relevant bodies/agencies, in an examination of growing hemp commercially. The consultation included the Departments of Health, Justice and Law Reform, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Teagasc and the two representative bodies for Hemp. </p>  <p>  A clear view arising from respondents in the consultation involved in regulation is that the domestic hemp industry should continue to be controlled and regulated by the Department of Health and that the current stringent controls in relation to growing hemp should continue. This strict regulation is in line with the situation in many other countries. </p>  <p>  It is also clear from the consultation, and from meetings officials of my Department have had with industry representatives, that further in-depth research and financial analysis is required to be undertaken by the industry in order to determine if the establishment of processing facilities in Ireland is commercially viable. Currently, there are no processing facilities in Ireland. While my Department remains available to assist the industry, the Deputy should bear in mind that any developments in this area must be industry-led.</p></reply>

While agriculture contributes to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, the sector also has the means to be part of the alleviation process and has a key role to play in transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland's long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector is 'an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production'. </p>  <p>  While carbon neutrality is yet to be fully defined, our policy approach is based on three principles: </p>  <p>  - Reducing agriculture emissions; </p>  <p>  - Increasing carbon sequestration; and </p>  <p>  - The displacement and substitution of fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p>  <p>  Indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and will become even more important in the context of reducing our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030 and decarbonising our energy systems by 2050.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has a 16% target for renewable energy by 2020 and the production of indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping us meet this renewable energy target and my Department has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials in this regard. </p>  <p>  Through the forestry programme, my Department is committed to increasing the supply of biomass from Ireland&rsquo;s forests.  In 2018, 40% of the wood fibre used in Ireland was used for energy generation, mainly within the forest products sector, up from 34% a couple of years ago. This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.</p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018 total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood.</p>  <p>  The Department did previously operate a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production. However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. On-going support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific &ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company operating under the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1998, and, as such, operational matters are the responsibility of the Board and management of the Company. Therefore, neither I nor my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment does not have any statutory function in relation the operation of, or the sourcing of fuel for, electricity generation plants.</p>  <p>   I understand from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment that the decision of the ESB to withdraw the co-firing planning application for Lough Ree Power and to not submit a new co-firing planning application for West Offaly Power is unlikely to alter supply demand estimates for biomass with regard to wood energy  to any great extent.</p></reply>

Croatia as a country in the Western Balkans has important insights to offer on this matter, and it will host a Summit on the region during its Presidency. </p><p>As a fellow small Member State, with a similarly small administration, Ireland understands well the scale of the task involved in undertaking a Presidency, and I offered the Prime Minister my full support and cooperation.</p><p>Whilst in Zagreb I had the opportunity for an extensive range of valuable meetings and discussions with other European leaders principally concerning the next steps on Brexit and the future relationship with the United Kingdom - President of the European Council Donald Tusk, the incoming President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier,<b></b>the 's for the , President Anastasiades of Cyprus, President Iohannis and Prime Minister Orban of Romania, Prime Minister Borissov of Bulgaria, Prime Minister Karins of Lat<font color="#004080">vi</font>a, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mitsotakis of Greece, Prime Minister Solberg of Norway and incoming Chancellor Kurz of Austria. </p><p>I used the Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) to travel to Zagreb.

This is a commitment which the Taoiseach reiterated in June of this year during his visit to Manchester for the British-Irish Council. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new consulate will cover the entire North of England, including major population centres such as Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle. This broadly matches the area known as the &ldquo;Northern Powerhouse,&rdquo; an area with a population of c. 15 million people.  A decision on the optimum location for this new consulate will be taken in due course. </p>  <p>  Additionally, it is worth noting that, since the UK referendum on EU membership in 2016, the Government has committed increased resources to our Embassy in London, already the largest bilateral Embassy in our network. These resources have come from both this Department and from several other Government Departments in order to ensure the Embassy's optimal engagement across all relevant policy areas. It is envisaged that the Embassy in London will continue to expand in order to  support the bilateral relationship and to promote and protect Irish interests across every sector in a post-Brexit context. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also well represented across the devolved regions.  In Scotland, the Irish Consulate in Edinburgh continues to be active in promoting and protecting Irish interests, driving a substantive programme of Scottish-Irish cooperation and exchanges.  In addition, our footprint has also been re-established in Wales, where the Consulate in Cardiff re-opened in April of this year, with a political and economic focus.  </p>  <p>  From an FDI perspective, the UK is, and will continue to be, a very important source market for Ireland.  It will continue to be the largest market for many of our exports, and the place in which many thousands of our diaspora continue to live, study, and work.  It is a priority of this Government to ensure that these deep and positive relationships continue to be maintained and strenghtened at every level in the coming years.</p></reply>

A key focus of these visits is the identification and correction of misclassified employments. To give an overview of the scale of activity, the following table sets out the numbers of sites visited, persons interviewed and numbers that were newly registered for tax or whose status was reclassified from sub-contractor to employee for the years 2016 to 2018. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Site Visits</th>       <th>Persons<br /><br />Interviewed</th>       <th>Reclassifications</th>       <th>New PAYE<br /><br />Registrations</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>2,126</td>       <td>11,699</td>       <td>345</td>       <td>848</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1,816</td>       <td>10,083</td>       <td>484</td>       <td>723</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1,795</td>       <td>8,305</td>       <td>258</td>       <td>492</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of reclassifications between public and privately funded sites, I am advised by Revenue that while it operates its inspection programmes across all areas of construction, it does not capture information on the funding models or tenders involved as this is not relevant to the employment status or tax treatment of the workers operating on site. For this reason, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested.</p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that it does not capture information on the ratio of reclassified employees versus overall numbers of employees or in regard to sub-contractors versus employees because this data quickly fluctuates throughout the life-cycle of site projects.</p><p>I am further advised that it has not been Revenue&rsquo;s practice to develop estimates of PRSI foregone in these cases as the focus is on establishing the correct classification and tax and PRSI treatment for the individuals concerned. I can, however, confirm that during the three years 2016, 2017 and 2018, compliance interventions carried out in the construction sector generated a combined tax and PRSI yield of &euro;54.7million, &euro;60.2 million and &euro;50.6 million respectively, representing a total yield of &euro;165.5 million for those three years.</p><p>Finally, I am advised that site visits are generally conducted on an unannounced basis, particularly where Revenue believes there is a significant risk of employment misclassification.</p></reply>

They are, though, keenly aware of the issues and concerns of those that may be affected by the outcome of the review. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fact that we are coming closer to the date on which any changes on foot of the review are due to be implemented, I have, as I committed previously to do, written to Revenue seeking a factual update on the review. Once this process of engagement with Revenue has been completed, I will be in a position to comment further on the matter, and conscious of the timeline involved, I anticipate that I will be able to do so very shortly.</p></reply>

The significant further lessening of PSPR occurring under the 2017 Act means that:</p>  <p>  - as of 1 January 2019 all pensions up to &euro;39,000 per annum are exempt from PSPR, and</p>  <p>  - from 1 January 2020, all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR. </p>  <p>  For more recent retirees (February 2012 - 1 April 2019), no pension with a value of up to &euro;60,000 per annum has been subject to PSPR since 1 January 2019, and those who retired after 1 April 2019 are not subject to PSPR at all. This implies that only those pre-March 2012 pensions that are linked to salary rates of a minimum amount of &euro;108,000 per annum, or &euro;120,000 per annum for the February 2012-1 April 2019 retiree group, will bear any persisting PSPR impact from 1 January 2020 on. When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, the changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - will be entirely free from PSPR. </p>  <p>  Section 27 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 Act provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will, no later than 31 December 2020, make an order which will specify a date for the full removal of PSPR from that residual group of PSPR-affected pensions. Accordingly, the date specified in the order will effectively be the date for the complete abolition of PSPR.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

In 2014, 14.6% of the working-age population had an education attainment of less than lower secondary. By the end of 2018 this figure had decreased to 11.8%.  The target for end 2020 in the National Skills Strategy is 7% and despite the steady improvement in the figures it is unlikely to be achieved.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;800m is invested annually in the further education and training (FET) sector, and literacy and numeracy is a key component of all FET programmes. Within the overall investment in FET, some &euro;35 million is spent annually on dedicated adult literacy programmes.  Dedicated adult literacy programmes are part time and mostly accredited at levels 1 to 3 of the National Framework of Qualifications.  While growing participation in these programmes should enable pathways into the higher level accredited provision required to contribute the achievement of the National Skills Strategy target, it will not in itself deliver the required outcome.  It should also be noted that there has been no decline in the numbers of beneficiaries of adult literacy provision.  There has been an increase of over 4,000 beneficiaries taking part in adult literacy programmes, from 60,800 in 2018 to 65,000 in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The delivery and enhancement of adult literacy and numeracy provision is being driven through the implementation of the Further Education and Training (FET) Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which is contained in the FET Strategy 2014-19. My Department, along with SOLAS, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and partner agencies are collaborating on the ongoing development and enhancement of the structures required to progress its implementation. The strategy sets out 12 inter- related elements which aim to promote, develop and encourage literacy and numeracy skills in the adult population.  </p>  <p>  As well as dedicated literacy programmes, there is also a focus on supporting integrated literacy and numeracy on all FET programmes. Transversal skills, such as literacy and numeracy, form part of the QQI award standards in the FET sector.  As the intergenerational benefit of Family Learning offers significant impacts to both the adult learner and the child, Good Practice Guidelines Family Literacy in ETBs have been developed over the last year and will roll out in 2020. </p>  <p>  Building on the substantial level of adult literacy and numeracy education already delivered in the FET sector, my Department has focused increasingly in recent years on the needs of vulnerable people in employment.  Initiatives such as Skills to Advance and the EXPLORE programme offer targeted support for employees in lower skilled jobs who need to adapt to a changing work environment. These initiatives are also a significant part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; national efforts to implement the European Commission's Upskilling Pathways Recommendation: New Opportunities for Adults, which aims to help adults acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills and gain accreditation at levels that will contribute to delivering on the National Skills Strategy targets.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  For school planning purposes Johnstown Bridge is located in the Longwood school planning area and Kilshanroe is located in the Edenderry school planning area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new 500 pupil post-primary school for Enfield (Kilcock school planning area) to be established in 2020.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the school planning area where they have sufficient places, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.  </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) closed for parental preferences on the 4th October 2019 for the six post-primary schools to be established in 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputy. It is anticipated that the successful patrons will be announced in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The school will open in September 2020 in suitable interim accommodation pending delivery of its permanent building.</p></reply>

And capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020.</p><p>I can confirm that an overall investment of &euro;46 million has been agreed by Government between 2016 and 2021.  &euro;10 million was made available for the Garda fleet this year.  A further &euro;9million will be provided next  year as part of an overall investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>It is important to be clear that under Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He is responsible for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources, in light of operational demands.  This includes responsibility for allocation of Garda vehicles.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access, regardless of their geographic location or status as either an independent retailer or as part of a larger chain of providers.</p>  <p>  The regulations governing the current pharmacy fee structure were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and are set to expire at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations must be replaced on 1 January 2020 to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. The fees to be set are determined by the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  In keeping with my obligations under Section 43 of the 2017 Act, Department of Health officials have begun a process of consultation with the IPU, as the representative body, prior to the introduction of new fee regulations. My officials have met with an IPU delegation on two occasions and a detailed submission was received from the IPU on 8 November.</p>  <p>  That submission is currently being considered by my Department in the context of the statutory fee-setting process as referred to.</p>  <p>  In May of this year I addressed the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at the National Pharmacy Conference and gave a commitment to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) with a view to optimising the role of pharmacists in the years ahead. It is my intention to open contract discussions in 2020 which will assist to deliver on the commitment given.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 36 new drugs and newly licensed indications for existing drugs for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.</p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p></reply>

This allows an appropriately trained non-medical person or a pharmacist to supply and administer specified prescription-only medicines, without a prescription, to an individual for the purpose of saving life or reducing severe distress in emergency situations.</p><p>The medicines that are included in this initiative are:- adrenaline auto-injectors (epipens) (for the treatment of anaphylaxis), glyceryl trinitrate (for the treatment of unstable angina), salbutamol<b></b>(for the treatment of asthma attacks), glucagon (for the treatment of diabetic hypoglycaemia), naloxone<b></b>(for the treatment of opioid overdose) and medical gas mixture consisting of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen (for the management of severe pain when used by emergency rescue organisations e.g. mountain rescue teams). </p><p>These provisions are contained in S. I. No.  449 of 2015 which amended the Prescription Regulations to allow these prescription-only medicines to be administered by trained members of the public in emergency situations. In order for an organisation, which can include schools, workplaces and other public places, to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, members of that organisation must complete an approved course of training regarding the administration of such medicines and the management of any adverse reaction. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) has established a framework for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer this medicine to those urgently requiring care.</p><p>It is important to note that there is nothing to prevent a person with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis who has been prescribed an Epipen from carrying their prescribed medication with them at all times, in fact this personal action is strongly recommended. This is particularly important for persons at risk of an acute medical emergency, such as an anaphylactic attack. </p><p>Furthermore, medicines legislation permits any person to administer any medicine to another person in accordance with the directions of a registered medical practitioner. Therefore, if a person has been prescribed a medicine, but is unable to administer it to themselves, such as in the case of an overdose, there is no legal impediment to another person administering that medicine to the patient. {Regulation 4A(1)(c) of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended) (S.I. No. 540 of 2003)].</p></reply>

The management of the cases transferred to the SCA when the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013 (S.I. no 405 of 2013) was signed by the then Taoiseach on 15 October 2013.  As such, I have no role as regards the conduct of this or future cases, including as regards the issue of costs relating to them. </p>  <p>  However, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to &ldquo;put in place a scheme, on a no-fault basis, that will respond to the needs of people with disability arising from vaccination" and work is progressing with regard to this.  An Expert Group was established in June of last year, under Judge Meenan, to examine the law in relation to personal injuries arising in the healthcare context and to explore alternative mechanisms by which claims could be managed more effectively, particularly from the perspective of the person on whose behalf a claim has been made.  A report from this Expert Group is expected in the coming weeks, the recommendations of which will be taken into account as part of the development of any possible vaccine compensation scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Health Research Board recently completed a review of the evidence on vaccine injury redress programmes in other jurisdictions and this report will also be considered in conjunction with the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations.</p></reply>

Reducing emissions by water table manipulation has the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions from these soils and is a means to positively contribute to our climate change mitigation ambitions. This is an important part of Agriculture's contribution to the emission reductions and is set out in the All of Government Climate Action Plan released in June 2019.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan targets at least 40,000 hectares of carbon rich soils (peatlands) under agricultural management to maintain low management intensity as part of our commitment. There is great potential for paludiculture to take advantage of this and generate sustainable production benefits without diminishing their environmental functions. The assessment of potential options for land use management of rewetted organic soils and research on the potential for productive use of rewetted peatlands, including paludiculture, are key actions within the Climate Action Plan for the better management of peatlands ands soils. </p>  <p>  Balancing between reducing our own footprint and commit­ting to carbon removal through sequestration, be it afforestation or management of farmed peatlands, etc., is critical. This is the reason for the &euro;3 million that has been assigned to my Department to carry out pilot projects in respect of carbon removal, which will include at its forefront a pilot measure on farmed peatland management.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Bord na M&oacute;na are also focusing on peatlands rehabilitation. The company&rsquo;s rehabilitation principles have always been to re-wet peat where possible and to work in tandem with nature. Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s cutaway rehabilitation will mean that a heterogeneous mosaic of habitats will develop on the cutaway.  </p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has already rehabilitated 15,000 hectares of peatland and is developing new plans that will involve the enhanced rehabilitation of a greater area of peatland by 2025. Bord na M&oacute;na has recently announced a &euro;1.6 billion investment plan which includes an accelerated peatland rehabilitation programme and while these activities will take place on non-agricultural soils my Department will be eager to learn from the knowledge gained by Bord na M&oacute;na's efforts in this area.</p></reply>

This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.</p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018, total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood. </p>  <p>  The Department previously operated a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production.  However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. Ongoing support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific  &ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed. </p></reply>

Interest in planting has increased year-on-year since the commencement of the programme in 2015.</p><p>In order to further encourage the planting of native woodlands, my Department has launched a Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) initiative. This provides an opportunity for businesses to partner with the Government and Irish landowners to support the national effort to plant additional native trees. The WEF involves an additional once off top up payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare paid by the business to the landowner. There has been a positive reaction from the business community to this scheme, with An Post and Accenture already signed up and other businesses submitting formal expressions of interest in participating in the scheme. My colleague Minister Doyle, will be addressing a gathering of interested businesses on 28 November 2019 to further promote the planting of native woodland under the WEF.  </p><p>Furthermore, last month, my colleague Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I announced that Coillte Nature and Bord na M&oacute;na are collaborating on a new project which will see bogs that are no longer being used for peat production, transformed into rich native woodlands.</p><p>This initiative will see approximately 3 million native trees being established, mainly through the direct seeding method, across 1,500 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na land over the next 3 years.  The focus will be on growing a mix of native Irish trees such as Downy Birch, Scots Pine, Alder and other broadleaves (Hazel and Holly etc.).  The Bord na M&oacute;na lands identified for the project are in counties Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and Tipperary.  Teams from Coillte Nature and Bord na M&oacute;na  will work together to provide the management, forestry, nursery and technical expertise to establish and maintain the woodlands. </p><p>A target of 450 hectares of native woodland is set for each year under the current Forestry Progamme 2014 -2020. This would equate to an estimated 1,485,000 trees.  Targets for 2021 and 2022 will be set under the new Forestry Programme.</p><p>In terms of the number of trees planted in each of the years 2007 to 2018, an estimate is shown in the table at the link, using the average figure of 3,300 stems per hectare for native woodlands. The figures from 2015 onwards are based on native woodland establishment under GPCs 9 and 10 under the current National Forestry Programme. There are also native and broadleaf trees planed as part of a mixed plantation. </p><p>  ">Native Woodland Trees</p></reply>

There are three strands to my Department&rsquo;s approach to carbon neutrality:</p>  <p> 1. reducing agricultural emissions;</p>  <p> 2. increasing carbon sequestration; and </p>  <p> 3. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.</p>  <p>  The All-of-Government Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption sets a series of step-up measures and underpinning actions and proposed targets for all sectors including the agriculture, forestry and land use sector. One of these is to achieve 26.8 Mt CO2eq abatement through LULUCF actions, including the planting of 8,000 ha of forestry per annum. My Department is fully committed to mobilising the LULUCF credits as outlined in the &lsquo;All of Government action plan for climate change&rsquo;. To achieve these challenging targets, it will require immediate action through early adoption and high levels of take-up of the identified actions across our 139,000 plus family farms.</p>  <p>  These credits provide a means to assist the agricultural sector contributing to Irelands ambition on climate action.</p>  <p>  Forestry provides resources for the bioenergy supply chain, the wider bio-economy and timber products that can act as a less carbon-intensive substitute of other materials in construction and other related sectors as well as through the displacement of fossil fuels. Ireland has a 16% target for renewable energy by 2020 and the production of indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping us meet this renewable energy target. My Department has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials for the renewable energy sector and continues to make considerable investment to support indigenous biomass supply through the afforestation programme.</p>  <p>  The mid-term review of the Forestry Programme has seen substantial increases in the grants and premiums paid for growing trees suitable for fibre and biomass. The duration of the premium has also increased from 10 to 15 years. It is hoped that these measures will stimulate increased planting of crops such as eucalyptus and poplar which together with forest thinnings will provide increased material for energy.</p>  <p>  My Department is considering all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme.</p></reply>

The area of land under organic production has expanded dramatically as a direct result of my Department's investment. Latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.</p><p>As a further vote of confidence in the organics sector by this Government, my colleague Minister Doyle established an Organics Strategy Group last year comprising relevant stakeholders and state bodies. Part of the remit of the Strategy Group was to consider the case for a possible re-opening of the Organic Farming Scheme. They recommended that it should be re-opened but on a targeted basis. The sectors targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  This recommendation acknowledged that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p><p>The Scheme was opened for applications up to the 19 December 2018 and a total of 225 applications were received. A total of 58 applications were either withdrawn or were deemed ineligible.  Following the ranking and selection process, one applicant withdrew, 55 were successful and 111 farmers received letters informing them that they had been unsuccessful.  All unsuccessful applicants were given a right of appeal to the Organic Unit of my Department. It should be noted that in 95% of the unsuccessful applications, the predominant enterprises were not from the targeted sectors<b></b>identified when the Scheme was launched.</p><p>It is important to note that this was a targeted re-opening and that I fully expect that there will be a new Organics Scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process. </p></reply>

The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU. These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Commission to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products. Checks for products of animal origin numbered 2,858 in 2018 and 2,898 to date in 2019. All consignments are documentary and identity checked and physical checks, including sampling of products, are carried out according to European regulations.  </p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks from January 1st 2020. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  </p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2019, which was published last week, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 35 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2019. This number has grown every year since 2013. This, in turn, leads to the number of stocks being over-fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 13 in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The preparation for the 2019 December Fisheries Council is well underway.  At the December Council, quotas for 2020 will be negotiated on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. From the initial proposal, I am pleased that the scientific advice supports increases in a number of stocks of importance to Ireland such as Haddock, Monkfish and Megrims in the Celtic Sea.  This shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures are paying off.  </p>  <p>  Provided we can successfully navigate the potential difficulties arising from Brexit, in cooperation with our EU27 partners, I am confident that, through the CFP, we will be able to ensure the sustainability of our fish stocks and, in turn, the economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

Irish poultry production is on course to exceed the 100 million mark in 2019.</p>  <p>  The market access process can be lengthy one and is largely determined by the requirements of importing countries. My Department&rsquo;s priorities in this regard are decided in consultation with stakeholders and opportunities for poultry meat exports to a number of third country markets, including Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia are currently being pursued. Earlier this year, agreement was reached with the South African authorities on a revised veterinary health certificate for the export of poultry meat permitting the use of marinades/sauces of non-animal origin. The South African authorities also agreed a separate bilateral certificate for the export of butter-basted whole turkeys from Ireland. </p>  <p>  While the outlook for the sector remains broadly positive, the sector continues to face challenges particularly the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. In this context, the pursuit and development of new markets is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by the market development theme of Food Wise 2025. As in other meat sectors, global trade conditions will be crucial in determining the outlook for the Irish poultry sector over the medium to longer term. </p></reply>

In the year 2000, nearly 11,000 herds endured a bTB restriction while 40,000 reactors were identified. Now, Ireland has approximately 3,800 herds experiencing bTB outbreaks each year, with around 17,000 cattle declared reactors annually. </p>  <p>  This period of rapid improvement in bTB incidence coincided with the implementation of a modern IT disease-management system and the implementation of a wildlife programme. While bTB levels overall are historically lower than ever, since 2016 there has been a gradual increase in disease trends. This  highlight the need for the Programme to continuously adapt as factors influencing disease transmission change. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s TB eradication Programme aims to drive bovine TB disease levels down towards the target of eradication by 2030. It is focussed on measures which will further reduce transmission of bTB. In the coming weeks, I will be launching a renewed strategy underpinned by the principle of supporting and empowering farmers to reduce the bTB risk to their cattle by making informed choices to protect their herd and their neighbour&rsquo;s herds. Equally, there is a particular focus on assisting herdowners whose herds are affected with bTB and to clear their herds of infection. </p>  <p>  Stakeholders have recognised that further preventative measures are required if the ambition of eradication by 2030 is to be achieved. Steadily reducing the risk of disease transmission is the best way in which support can be provided to all Irish farmers &ndash; those whose herds are impacted by bTB and those whose herds are clear and who wish to remain free of the disease. The recommendations made by the bTB Stakeholders Forum have informed the development of this strategy, and stakeholder involvement and leadership will continue to be critical to successfully eradicating bTB.</p>  <p>  The risks associated with each potential transmission channel will be reduced through a series of coordinated measures, which will be applied in addition to the existing programme and in full compliance with the EU requirements for bTB eradication. </p>  <p>  While the strategy is still be being finalised, some of it central themes will be:</p>  <p>  1. Reducing the spread of bTB via cattle to cattle transmission.</p>  <p>  2. Reduce transmission at the cattle/wildlife interface</p>  <p>  3. Improving farmers' understanding of risk with clearer communication</p>  <p>  4. Greater stakeholder leadership, ownership and involvement; and</p>  <p>  5. Continually improve programme effectiveness through review and amendments</p>  <p>  In addition where higher levels of bTB are occurring in certain areas, my Department will put in place High Intensity TB action plans to address the risks and reduce disease spread. My Department has already implemented a High Intensity TB plan in the Cavan/Monaghan area and a similar plan is currently being rolled out in certain DEDs in County Clare.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to develop and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the five cross-cutting themes of environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation and human capital.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, believed that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. </p>  <p>  In July 2019, I launched the fourth annual progress report of Food Wise 2025, Steps to Success 2019. This showed that by 2018, estimated exports had increased by almost 20%, primary production increased by over 13% and the sector&rsquo;s value addition to the economy was over 24% compared to the baseline. </p>  <p>  As of quarter 2 2019, of the 376 detailed actions which were due to commence by 2019 or are ongoing actions; 87% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken and the remainder have commenced and are progressing well. </p></reply>

Up to 15th November 2019, 802 loans have been approved of which 212 to the value of approx. &euro;46.6m have been sanctioned and 37 of these, to the value of &euro;9.5m, relate to food businesses.</p>  <p>  - the DBEI/DAFM &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; will make up to &euro;300 million of long-term strategic investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. Businesses have been able to apply for loan eligibility through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) since 17th April 2019.  As of 15th November 2019, 1,906 loans are approved of which 683 are farmers, and 227 are food companies.  Of these, 592 loans to the value of &euro;120m have been sanctioned, and of these 592 loans, 283 are farmers with a total sanction amount of &euro;32.7m, and 56 are food companies for a value of &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  - A market prioritisation exercise undertaken by Bord Bia to identify priority markets across all food and drinks categories;</p>  <p>  - tailored supports and analysis are being provided to food companies through Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer;</p>  <p>  - an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets has taken place.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, the Government announced that it will provide a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; contingency fund to support our most vulnerable sectors, with up to &euro;650 million available overall, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts of Brexit emerge.  &euro;110 million will be made available for the agri-food sector in the first tranche, to be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU.</p>  <p>  The provision of immediate supports for our beef sector will be a first priority, as will support for our fishing fleet. We also want to support food companies to re-orient towards new products and markets, and to support other sectors to improve their competitiveness.</p>  <p>  While supports cannot fully address the negative effects of a no-deal for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, this first tranche of supports will be used to ameliorate the immediate impact on farmers and fishermen, as the full impact of a no-deal Brexit crystallises, and to make some of the adjustments needed to improve resilience for businesses in the face of new market realities.  Of course, we await  developments in the UK over the coming weeks, which will determine whether a no-deal exit is likely at the end of January 2020.</p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with industry on an ongoing basis, my Department recently conducted a final public consultation to close the mapping exercise in advance of the award of the NBP contract. Over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public. </p>  <p>  The European Commission approved the NBP under state law and confirmed that the NBP target areas where no broadband infrastructure offering download speeds of at least 30MB/s is currently in place, and where no private investor has demonstrated a concrete plan to invest commercially in the near future. </p>  <p>  Having evaluated the submissions received, approximately 38,000 premises were removed from the intervention area as commercial operators provided evidence that these premises can now access a high speed broadband service from an existing network. These premises relate to network deployment detailed in submissions received from eir (34,000 premises) regarding its fibre rural network and SIRO (4,000 premises) as part of its wider fibre network rollout, which were evaluated as meeting the assessment criteria published by the Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 37,000 premises originally identified as being served by commercial operators have now been included in the intervention area for the NBP, as commercial operators' plans to serve these premises have not materialised.</p>  <p>  The map has also been updated for approximately an additional 2,000 premises identified in the latest Ordinance Survey Ireland data. The final Intervention Area now covers 537,596 premises.</p></reply>

However, the cost of insulating homes can vary significantly from property to property. Key factors which determine the cost include the type of insulation required, the size of the property and whether there is any existing insulation to be upgraded.</p>  <p>  If the existing grant was increased to meet 100% of the cost, it is estimated that the additional full-year (2018) costs would have been approximately &euro;20 million, solely based on the grants paid for attic and wall insulation in 2018. However, it would be expected that actual costs of the proposal would be significantly higher due to increased demand arising from the provision of a 100% grant instead of a 30% grant. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 home retrofits to Building Energy Rating &lsquo;B2&rsquo; by 2030.

The table contains my Department's most up to date statistics, which are for Q3 2019.</p><p>Information on the specific towns referred to by the Deputy are available on the High Speed Broadband Map on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie. </p><p>The Blue area is where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The NBP defines high speed broadband as delivering a minimum speed of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload in a reliable, high quality and consistent manner. Premises in the Blue area may access a high speed broadband service via various platforms including fibre, many exceeding the definition of high speed broadband. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The regulator publishes a quarterly report which highlights trends in the telecommunications industry. This includes the number of subscriptions in Ireland to high speed broadband services by speed (e.g. download speeds of 30 megabits per second) and by platform (fibre, cable, VDSL etc.). The latest report can be found at </p><p>Very high speeds are increasingly available across all fixed broadband platforms. Per the ComReg report approximately 79.6% of broadband subscriptions were &amp;gt;=30Mbps (with 33.1% &amp;gt;=100Mbps). This equates to approximately 81.5% (with 35.4% &amp;gt;=100Mbps) of residential subscriptions and 64.0% (with 14.6% &amp;gt;=100Mbps) of business subscriptions. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Premises withinthe NBP InterventionArea </th>       <th>Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th>       <th>Premises withineir planned ruraldeployment</th>       <th>Amber %</th>       <th>Blue % </th>       <th>Light Blue %</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>12,145</td>       <td>597,112</td>       <td>203</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>609,460</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>8,245</td>       <td>53,085</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>61,556</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>18,989</td>       <td>67,609</td>       <td>396</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>86,994</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>13,329</td>       <td>79,837</td>       <td>260</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>93,426</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>14,871</td>       <td>50,415</td>       <td>144</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>65,430</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>78,695</td>       <td>190,231</td>       <td>2,279</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>271,205</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>21,024</td>       <td>76,019</td>       <td>844</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>97,887</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>14,876</td>       <td>47,028</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>61,990</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>38,338</td>       <td>95,951</td>       <td>1,444</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>135,733</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>14,809</td>       <td>25,143</td>       <td>187</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>40,139</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>18,092</td>       <td>29,973</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>48,155</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan identifies a number of provisions to be incorporated in the new Bill including:</p><p>- Establishing the 2050 target in law</p><p>- Making the adoption of carbon budgets a legal requirement</p><p>- Requiring the Government to set a decarbonisation target range for each sector, with the Minister with primary responsibility for each sector identified as being accountable for delivering the relevant actions to meet the sectoral targets</p><p>- Establishing the Climate Action Council as a successor organisation to the Climate Change Advisory Council</p><p>- Establishing that the Climate Action Plan shall be updated annually</p><p>- Establishing that a Long-Term Climate Strategy, to match the period covered by the three five-year carbon budgets, shall be published</p><p>- Ensuring that the proposed governance arrangements retain sufficient flexibility to allow necessary reorientation of policy in the light of changing technologies, circumstances, challenges and opportunities over the period to 2030 and beyond.</p><p>The General Scheme is currently being prepared on the basis of the provisions outlined above with a view to publication of the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill in quarter 1, 2020 as committed to under the Plan.</p><p>In parallel to work on the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill 2019, my Department is also in the process of preparing Ireland&rsquo;s Long-Term Strategy to meet the requirements set out under Article 15 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. This strategy will have a perspective of at least 30 years and shall include a range of emission reduction pathways to further illuminate, in each of our key sectors, what changes will be required.</p><p>Alongside the Bill and Long Term Strategy, the Climate Action Plan commits to evaluating in detail the changes required to adopt a more ambitious commitment of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as part of finalising Ireland&rsquo;s long-term climate strategy. A public consultation has been launched on the Long Term Strategy by my Department. Further details are available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

This includes policy in relation to energy security, which is fully aligned with EU law and EU policy objectives. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has statutory functions relating to energy security, for both gas and electricity, and is independent in the exercise of its functions. These include functions in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as amended, to promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. CRU also is required by S.I. 60/2005 to monitor, and take such measures as it considers necessary to protect, the security of supply of electricity. In relation to gas, the CRU also has a statutory function to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas. The CRU is also the designated competent authority for Ireland, for EU Regulation 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of supply of gas. </p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency has statutory responsibility in relation to the storage of oil stocks for use in an emergency, at a level sufficient to comply with the State&rsquo;s stockholding obligations. </p>  <p>  The transmission system operators for gas and electricity, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, have legal responsibilities in relation to gas and electricity security. The electricity transmission system operators are responsible for, inter alia, ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity, and contributing to security of supply through adequate transmission capacity and system reliability. The gas transmission system operators are required, inter alia, to operate, maintain and develop under economic conditions secure, reliable and efficient transmission facilities to secure an open market, with due regard to the environment.</p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with State Agencies and other stakeholders, including Gas Networks Ireland and the ESB, as part of the normal process of feeding into policy development and formulation. </p>  <p>  In relation to energy sustainability and security, I am initiating a major review into Ireland's energy sustainability and security which will:</p>  <p>  -  Consider the optimal actions that need to be taken, in reaching 70% renewable electricity, to ensure Ireland's electricity system is backed up in a secure, safe and sustainable way. </p>  <p>  -  Assess the role of gas during the transition, as the lowest CO2 emitting fossil fuel, and consider how and from where it is sourced. </p>  <p>  -  Review the role that other technologies can play in the transition, including battery storage, pumped storage, the role of interconnection (both gas and electricity) and the possibilities for hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). </p>  <p>  -  Consider what the roadmap for renewable electricity looks like in the period from 2030 to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050</p>  <p>  The review that I have initiated into Ireland's energy security and sustainability will be carried out by an independent body following a public procurement exercise. In advance of commissioning the review, </p>  <p>  I have written to the Chairperson of EirGrid, ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na, Ervia and CRU to seek their views on the challenges involved in making the transition to a carbon neutral economy. </p></reply>

These relate to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the associated Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. The LULUCF Regulation includes an alignment of land use categories with those reported to the UNFCCC and brings the LULUCF sector into the European Union&rsquo;s 2030 climate policy framework more directly by including a link between the Effort Sharing Regulation (Regulation 2018/842) and land use accounting. This Regulation forms parts of the implementation of the European Union&rsquo;s commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Due to certain specificities and the complex nature of this sector, the LULUCF sector is treated differently to other sectors under the European Union&rsquo;s climate framework policy. The LULUCF Regulation requires Member States to ensure that accounted emissions from land use are entirely compensated by equivalent accounted removals from the atmosphere through action in the sector, i.e. to ensure that there are no net accounted emissions from those sectors. This obligation covers all managed land use categories in the territory of Ireland and requires the State to account for emissions and removals from both State-owned land and privately-owned land, including forests. Ireland and other EU Member States may employ a capped amount of total accounted removals, in excess of the no net emissions obligation, to meet targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. It is also possible for Member States to use annual emissions allocations under the Effort Sharing Regulation to meet their obligations under the LULUCF Regulation. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National Inventory Report, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, details the methodologies followed in developing estimates of emission and removals for LULUCF. The latest report can be found here: . </p><p>A carbon credit generally refers to an accounting unit in an international agreement or a regulatory or voluntary market and does not refer to a universally traded asset. There is no inherent private property right to greenhouse gas emissions or removals by forests or other land uses, whether on lands held by the State or privately owned. The State supports the long-term greenhouse gas store in the forest estate through regulation and financial incentives for forest planting and sustainable management, such as the afforestation grant and premium scheme. Land owners may choose to pursue voluntary initiatives outside of such subsidies that do not impact on the State&rsquo;s reporting and accounting obligations.</p></reply>

By the closing date, 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. This was the highest number of applications ever received.  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. 619 "equipment only" applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May. All unsuccessful "equipment only" applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the decision.  The final allocations for capital works were announced earlier this month with a total of &euro;39.5m allocated to 1,009 projects.  </p>  <p>  In relation to these latest allocations, my Department will shortly be in contact with all of these applicants with full details of the outcome of the assessment process.  All unsuccessful applicants will be invited to appeal the Department's decison if they believe that their application was not correctly assessed according to the published assessment manual.</p></reply>

A High Level Summit - &ldquo;Nairobi Summit on ICPD25: Accelerating the Promise&rdquo;, 12 to 14 November 2019 &ndash; was convened by the Governments of Kenya and Denmark, together with UNFPA, to mark the 25 years since Cairo.

There are two rights at play, the right to identity and the right to privacy, and legislation must seek to harmonise these rights. However, I fully recognise this advice is contrary to the desire of advocates for unrestricted access to identity information and to birth certificates.  </p>  <p>  During the summer, I held a number of consultations with Members of the Oireachtas and with stakeholder groups, to seek to reach a consensus which will allow the legislation to progress. More recently, I have consulted further in relation to a number of specific options for progressing the Bill.  I am now considering the responses I have received, and I hope to be in a position to revert to Oireachtas members and stakeholders shortly.</p></reply>

To this end, I visited Sligo earlier this year with a multi-disciplinary team from my Department to meet with a similar delegation from Sligo. The Council has ambitious plans itself and my Department is working with the Council to support their achievement. In this regard, as a follow up to the Sligo meeting, we have put Sligo forward to participate in the Joint Assistance to Support Regions programme, under the auspices of the European Investment Bank, which will, inter alia, help maximise the potential of the &euro;8.5m allocated to Sligo by my Department under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund.</p>  <p>  As regards funding, the elected members have direct responsibility for adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority. It is a matter for Sligo County Council to manage its resources and determine its own spending priorities having regard to needs and available resources. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department works closely with Sligo County Council in relation to both its financial position and overall staffing requirements.</p>  <p>  Sligo County Council has a financial plan in place and is working towards financial sustainability. In this context, my Department has supported the Council with an additional annual allocation from the Local Government Fund for the years 2014 to 2019 on the basis that agreed targets in the Plan are met. In March 2014, following a meeting with my Department wherein a draft financial plan was submitted, it was decided to provide Sligo County Council with &euro;250,000. However, in the absence of the detailed plan being finally agreed before the end of 2014 it was not possible to make a further payment to Sligo at that time. Subsequently, the financial plan for the years 2015 - 2019 was agreed in late 2015. Sligo County Council advised my Department in early 2017 that the &ldquo;revenue cumulative surplus&rdquo; as profiled in the plan for delivery in the years 2017 onwards was no longer achievable. As a result, the plan was extended, including revised targets, to 2027. </p>  <p>  An additional amount of &euro;1 million had been paid for 2015, 2016 and 2017 but the payment for 2018, was reduced to &euro;200k to reflect the reduced surplus that could be achieved in 2017 based on the information available at the time. As the actual 2017 surplus was ultimately higher than was anticipated by Sligo County Council, a higher payment of &euro;700,000 was made by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  It is therefore, a matter for each individual Chief Executive to apply for sanction from my Department and, once approved, to recruit and assign staff to specific divisions within their organisation.  Staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. My Department is working with Sligo County Council on the staffing requests mentioned in the question.</p>  <p>  Significant additional resources were made available to Sligo County Council in the context of the financial plan, far in excess of additional support to any other local authority. Any further funding for Sligo County Council, will be considered within the overall framework of the Financial Plan. In this regard, Sligo County Council&rsquo;s audited Annual Financial Statement for 2018 is currently under review in order to determine the amount of the next payment. The allocation that will be due when that review is complete will be for use at Sligo County Council's discretion and can be directed towards the costs of establishing a Land Asset Team, if that is the preferred approach. </p></reply>

In consultation with the local authority sector, commercial rates are being re-introduced for Irish Water and from next year, Irish Water will pay commercial rates like other utilities and there will no longer be any general need for compensation in lieu of rates.  </p>  <p>  Based on the valuation, by the independent Commissioner for Valuation, it is expected that overall, the local government sector should collect a broadly similar amount in commercial rates to that previously provided as exchequer funded water rates compensation. However, due to the distribution of the income from Irish Water commercial rates, on the same basis as other utilities, some local authorities will receive less in commercial rates than they received in compensation, with others receiving more. Of the small number of local authorities negatively impacted, it is accepted that Wicklow County Council would be disproportionately impacted by the level of income reduction in the context of its Budget for 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department has monitored the impact of the transition across local authorities and having carefully considered the challenges faced by Wicklow County Council, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and I have agreed the allocation of financial support to Wicklow County Council in the amount of &euro;300,000.</p>  <p>  This level of support will significantly mitigate the impact in 2020.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-27a.743.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112700056#WRL05200"><p>Under the EU Land Use and Forestry Regulation for 2021-2030, EU Member States have to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from land use, land use change or forestry (LULUCF) are offset by at least an equivalent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere during this period. The Regulation implements the agreement between EU leaders in October 2014 that all sectors should contribute to the EU's 2030 emission reduction target, including the land use sector. It is also in line with the Paris Agreement, which points to the critical role of the land use sector in reaching our long-term climate mitigation objectives.</p>  <p>  The primary legislation underpinning the protection and conservation of nature in Ireland are the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2018, the implementation of which falls under the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity. The basic designation for wildlife is the Natural Heritage Area (NHA), an area considered important for the habitats present or which holds species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection. </p>  <p>  73 blanket bogs, covering 37,000ha, are designated as NHAs.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural habitats is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also falls under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. </p>  <p>  Ireland has identified 50 areas as Special Areas of Conservation for the protection of blanket bog. These SACs include lowland and mountain blanket bog areas, predominantly along the western Atlantic seaboard but also widely distributed on upland areas.</p>  <p>  The LULUCF Regulation aims to include managed wetlands, such as blanket bogs, in our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting by 2026. To this end, a working group, including representatives from my Department, has been established by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to formulate how accounting for managed wetlands can be achieved in the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in compliance with the relevant EU legislation. </p>  <p>  Greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), as reported in Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions inventory prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, include activities associated with afforestation and forestry harvesting, grassland and cropland management under agricultural use, managed and unmanaged wetlands, and other land-use categories. While such emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets.</p></reply>

It was intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the Management Plan. </p>  <p>  Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is funded under the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme. The Department is managing this project and is contributing &euro;1.352m, as well as ecological expertise, with the European Commission providing &euro;4.056m.  </p>  <p>  The Living Bog project, which commenced in 2016 and will conclude at the end of 2020, aims to restore the favourable conservation condition and increase the area for active raised bog by 277 hectares on the 12 raised bog special area of conservation project sites in the Border-Midlands-West region.  Restoration works have been completed to date on 6 LIFE project special area of conservation sites.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is undertaking restoration works on State owned lands within the designated raised bog network. </p>  <p>  The raised bog designated sites restoration programme can now be accelerated due to the announcement in Budget 2020 of &euro;5m for peatlands restoration. This funding will allow for restoration measures to be undertaken on approximately 1,800 hectares in 2020 on up to 9 raised bog designated sites across 7 counties and the installation of an Eddy Covariance Flux tower on a representative bog to directly observe the exchanges of gas, energy, and momentum between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. The flux tower will directly measure the carbon, water, and heat flows between plant communities and the atmosphere. A further 23 raised bog designated sites have been identified for restoration works over the next number of years under the programme. </p>  <p>  My Department is part of a consortium with another Government Department, State bodies and other institutions which is considering submitting an EU LIFE programme application in 2020, part of which could include the restoration of a number of raised bogs. </p>  <p>  It is also a partner in an Environmental Protection Agency funded project, led by Trinity College Dublin, that is seeking to quantify carbon emissions from raised bogs across a range of degradation conditions and has part-funded an Eddy Covariance Flux tower at Clara Bog Special Area of Conservation. The Department has also funded the installation of hydrometric stations to measure dissolved carbon in water at this site.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is co-funding a project on the vulnerability of peatland ecosystems to a changing climate and increases in the frequency and severity of droughts as part of the 2019 Environmental Protection Agency research calls, with a budget for the project of up to &euro;300,000. This project is being led by Dublin City University.</p></reply>

The review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This reconfigured network entails:</p>  <p>  1.  The cessation of turf-cutting on 36 existing natural heritage areas, which will remain designated - this includes 7 sites to be divided, with part to be conserved and part de-designated;</p>  <p>  2.  The de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas - including the relevant areas of the 7 sites to be divided - where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal and/or that restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved; and</p>  <p>  3.  The designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure. These sites are to be proposed for designation to make up for the loss of habitat within the natural heritage area sites where turf cutting is to continue.</p>  <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, aims to give legal effect to the proposed reconfiguration of the raised bog natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 review and provides for a review(s) of blanket bog natural heritage areas. The Bill has been presented to and passed by D&aacute;il  &Eacute;ireann and has passed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.
