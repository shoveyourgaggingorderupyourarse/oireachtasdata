This is reflected in the large amount of legislation that has been brought forward in recent years in this area.  In particular, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act 2013 - a major piece of legislation that applies to all animal including greyhounds. This provides for the welfare of all animals and does not just apply to those directly involved in their husbandry but also those involved in the sale or transport of animals or otherwise.</p>  <p>  In the case of greyhounds, there is further specific protection of their welfare set out in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 which makes provisions to ensure their well being. This Act also empowers officers of the Bord na gCon to inspect premises where greyhounds are kept to ensure a suitable standard is maintained. While Bord na gCon has no statutory function regarding the regulation of greyhound exports, nevertheless, it has been very clear that it does not support the export of greyhounds to destinations where the standard of care falls below that required in Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  I have received assurances from Bord na gCon that it is committed to the expansion of its existing &lsquo;Code of Practice in the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound&rsquo; to include advice on best practice when exporting greyhounds. Work on the expanded Code will be finalised when consideration of the Greyhound Industry Bill has been completed by the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with animal welfare charities on the various aspects of animal welfare.  I welcome the initiative of the Dogs Trust in facilitating the International Greyhound Forum, which includes the ISPCA and Bord na gCon. The Forum continues to give consideration to  issues relating to the export of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  I believe that the animal welfare legislation introduced in recent years represents a positive development and has been welcomed by all those who care for animals.</p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth Fishery Harbour Centre. </p>  <p>  The Department appointed a firm of Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project.  A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this classification means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.  </p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. The Department&rsquo;s view is that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken.  It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. </p>  <p>  The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, the consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19th of December 2018.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2019 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, I have allocated &euro;100,000 for the continuation of the preparatory works for a dredging project in Howth as set out above. As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging works project in Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

Agriculture has a key role to play in contributing to meeting these targets.  </p><p>One of my priorities is to ensure Ireland and Irish food producers are playing, and continue to play, a vital and positive role in the protection and enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, waterways, biodiversity and air quality.  In this regard, I launched the 4<sup>th</sup>Nitrates Action Programme (NAP) on the 4<sup>th</sup>December 2017 in cooperation with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, which yielded a package of measures that raises the bar in tackling agricultural impacts on water. A key feature of successive reviews has been focus on maximising the nutrient value of recycled slurry and organic manure, offsetting chemical fertiliser requirement.  <i></i></p><p>The Nitrates Action Programme emphasises the importance of knowledge transfer to ensure that farmers fully understand how best to protect the natural waters on or close to their lands. Furthermore, opportunities for large savings on farms through better grassland management, improved timing and application of fertiliser and the use of Low Emission Spreading Equipment have been taken into account in order to gain efficiencies and maximise the use of our resources.</p><p>In addition, my Department provides a range of supports for diverse farming practices under a number of areas including Horticulture, TAMS (Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes), Organics and GLAS (Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme)</p><p>In order to measure our achievements at both farmer and food business level, Origin Green enables Ireland&rsquo;s food industry to measure our sustainability credentials. For farmers, this involves the participation in Bord Bia&rsquo;s Sustainable Assurance Schemes.</p><p>While continuing to explore the future development of the diverse agri-food sector in Ireland, I will continue to base my policies and approaches on the best science and research available in order to enhance and maximise the continued economic, social and environmental sustainability of our natural resources.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600059#WRB01700"><p>Total Irish agri-food exports to Iran in 2017 were around &euro;11.5 million, the majority of which (&euro;10.25 million) was accounted for by dairy exports. According to the CSO, 26 tonnes of beef were exported to Iran in 2017, but there have been no export of sheepmeat to-date.  </p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities. However, the actual levels of exports will depend on a range of factors, including global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements. </p>  <p>  A veterinary health certificate for the export of beef from Ireland to Iran was agreed in March 2013. DAFM officials participated in a successful trade mission to Iran and Turkey in April 2016. While the trade mission was primarily dairy-focused, DAFM officials had the opportunity to meet with their Iranian counterparts in order to progress and ultimately agree sheepmeat access to the Iranian market and also to explore other common areas of interest.  Access for sheepmeat was officially announced in October 2016. Therefore these markets are open at present but the resumption of exports is a matter for the industry.   </p>  <p>  Limited or no exports of meat to Iran can be explained by a combination of unfavourable trading conditions, cheaper supplies of beef from Brazil and of lamb from Australia to the Iranian market, and financial barriers.  Work is on-going within the EU to devise measures to overcome financial barriers to trade between the EU and Iran.</p></reply>

These include low cost loan schemes to assist in on-farm and agri business cost effectiveness, and additional funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc to support market and product diversification. </p>  <p>  More recently, I have held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the impact of Brexit, including in the margins of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels last week. I again stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, particularly in respect of the beef sector, which will face very serious challenges in the event of the UK proceeding with the kind of tariff arrangements it announced recently. Options here include traditional market supports and exceptional aid provisions under the Common Agricultural Policy's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime my Department, as part of the whole-of-Government approach to Brexit, has been very active in preparing for a potential no-deal Brexit. We have been working with other departments and agencies to have the necessary arrangements in place to carry out import controls at our ports and airports in order to allow the Department to fulfil its legal obligations as efficiently as possible, while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements. </p>  <p>  We have also sharpened our communications to include an enhanced Brexit page on the Department&rsquo;s website, the circulation of focused Trader Notices to the individual agri sectors, the establishment of a Brexit Call Centre and increased use of social media.</p></reply>

It specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcase classification. According to this legislation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week at least twice every three months. The legislation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random. </p>  <p>  Carcase classification controls in slaughter plants are carried out by a dedicated team of specialist staff in the Beef Carcase Classification Section within my Department.  Classification Officers conduct unannounced, on-the-spot inspections in 32 beef slaughtering plants to ensure that Carcase Classification is carried out in accordance with EU Regulations. </p>  <p>  The number of inspections conducted annually significantly exceeds the legal requirement set down in EU legislation.  In 2018, my Department conducted almost 550 inspections.  This is an average of 17 inspections per factory per year, which significantly exceeds the legal requirement of 8 inspections per year.  At each inspection, an average of 85 carcasses were inspected for correct classification and carcase presentation. The legal requirement is 40 carcasses per inspection.  I am satisfied therefore that the existing system significantly exceeds the requirements of the relevant EU Regulations.</p>  <p>  Regarding new technologies, my Department is supervising an industry-led trial which is examining the latest technology in terms of cameras and lights for use in the mechanical classification system. The trial is examining the effectiveness of using digital cameras and LED lights as part of the carcase classification system. This trial is in an advanced stage.  Subject to confirmation of its effectiveness,  I would expect the industry to implement this technology in due course although this is a matter for commercial consideration.  I have also asked my officials to explore the incorporation of factory machine records available on a daily basis, into the controls system. </p></reply>

However, as Minister, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price; cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it. Cattle prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of consumer demand, production levels and exchange rate differences. Brexit also presents enormous challenges and ongoing uncertainty for the entire beef sector.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p>  <p>  While beef farmers obviously benefit from the full range of Pillar I direct payments and Rural Development Programme schemes, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector. This scheme provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. It is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  In addition,  I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible.   Beef farmers will also be significant beneficiaries of the &euro;23m in additional funding provided to the ANC scheme this year. </p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations, which have the potential to help strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.</p></reply>

Apart from the well-known sensitivities in relation to Mercosur beef access to the EU market, other outstanding issues include cars, rules of origin, geographical indications, maritime services and EU dairy access to the Mercosur market.  The next round of negotiations is scheduled for May 2019, with the most recent having taken place in Buenos Aires two weeks ago, again without announcement of any major breakthroughs.</p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, we have been very consistent in urging caution in the approach to these negotiations. Our position has been reiterated many times, for example by myself and by my colleague, Minister Andrew Doyle, at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings, and by other Ministers in the relevant EU Trade policy fora. It has also been done through direct contacts with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstroem, and by the Taoiseach at European Council and through his own direct contacts, including with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron.  I have also been working closely with Member State colleagues in this regard, and have remained in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on the matter.</p>  <p>  In an overall sense there is undoubtedly a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations. I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. I also continue to stress that full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p></reply>

Coillte was established under the Forestry Act 1988 and one of its functions is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices. I have therefore asked Coillte to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to its use of Continuous Cover Forestry practices.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of the benefits of Continuous Cover Forestry which is why I  recently introduced a Continuous Cover Forestry Scheme under the Forestry Programme. This was  a key commitment under the mid-term review of the Programme and was launched as part of a suite of biodiversity measures by my Department recently. I am delighted to say that all the measures have been very well received and that application rates have exceed our expectations.</p>  <p>  Under this Scheme, forest owners receive support for the management of suitable conifer, broadleaf and mixed conifer/broadleaf forests in accordance with this alternative approach.  Under this approach the forest canopy is maintained at one or more levels without clearfelling. </p>  <p>  Continuous Cover Forestry opens up the canopy through thinning enabling more light to reach the forest floor, thereby allowing plants to re-colonise the forest area, increasing biodiversity. In addition, thinning opens up forest areas for walking and other recreational uses and improve the visual amenity of forests. Thinning, by opening up tree crowns to light, also promotes higher levels of tree seed production which favours natural regeneration systems and close-to-nature silviculture.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to note the interest in this Scheme so far.  We already have over half our anticipated applications which augurs well for the success of this important forest management measure.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-food sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards. In 2018, live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to 2017. This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports totalling 58,000 up to early March &ndash; a 35% increase on the same period in 2018.    </p>  <p>  However, I am cognisant of the challenges within the live export trade.</p>  <p>  In terms of ferry capacity, my Department officials continue to meet with operators to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters - however, ultimately it must be recognised that decisions will be made on a commercial basis. With regard to cancelled crossings on account of inclement weather, this, unfortunately, is outside of my control.  </p>  <p>  My officials are in on-going communication with Irish exporters with regard to the need for co-operative management between each other to ensure that the lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  The development of additional lairage capacity is a commercial issue.  The live export sector may wish to consider developing an additional lairage in Cherbourg, or engaging with owners of existing facilities there to explore the potential for additional capacity.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, there has been significant engagement with the French authorities regarding this matter. In September 2018, officials from my Department visited Cherbourg to discuss the capacity issue with the French authorities and local lairage operators. Last month, Bord Bia met with local lairage operators, while Department officials held a meeting with the IFA and French Embassy representatives. </p>  <p>  I also raised the issue last month with the French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian and last week, I discussed the matter with my French counterpart, Didier Guillaume, at the EU Agrifish Council meeting in Brussels.  I should make it clear that the facilitation of the French Ministry relates to the approval of private sector developments.  </p>  <p>  Following this engagement, I am happy to report that, in recent weeks, the French authorities have approved an increase of the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg. This will provide for additional daily capacity for 400 animals. Based on current ferry sailing schedules, this provides increased capacity of some 1,200 animals per week.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to advocate on behalf of our exporters with regard to this issue.</p></reply>

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has made and will continue to make an increasingly significant contribution to the environmental sustainability of the Irish agriculture. One of the priorities of CAP is to protect grasslands and avoid any downward pressure that would negatively change their use. </p><p>In particular farmers are required to comply with the Statutory management requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) provisions, and the agri-environmental measures contained in Rural Development Programmes (RDP). </p><p>The greening elements of CAP and GAEC contribute to protecting soil and landscape carbon pools. Temperate grasslands have the potential to sequester carbon, i.e. act as a carbon sink, helping to mitigate rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>concentrations, therefore potentially contributing to climate change mitigation.</p><p>In addition, measures contained within the RDP-funded Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS), encourage soil management practices that favour carbon sequestration, such as planting of cover crops, tree and minimum tillage practices. For example, almost 26,000 hectares of arable land is planted with catch crops annually which prevents soil erosion and absorbs valuable plant nutrients.  This measure has the capacity to absorb 1.25 million tonnes of nitrogen annually, minimising the need for chemical fertilisers thereby having an environmental and economic benefit.  The carbon sequestration potential of the 5,000 groves of trees planted under GLAS equates to approximately 450 hectares of woodland which is c. 900 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>annually.</p><p>Scientific research also has a central role to play in developing our understanding of the carbon sequestration potential of our natural land resources. My Department recognises the important role that land use plays in mitigating greenhouse gases and is strongly committed to providing funding for targeted research in the area of carbon sequestration.

However, following the successful scientific trialling of badger vaccination, research from UCD concluded that the current TB Eradication Programme has the tools available to achieve eradication. </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in reducing the incidence of TB in cattle in recent years. In the year 2000, 10,785 farmers experienced a TB restriction. In contrast, in 2018 there were 3, 874 herds restricted for TB, a 65% decrease on the year 2000 figures. While this historically low level of TB is very much to be welcomed, the work done in UCD tells us that without some additional measures the estimated timeline for eradication is 60 to 90 years.   </p>  <p>  The impacts of TB on a farmer are severe, causing financial hardship and emotional stress. This is why it is so important to reduce the numbers of farmers affected and to move to eradicate this disease. For that reason, I directed my officials to establish the TB Stakeholder Forum last year, so that all stakeholders can have a voice in discussing which policy options should be chosen to reduce disease levels and eradicate bovine TB from Ireland. Maintaining the status quo, with the addition of badger vaccination will lead to eradication over a 60-90 year period, but the science from UCD suggests that extra measures that could be applied to the programme can bring about eradication in a much shorter time frame. The forum has been tasked with agreeing measures that can further address disease transmission with the objective of achieving eradication by 2030. All stakeholders at the Forum have an opportunity to discuss which choices should be made to reduce TB levels. </p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving a report from the forum in the coming months. </p></reply>

The EU Commission JRC report (2010) found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer in the EU per unit of dairy production, and the fifth most carbon efficient producer per unit of beef. However, inherent challenges remain for the sector in terms of contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and renewable energy targets. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 is a ten-year strategy agreed by a range of stakeholders, both public and private, and adopted by the Government as an overarching policy for the Irish agri-food sector. It underlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and illustrates the potential for further development. </p>  <p>  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across cross-cutting themes including environmental sustainability; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee, which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, believed that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value-added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. </p>  <p>  Food Wise is the latest in a series of strategies that are renewed every five years and preparations for a new strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve: an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agri-food industry; a formal public consultation; and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy. </p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that the cross-cutting themes contained in Food Wise (environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation, and human capital) will continue to be highly relevant. It is likely that environmental sustainability, and in particular the contribution that agriculture can make to climate action, will need significant consideration and prominence. </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently developing an environmental sustainability roadmap for the agri-food sector to ensure that the future development of agriculture and the land-use sector, including forestry, will be built upon and contribute fairly to Ireland&rsquo;s climate  and energy targets. This roadmap will be published later this year and will form a key element of the 2030 strategy. In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile my Department continues to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy.  The recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of measures we need to implement to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector. </p>  <p>  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p></reply>

These measures not only focus on the mitigation of greenhouse gases and improving resource efficiency but are also aimed at restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to building resilience of agricultural production systems (i.e. adaptation).</p>  <p>  The long term vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Our policy approach is based on three principles:</p>  <p>i. reducing agricultural emissions;</p>  <p>ii. increasing carbon sequestration and </p>  <p>iii. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.  </p>  <p>  There are already a significant number of measures in place which support these principles. However, I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.</p>  <p>  Production efficiency improvements are a core part of the efforts being undertaken by the agricultural sector.  I recently launched a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot scheme that builds on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme with a funding provision of &euro;20m in 2019. This new scheme is targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production.  </p>  <p>  Sequestration has also a key role to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the sector and &euro;106 million has been made available by my Department in 2018 under the Forestry Programme to support afforestation and other forest initiatives with significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options.</p>  <p>  The sector also plays a key role in the supply of biomass materials, adopting energy efficiency measures and renewable technologies on-farm as well as on-site energy generation all of which can provide profitability gains which underpins the sustainable production system as well as contributing to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  Higher ambition on environmental and climate action are part of the new CAP, post 2020, and it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget will contribute to climate and environmental action. This will require farmers to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures. </p>  <p>  As we look towards defining measures and targets under the new CAP regime, the recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of abatement measures we need to focus on to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector.  </p>  <p>  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p></reply>

This in turn sets the context for what is now a well-established process of strategy development at national level, with a new strategy developed every five years by all of the stakeholders in the sector. </p>  <p>  From a CAP perspective, clearly the objective is to create the conditions for the sector to develop to its full potential. The increasing market orientation of the policy over the last number of years - which Ireland fully supports - has allowed farmers to respond to the demands of the market rather than producing in line with EU supports. Demand for food at a global level is continuing to grow, and Ireland is responding through the production of high-quality, sustainably produced products that the market wants. Whether this arises in the case of meat or dairy or any other products, Ireland will continue to meet those demands in a sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  In terms of strategy development at national level, the latest iteration of this process is Food Wise 2025, which sets out a range of actions designed to ensure the sustainable development of the sector over the next number of years. Informed by the need to deploy human capital effectively, to ensure the competitiveness of the sector, to support market development and to encourage innovation, the strategy is also underpinned by the need to achieve sustainability in everything we do. Good progress is being made in the implementation of the strategy, and our thoughts are now turning to what its successor will aim to achieve in the period to 2030.</p>  <p>  The decision on what to produce is ultimately down to the primary producer, and is dictated by the need to respond to market demands. The primary focus of my Department and its agencies will be to continue to create the environment for such decisions to be made in an informed way, and in a way that ensures the sustainable development of the sector into the future. </p></reply>

This represents a 65% decrease in the number of herds restricted in 2000 highlighting the significant success of the TB Programme.  </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to compensation, the Irish TB Programme provides supports in excess of other jurisdictions. Farmers receive the open market value for any bovine diagnosed as a reactor (On Farm Market Valuation Scheme) and supplementary supports are also available to offset additional costs and income losses (Hardship Grant and Income Supplement).</p>  <p>  Research carried out on TB in deer in Ireland had found that in certain areas where there are high densities of deer, cattle and badgers living alongside each other, the same strains of TB can circulate between them. However, there is currently no evidence that deer play a significant role in the spread of TB to cattle in most parts of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The impacts of TB on a farmer are severe, causing financial hardship and emotional stress. This is why it is so important to reduce the numbers of farmers affected and to move to eradicate this disease. For that reason, I directed my officials to establish the TB Forum last year, so that all stakeholders can have a voice in discussing which policy options should be chosen to reduce disease levels and eradicate bovine TB from Ireland by 2030. The Forum discussions include the issues raised here, and have been discussed at length in a series of Forum meetings. Additionally, a series of bilateral meetings between my officials and the farming bodies have been held in the context of the TB Forum, which specifically included the issues of compensation, herds with high risk TB histories, and wildlife. </p></reply>

Perhaps the most substantial proposed change is in the form of a graduated reduction of payments over &euro;60,000 per annum.  A 100% reduction is to be applied to the amount of the payment exceeding &euro;100,000, at least 75% to payments between &euro;90,000 and &euro;100,000, at least 50% to payments between &euro;75,000 and &euro;90,000, and at least 25% to payments between &euro;60,000 and &euro;75,000.  </p>  <p>  The proposals state that Member States shall first subtract the salaries of the farmer including taxes and social contributions, before applying capping.  The cost of regular and unpaid labour should also be taken into account.  It is intended that the funding released from capping is to be used for the mandatory redistributive income support i.e. moving support from large to small/medium farms.  </p>  <p>  Under the new proposals, reductions will apply to all Pillar 1 payments.  This includes the complementary income support for young farmers, eco-schemes for the environment and coupled support.   </p>  <p>  Under the current rules, Member States must reduce direct payments to farmers in excess of &euro;150,000 by a minimum of 5%.  Ireland applied a 100% reduction to such payments.  This means that no farmer can receive more than &euro;150,000 under the Basic Payment Scheme.  However, capping applies to the Basic Payment only; payments for greening and the young farmer are additional to this.</p>  <p>  As regards the capping of direct payments post 2020, I have already said that Ireland is in principle open to the further capping of direct payments, and, similarly, to proposals to redistribute payments to smaller and medium sized farms within Member States.  However, I believe the proposal to deduct salaries and labour costs is unnecessarily complex and would be a significant administrative burden for Member States to implement.  </p></reply>

According to the CSO, 26 tonnes of beef were exported to Iran in 2017, but there have been no export of sheepmeat to-date.  Iran was not one of the top 5 priority markets identified by Bord Bia for meat, as part of the market prioritisation exercise carried out at the request of my Department. </p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities. However, the actual levels of exports will depend on a range of factors, including global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements. </p>  <p>  A veterinary health certificate for the export of beef from Ireland to Iran was agreed in March 2013. DAFM officials participated in a successful trade mission to Iran and Turkey in April 2016. While the trade mission was primarily dairy-focused, DAFM officials had the opportunity to meet with their Iranian counterparts in order to progress and ultimately agree sheepmeat access to the Iranian market and also to explore other common areas of interest.  Access for sheepmeat was officially announced in October 2016. Therefore these markets are open at present but the resumption of exports is a matter for the industry.   </p>  <p>  Limited or no exports of meat to Iran can be explained by a combination of unfavourable trading conditions, cheaper supplies of beef from Brazil and of lamb from Australia to the Iranian market, and financial barriers.  Work is on-going within the EU to devise measures to overcome financial barriers to trade between the EU and Iran.</p></reply>

This is why this Government continues to invest over &euro;100m each year in the National Forestry Programme. I also agree with the goal of increased broadleaf planting and mod-term review of this Programme introduced a number of policy changes last year which have already resulted in a 25% year on year increase in broadleaf planting.</p>  <p>  As regards Coillte, one of its statutory functions, under Section 12 of the Forestry Act 1988, is to &lsquo;carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices&rsquo;. A duty of the company, under Section 13, is also &lsquo;to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of its operations&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In relation to the consistency of Coillte&rsquo;s statutory functions with the principles of sustainable development and the EU&rsquo;s Long Term Climate Strategy for decarbonisation, I consider that the existing Forestry Act 1988 facilitates Coillte in the continued sustainable development of the public forest estate. </p>  <p>  Their operational matters are of course a matter for the company concerned and their policies evolve over time in response to emerging issues. Any issues concerning an operational or policy matter for Coillte can of course be directed to the Company for direct response.</p>  <p>  The independent certification of Coillte forests by both FSC and PEFC demonstrates sustainable forest management. I know that Coillte works diligently to maintain such certification.</p>  <p>  Coillte is also subject to the Forestry Act 2014, which was enacted to make further and better provision in relation to forestry, to provide for the development and promotion of forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management.</p>  <p>  Coillte, in carrying out its functions and duties, are providing a reliable supply of sustainably produced wood fibre to a thriving timber industry.  Coillte forests continuously sequester carbon as they grow and products made from harvested wood, such as the panel boards manufactured by Coillte&rsquo;s panel mills, safely lock-up carbon and provide an environmentally friendly substitute for carbon intense products such as plastic, concrete and steel.</p>  <p>  These are matters which I am assured are kept under constant review by the company.  I do not consider that sustainability issues are a matter for legislative change per se but rather one of ongoing operational review to ensure that it is fit for purpose. </p></reply>

My Department has been working with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service to engage Veterinary Inspectors, Portal Inspectors, Plant Health Inspectors and Administrative support staff.  Mechanisms to temporarily redeploy experienced people within my Department have also been initiated and the engagement of contracted temporary service arrangements is also being progressed. </p>  <p>  My Department will have more than 120 people trained and in place to support Brexit-related activities by the end of March, and further staffing resources will continue to be assigned during the months of April and May.

The threat faced by the Irish agri-food and fisheries sector is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  I have held a series of bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on this issue, including en marge of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels last week. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and the exceptional aid provisions under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  Commissioner Hogan has reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.  </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of any aid package will be announced in due course, in the event that a disorderly Brexit occurs. Obviously I very much hope that this outcome, with all its associated negative impacts for Ireland, the EU and the UK itself, will be avoided by the acceptance by the UK Parliament of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

For this reason, there are a range of advisory and information services available to help farmers understand the risks they face and make practical decisions on how best to mitigate those risks in the most appropriate way for their farm enterprise. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, farmers should discuss how to reduce the risk of disease with their private veterinary practitioner. Given how familiar the vet is with farms under his/her care, they are uniquely positioned to advise farmers on how to protect their cattle and their business.</p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to the excellent resources offered by Animal Health Ireland, who have a work programme specifically dedicated to biosecurity. The biosecurity technical working group of AHI has developed a series of leaflets on how farmers can understand, manage and reduce the risk of disease.  I would urge all new entrants to the dairy sector to engage with the Johnes Disease control programme, run by AHI and co-funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Regarding the risk posed by bovine TB, my Department provides advice to farmers through public meetings and online resources which are available on the bovine TB section of the Department&rsquo;s website on how to reduce the risk to their cattle. </p>  <p>  Contract rearing operations should pay particular attention to the risks of disease and Teagasc have provided a series of information sessions to farmers on this topic.

However, as Minister, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price; cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it. Cattle prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of consumer demand, production levels and exchange rate differences. Brexit also presents enormous challenges and ongoing uncertainty for the entire beef sector.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p>  <p>  While beef farmers obviously benefit from the full range of Pillar I direct payments and Rural Development Programme schemes, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector. This scheme provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. It is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  In addition, I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible.   Beef farmers will also be significant beneficiaries of the &euro;23m in additional funding provided to the ANC scheme this year. </p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations, which have the potential to help strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.</p></reply>

One of the lessons of the recent crisis is that Government didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to dissenting opinions and the National Risk Assessment provides an opportunity for an open and inclusive conversation on risks.</p>  <p>  This will be the sixth year the Government has produced the National Risk Assessment, and it has highlighted important issues since first published in 2014, including one of the earliest official acknowledgments of the risks arising from a potential Brexit. </p>  <p>  The development of the 2019 National Risk Assessment is at an early stage. In addition to cross-Departmental consultation, and public consultation, my Department plans to hold an Open Policy Seminar in Quarter 2, and all of these elements will inform the final Report, which as I mentioned, is generally published by July.</p></reply>

During the course of my speech I emphasised my Government's commitment to being fair and impartial in working with all parties in Northern Ireland and particularly with individuals, groups, and parties in civic nationalism and civic unionism.</p><p>I met with Alliance Party leader Naomi Long and other senior party members during the evening when we discussed a wide range of topics including the political situation and citizens rights in Northern Ireland and Brexit.</p><p>Prior to the Alliance Party dinner, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from Northern Ireland business organisations to hear their views and concerns on the latest Brexit developments  and the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland.  We discussed the importance of the All Island economy, challenges that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing and Brexit contingency planning being undertaken by the Irish Government.</p><p>I met with DUP Leader Arlene Foster while in the United States for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when we discussed the situation on Brexit as it stood at the time, including prospects for ratification by the UK of the Withdrawal Agreement. We also discussed political developments in Northern Ireland, including the importance of restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.  I also spoke with Ms Foster at events we were both attending.</p><p>Previously,  I  met  Arlene Foster and Sinn F&eacute;in Vice President Michelle O'Neill when I travelled to Belfast on Friday 8th February for a series of meetings with each of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland. I also met  UUP leader Robin Swann; Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long and Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP that day.</p><p>These meetings provided an opportunity to engage with the Northern Ireland political parties and to hear their views on latest Brexit developments and  on  the current political situation in Northern Ireland.  We discussed what could be done to get the institutions in Northern Ireland up and running again.  Once again, I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement,  and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  </p><p>The Government wants to see an agreement in place to secure the operation of the devolved institutions and we will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek to progress that in the period immediately ahead.</p><p>On Brexit, I outlined to each of the NI parties the Government's position, shared by the EU, that the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation and represents the best way to secure an orderly Brexit while avoiding a return to a hard border.</p></reply>

The Offices evaluate each fee note to decide what level of fee is appropriate for the work performed, taking into account a variety of factors including, inter alia, case complexity, amount of work done by counsel, and performance of counsel. Hence the final fee to be paid is not determined until the end of the process.</p><p>There are no fees owing to solicitors at the present time.</p></reply>

Personnel are expected to support the policy, by bringing instances of inappropriate behaviour to attention at an early stage and cooperating with any investigation whether as a complainant, the person complained of or as a witness.</p>  <p>  There are various ways to report a complaint under Administrative Instruction A7.</p>  <p>  Chapter 1 complaints deal with interpersonal relationships. These complaints follow an informal approach, where the complainant seeks advice from a third party or Designated Contact Person (DCP) to resolve the issue as early as possible. If the complaint cannot be resolved at this stage, then the complaint is formally lodged in writing to a superior. An investigation will follow.</p>  <p>  Chapter 2 complaints follow a more formal approach and deal with matters that fall under Section 114 of the Defence Act 1954. This procedure is used where a member of the Defence Forces thinks himself/herself wronged of any matter by another member of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the State, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded. The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration compensation paid &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; for the same disablement  </p><p>The award of a disability pension or of a disablement gratuity is considered under Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act 1923 (as amended) in situations where alternative compensation is received in respect of the same injury (or injuries).  Consideration under section 13(2) is confined to the specific injury for which the alternative compensation was also received.</p><p>In a case where Section 13(2) applies, the applicant or his/her solicitors are advised of the provisions of Section 13(2). They are invited to make submissions as to how much, if any of the alternative compensation should be taken into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  The Minister then makes a bona fide decision based on a consideration of all the facts of the case.  Each case is considered on the basis of its individual circumstances, which vary widely.  The Minister may decide to take all, some or none of the compensation into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  If the Minister decides to reduce the disability pension under Section 13(2), the reduction applies for the lifetime of the pension.</p><p>The Deputy has requested the number of cases in which personnel who were awarded damages in respect of injuries received while in the Defence Forces have had their pension entitlements restricted thereafter on the basis that they had received a civil award in courts.</p><p>The relevant legislative provisions have been in place since 1923.  </p><p>Information as specifically requested by the Deputy is not readily available and it is not possible to compile without incurring significant administrative overheads.  </p><p>However, information on the numbers over recent years who have had their disability benefits reduced or withheld under Section 13(2), including those where an award was received in court, is available and has been provided to the Deputy in November 2018 on foot of Parliamentary Question Number 70 on 17 October 2018.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.

In advance of the fourth and most recent session in October 2018, Ecuador circulated the zero draft of a legally binding instrument.   The next session of the Group will meet in October 2019 and Ireland will work with our EU partners to look at how we might actively and constructively engage in the negotiation process, notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date.  While we are open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty, we believe that all economic operators should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. The draft treaty that has currently been circulated focuses on transnational corporations and it is Ireland's view that any new treaty should cover both companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.</p>  <p>  We would wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point,  I would note that of the 21 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives..</p></reply>

This continues to be a matter of real concern for the Government. </p>  <p>  I wish, first of all, to extend my sincere sympathies and condolences to all of those affected by acts of violence in Colombia so far in 2019. I would like to reiterate that such violence is entirely unacceptable. I would also like to take this opportunity to once again urge the Government of Colombia to ensure that all such violent incidents are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to support peace and promote human rights in Colombia, including through the full implementation of the country&rsquo;s peace accord. In our exchanges with the government and official representatives of Colombia, we regularly raise human rights concerns, including the situation of human rights defenders and community leaders. As well as exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials at the Department and at our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across the country.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;14 million in funding to Colombia since 2007, focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. The Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia to support its important work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation. However, significant challenges still remain, including in the areas of de-mining, attention to victims, transitional justice, and rural development, some of which of course will have an impact on the situation of political and community activists. Ireland remains a committed partner to the Colombian Government in the peace process, and we will support the Government as it continues its work towards the full implementation of the peace accords, a message we have made clear in our contacts to date with the Government of President Iv&aacute;n Duque.</p>  <p>  In addition to the organisations mentioned above, my Department also provides funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Colombia, which works to support stabilisation in areas affected by the conflict, towards reincorporation of former combatants, and to support victims and systems of transitional justice, including by working to strengthen the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. </p>  <p>  Ireland was also a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and all projects incorporate a human rights and gender perspective.</p>  <p>  As we know from our own experience, peace is the work of decades.  Ireland is committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement to ensure the eradication of violence in vulnerable communities and a more peaceful and stable future for all Colombians. Having a permanent diplomatic presence on the ground, with the opening of our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; earlier this year, will greatly enhance our ability to meet that commitment, and we will continue to work alongside the Colombian Government and our EU, multilateral and civil society partners towards this goal. </p></reply>

In considering the expansion of our diplomatic representation overseas, a range of factors is taken into account including our national political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.

Sensitivities relating to development of indigenous lands without sufficient consultation or consent with the local population have been brought to my attention and I remain concerned at reports of unacceptable levels of violence and killings of land rights and indigenous rights activists, often those vocally opposing such projects. </p>  <p>  A report released in August 2018 by UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Ms. Victoria Tauli Corpuz, highlights the difficult situation that exists in several countries, including Brazil, for indigenous communities and activists. The report concludes that states carry the primary responsibility for ensuring that indigenous peoples are able to safely exercise their rights and that accountability is established for violations against indigenous communities and defenders. The reports also highlights the necessity to engage in genuine, free and informed consultation with communities prior to development. </p>  <p>  Ireland has called on a number of occasions for states, including Brazil, to ensure full accountability for any violence, harassment or intimidation of civil society, indigenous or environmental activists exercising their rights to freedom of expression, and for the respect of indigenous communities' rights. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that call.</p>  <p>  Ireland used the occasion of the 27th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 5 May 2017 to express our concern at the reported regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in Brazil.  Ireland recommended that Brazil take further steps to protect human rights defenders, including those working in relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, by ensuring impartial, thorough and effective investigations into all cases of attacks, harassment and intimidation and the prosecution of all alleged perpetrators of such offences.</p>  <p>  In addition to these representations at multilateral level, officials of my Department at home and at our Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia engage regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Latin America, including those working on the rights of indigenous communities. </p>  <p>  I take note of President Bolsonaro's decision to keep Brazil in the Paris Agreement, which is an encouraging development. Ireland is a committed supporter of global efforts to combat climate change, one of the most serious threats facing the world today, and Brazil has been an important partner on this issue. Brazil played a key role in the formation of the Paris Agreement of 2015, and this is an indication that President Bolsonaro will honour these commitments. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with Brazil, and other partners in the Latin America and Caribbean region, on the issues of climate change, sustainable development, and indigenous rights through our bilateral, EU level and EU-CELAC relationships.  We will monitor developments closely, and will continue to engage with EU and local partners, raising these issues at EU and UN level as appropriate.</p></reply>

The European Union recognises that conditions in Libyan detention centres are a matter of great concern and this informs the approach taken in designing programmes funded through the EU Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF). </p>  <p>  The EU is providing support to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist migrants inside Libyan detention centres, including with primary medical assistance. The focus of EUTF-funded actions in detention centres run by the Libyan Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) is two-fold: improving conditions for detainees and assisting detainees with voluntary humanitarian repatriation to their countries of origin. The EUTF is supporting the provision of emergency medical and life-saving services to detained migrants, including psycho-social support. Support is provided for improving sanitary and hygiene conditions, such as by the provision of toilets, showers, storage/distribution capacity for drinking water and sewerage systems, and for the distribution of essential non-food items to detainees. Importantly, the EUTF also supports the provision of human rights and protection training for detention centre personnel.</p>  <p>  Country-level programming for a total of &euro;282 million has been approved to date for Libya. The EU is actively working to provide protection, assistance and alternatives to migrants, refugees, internally displaced people and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings. All projects are implemented by international partners on the ground, such as UN agencies or EU Member States. For example, almost 90,000 refugees and vulnerable migrants have received medical assistance through EUTF programming. Health care centres, clinics, schools and electrical substations have been rehabilitated or equipped. Because the system of arbitrary detention in Libya must be brought to an end, the EU does not provide food assistance in a systematic manner inside detention centres. The EU is firmly opposed to the institutionalisation of the detention system.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to detention centres need to be established, in particular for vulnerable migrants, and Ireland has called on the Libyan authorities to continue to work with the relevant international organisations to make this possible. In the shorter term, oversight in detention centres needs to be vastly expanded and improved. All parties, including those with de facto control of territory, have a responsibility to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate UN and other humanitarian access to detention centres. However, continued efforts are required to bring an end to the unacceptable conditions migrants and refugees face in Libya.</p>  <p>  During the last year, some progress has been made in alleviating the plight of migrants in Libya. In late 2017, the EU stepped up its cooperation with UN agencies and the African Union to accelerate returns from Libya for those migrants who wish to leave, and to establish safe and legal pathways to resettle those who need international protection. This has contributed to the voluntary return of more than 37,000 vulnerable migrants. In early March, the UNHCR carried out its third evacuation of refugees out of Libya this year, bringing the total of those evacuated to over 3,300. </p>  <p>  Support to the Libyan Coast Guard through the EUTF is included in the &euro;91.3 million programme of Support to Integrated Border and Migration Management, the first phase of which was adopted in July 2017 and the second in December 2018. This programme provides training, including on human rights, and equipment, notably communication and rescue equipment, as well as developing institutional capacity. The programme also aims to ensure that the Libyan authorities comply with human rights standards in Search and Rescue operations. Ireland shares the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR&rsquo;s assessment that Libya is not a safe third country. It is for this reason that it is not EU policy to send people back to Libya, but rather to disrupt the business model of migrant smugglers or traffickers, so as to prevent further loss of life in the Mediterranean. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to end these abuses. There is a governance vacuum in many areas of the country, and access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted in many areas, including in detention centres. Bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning and unified government. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions.</p>  <p>  While Libya is the epicentre of this crisis, a long-term solution will require further cooperation from states all along migration routes, and the support of regional partners and the international community. Work to reduce poverty in countries of origin, which is one of the main drivers of irregular migratory flows, is at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.</p></reply>

Revenue has appointed over 400 staff from open recruitment and interdepartmental competitions since the start of 2019.   And these staff will have completed their necessary training by 15 April 2019 in preparation for Brexit. </p>  <p>  These posts have been filled from open, interdepartmental and internal Revenue competitions, as well as redeployment of staff within Revenue.   An open recruitment campaign for trade facilitation roles was undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) in October 2018, this attracted more than 3,000 applications.  This competition was advertised on the PAS website (publicjobs.ie) and on the Revenue website to ensure that recruitment is from the widest pool of available talent and experience.   Revenue also held 6 internal competitions for existing Revenue staff at Higher Executive Officer, Executive Officer and Clerical Officer level for assignment to trade facilitation roles.  Candidates were selected using methodologies such as on-line testing and competitive interviews to facilitate the identification of the best candidates. Recruitment for appointment to positions in Revenue is subject to the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and subject to the CPSA Codes of Practice.     </p>  <p>  As serving staff are taking up their new Brexit related positions, Revenue is backfilling the vacancies created through panels of candidates established from its general recruitment activity.</p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Revenue plans to appoint a further 200 staff during the rest of 2019. This would bring the total additional staff recruited to the 600 staff required to deal with the UK withdrawal from the EU.</p></reply>

A high-level overview of some of the substantive provisions across the various tax heads is set out below. However, if the Deputy has a particular case or a particular need in mind Revenue is willing to engage on that particular case or issue.</p><p>Reduced rates of VAT and refund orders are provided for in the VAT Consolidation Act 2010. For example, the supply of a range of medical equipment and appliances, which include invalid carriages (excluding mechanically propelled road vehicles), orthopedic appliances, deaf aids, walking frames and crutches are subject to a zero rate of VAT.  </p><p>The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981, provides, in certain circumstances for the refund of VAT on goods which are aids or appliances and includes goods specially constructed or adapted for use that are purchased for the exclusive use of a person with a disability of a type specified for the purposes of the Order. The provisions of the Order also extend to works carried out on homes to adapt them to make them more accessible for disabled persons.</p><p>The disabled drivers and passengers scheme provides relief, subject to qualifying criteria, from Vehicle Registration Tax, VAT and road tax, for persons with disabilities.</p><p>Within the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 (CATCA), the following measures are provided:</p><p>- Sections 17 and 22 provide for an exemption from discretionary trust tax in the case of discretionary trusts established for the benefit of incapacitated persons who, because of age or improvidence, or of physical, mental or legal incapacity are incapable of managing their own affairs;</p><p>- Section 82 provides that receipts by a permanently incapacitated individual of funds which are held on a qualifying trust or of incomes deriving from funds held on such trusts is not subject to capital acquisitions tax;</p><p>- Section 84 provides for an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on gifts or inheritances taken exclusively for discharging the qualifying expenses of an individual who is permanently incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity; and</p><p>- Section 86 provides for an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on the transfer of a dwelling house to dependent relative provided they have lived in the dwelling house for the three years preceding the gift or inheritance and they do not have an interest in another dwelling house. </p><p>The following measures relating to local property tax and residential properties are contained in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended): </p><p>- Section 5 provides an exemption for properties that have been vacated by the owner because of long-term physical or mental infirmity;</p><p>- Section 7 provides an exemption for properties owned by charities or public bodies that are used to provide accommodation to people who, because of old age, physical or mental disability, require a  particular type of accommodation and support to enable them to live in thecommunity;</p><p>- Section 10B provides an exemption for properties acquired or adapted to make them suitable for occupation by certain permanently and totally incapacitated people; and </p><p>- Section 15A provides for a reduction in the taxable value of properties that are adapted to make them more suitable for the accommodation of certain persons with a disability where the taxable value is increased as a result of the adaptation work carried out on the property.</p><p>Within the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA), the following measures are provided:</p><p>- Section 126 provides an exemption from income tax for the following social welfare payments:</p><p>- Carers Support grant</p><p>- Constant attendance allowance</p><p>- Disability allowance</p><p>- Domiciliary Care allowance</p><p>- Section 189 provides an exemption from tax in personal injury cases and applies to payments made &ldquo;to or in respect of an individual who is permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself&rdquo;; </p><p>- Section 189A provides for income tax and capital gains tax exemptions in the case of special trusts established for the benefit of incapacitated individuals;  </p><p>- Section 189B provides an exemption from income tax for periodic payments made for personal injuries;</p><p>- Section 190 provides an exemption from tax for compensation payments made to individuals by the Haemophilia H.I.V.

However, parents cannot covenant to a permanently incapacitated minor child (i.e. under 18 years of age); </p><p>- Guide Dogs Allowance - can be claimed as part of health expenses where an individual or his/her spouse has a guide dog and is a registered owner with 'Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind';</p><p>- Assistance/Service Dogs Allowance - can be claimed as part of health expenses where an individual or his/her spouse or child has an assistance or service dog that has been supplied by an organisation accredited by Assistance Dogs Europe.</p><p>In relation to question 12821, under the Commissioners Order 1923 (S.I. No.2 of 1923), Revenue has statutory responsibility for the performance of its functions and is independent in dealing with the tax affairs of any individual under tax and customs legislation. Section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 gives legal effect to Revenue&rsquo;s independence in the performance of its functions. As set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 173, Revenue&rsquo;s treatment of any individual is subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Ombudsman. Revenue&rsquo;s Chairman is the Accounting Officer and Head of Office under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, (PSMA) and in accordance with PSMA, Revenue reports annually on its Statement of Strategy to me as Minister for Finance. Revenue submits end of year accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months of the end of every financial year. As Accounting Officer, and in accordance with section 10 PSMA, the Chairman appears before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with issues arising from Reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and other matters relating to Revenue activities that the Committee may wish to discuss.  </p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s Chairman and Revenue officials regularly appear as witnesses before other Oireachtas Committees such as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Taoiseach, and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, on matters relating to Revenue activities. Furthermore, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act, 2013, in respect of the exercise by either or both Houses of the Oireachtas (or by a Committee of either House or both Houses) of a power to conduct an inquiry into specified matters, including the provisions for matters relating to compellability, apply to Revenue. </p><p>In relation to the overall administration of the taxation and customs systems, Revenue is accountable to me as Minister for Finance. As regards parliamentary oversight, I present Revenue-related legislation to the Oireachtas; lay Revenue&rsquo;s Annual Report and accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas; present estimates for Revenue expenditure in the D&aacute;il and present Revenue&rsquo;s views, positions and observations on proposals to Cabinet. Tax policy is the responsibility of my Department and my officials work closely with Revenue officials on related issues. I have already said in reply to the earlier Parliamentary Question referred to above that I do not see a need for further identification of vulnerable persons in the tax code. However, as I also said in my reply to the earlier question, I am advised by Revenue that if the Deputy has identified a specific group of vulnerable taxpayers whose needs are not met by existing services, Revenue&rsquo;s customer services team would be happy to engage with him to identify scope for further improvement. </p></reply>

Tax evasion is a predicate offence for money laundering. In cases where the STR relates to other criminal activity it becomes a matter for An Garda S?och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of STRs received from designated bodies, including financial institutions, under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Funding) Act, 2010 for 2009 to 2018 is as set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>STRs Received</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>14,117 </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>13,395 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>11,070 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>12,175 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>14,688 </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>18,149 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>21,358 </td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>22,607 </td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>24,232 </td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>23,422 </td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that as regards the institutions that submit STRs, they do not have information identifying the county or regional location of such institutions  and therefore cannot provide the breakdown of STRs sought by the Deputy.</p><p>I understand that Revenue continues to engage actively with designated bodies at conferences and industry fora to communicate best practice for Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLRO) regarding the submission of quality STRs, and to emphasise the importance of STR reports to Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing compliance programmes. Such speaking events are often undertaken in conjunction with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau&rsquo;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which handles STRs on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>On receipt by Revenue, all STRs are linked to the relevant taxpayer&rsquo;s record, assigned a risk rating, and the data is incorporated into each taxpayer&rsquo;s risk profile, informing Revenue&rsquo;s decision as to the nature of any compliance intervention that may be appropriate having regards to the overall risk. In 2017, the yield from audit cases involving STRs was &euro;5.5 million. The figures for 2018 will be available in May of this year. </p><p>I am advised that it is not possible to quantify the number of cases that lead to a prosecution, as the information received in an STR forms, as previously indicated, form only part of the overall risk profile for an individual taxpayer, and may, or may not, contribute to a decision to refer a taxpayer for prosecution. </p><p>Finally, I do not consider that there is a link that can be usefully made between the level of STRs reported to Revenue and the need for vigilance by members of the public to protect themselves against the effort of fraudsters to get access to their money. However, I am aware that Revenue regularly highlights the importance of taxpayers taking appropriate steps to safeguard their personal financial or banking details and has emphasised that Revenue will never seek to acquire those details through telephone contacts with taxpayers.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Review shows that employment and profitability in hairdressing increased over 2011 to 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, the main finding of the Department&rsquo;s Review is that expenditure on 9% goods and services is particularly sensitive to income growth and to the economic cycle, more so than to price changes. An increase in the VAT rate applied to hairdressing therefore should not greatly impact demand in the sector. This is evidenced by studies which have shown that hairdressing services are twice the cost in Ireland compared to Northern Ireland, despite the fact that a 20% VAT rate applies to the service in the North compared to 13.5% here.</p></reply>

Hypothecation describes the linkage of specific expenditure to an explicit revenue source. As the Deputy will be aware, this is not a feature of the Irish tax system in general. It is only used in limited circumstances where there is strong justification for its use, because it can cause difficulties for the efficient and effective management of the public finances. I and my officials are generally opposed to the hypothecation of revenue funds as it reduces the flexibility of the Government to prioritise and allocate funds as necessary at a particular time.  Furthermore, it also exposes specific expenditure dependent solely on a hypothecated revenue to any volatility associated with the revenue source in question.</p></reply>

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector. However it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated, resulting in a situation in which elements in the industry and certain agents aggressively pursued zero rating of all kinds of products, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover, build muscle and reduce stress. These businesses consistently challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  The industry&rsquo;s representative body, the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), raised concerns with Revenue about the difficulties in distinguishing between food supplement products which could be zero rated and those which should be standard rated. In response to the issues raised by the IHTA, Revenue undertook a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements and engaged an expert to advise on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010. Based on the expert advice and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. I decided not to introduce any legislative changes at that time but as the Deputy may be aware I have committed to putting in place a consultation process to help me identify the policy options in relation to VAT on food supplements and will publish the conclusions in the Tax Strategy Papers later this year. I envisage seeking input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, to ensure that any legislative changes I bring forward are evidence based, and I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Health in this regard.</p>  <p>  Details on the public consultation will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

However, under the EU VAT Directive, there is no scope to allow VAT deductibility in relation to the development of properties that are to be put to a tax-exempt use. The VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides that the letting of residential property is exempt from VAT.  Thus, where a developer incurs VAT on the construction costs of a residential property and lets the property upon completion, the developer is not entitled to recover the VAT on those costs as the letting of the property is exempt from VAT. </p>  <p>  Section 97 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) sets out the deductions allowable in computing rental income chargeable to income tax or corporation tax under Case V of Schedule D. Income chargeable under Case V is computed on the gross amount of rent receivable less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2).  These are:</p>  <p>  - rent payable on the property by the person chargeable,</p>  <p>  - rates payable on the property by the person chargeable (either in accordance with the terms of a lease or as an expense of the agreement under which the rent/receipts were received),</p>  <p>  - the cost of goods provided and services rendered by the person chargeable in relation to the letting of the property (where such person is either legally bound under the lease to provide such goods and services or the provision of such goods and services constitute an expense of the agreement under which the rent/receipts were received),</p>  <p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the premises borne by the person chargeable and which constitute an expense of the agreement under which the rent/receipts were received, but excluding any capital expenditure,</p>  <p>  - interest on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair the premises.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, any VAT incurred on the purchase of a premises is not deductible under section 97(2) TCA against rental income from the premises, for either income tax or corporation tax purposes.  </p>  <p>  I would add that where a person, not being a property developer, has incurred VAT on the conversion of a property that is to be let as residential accommodation in a special regeneration area under the Living City Initiative scheme (Chapter 13 of Part 10 TCA refers), capital allowances will be available on the VAT inclusive eligible expenditure, provided the terms and conditions of that scheme have been met.</p></reply>

I have always been clear that HBFI was to be established on a commercial basis and that its activities would comply with State aid rules. Any funding provided by HBFI will be backed by appropriate security and normal banking terms and conditions will apply. Any deviation from this structure could give rise to State aid issues and may impact the expected balance sheet treatment of HBFI's activities.</p>  <p>  While there is nothing contained in the Home Building Finance Ireland Act 2018 that excludes loans to owner management companies to cover remedial building costs, the Act requires that HBFI lend on commercial terms. The commerciality of funding such remediation is risky from two perspectives:</p>  <p>  1. The projected costs of such projects can often exceed the estimates once the &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; works are undertaken due to the discovery of other issues which were not evident or identified during the investigation work.</p>  <p>  2. Management Companies do not generally have the ability to provide security for the sums being borrowed. </p>  <p>  Based on the high level of risk that would pertain to such lending, it may not be considered commercial in many cases and could put HBFI in breach of its commercial remit. </p>  <p>  HBFI will examine each application received on its own merits and particular circumstances. It is a matter for HBFI to assess and, if thought appropriate, issue a term sheet having regard to State aid rules and its commercial responsibilities.</p>  <p>  I am advised by HBFI that only a very small number of calls and emails have been received in relation to this type of funding to date and that none of these enquiries have progressed to a full application at this time.</p></reply>

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The eighth such update was published at the start of March 2019 and shows that 29 of the 33 recommendations have either been completed, are categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; and in respect of which work is continuing, or have been concluded in so far as the direct involvement of the Working Group is concerned.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, it has to be acknowledged that the CSO CPI statistics indicate that pricing in the private motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year or two and I welcome the direction of travel which this index has displayed since it peaked in July 2016.  However, it is accepted that premiums may still be at a high level for many people.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I understand from my officials that it is difficult to obtain reliable data to accurately compare the cost of motor insurance here to that in other EU countries.  In any event, such international comparisons on the basis of price alone would not take into account factors such as the various regulatory environments and liability systems in place in different jurisdictions.  For example, in certain EU countries, it is mandatory only for the vehicle to be insured meaning direct comparisons are not useful or instructive.</p></reply>

Thus, for example, in the case of a person in receipt of a State pension and a private pension, an increase of &euro;5 per week in the State pension could mean that tax on an additional &euro;260 would have to be collected over the course of the year by reducing the person&rsquo;s tax credits in relation to the private pension.  &euro;260 extra income at the standard rate of income tax of 20% gives rise to a reduction in tax credits of &euro;52 for the year or &euro;4.34 per month. For standard rate taxpayers this means the individual, or couple, would retain almost 80% of the weekly increase. In the case of higher rate taxpayers, the amount retained would represent almost 60% of the weekly increase. </p>  <p>  However, in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to what assistance is provided generally to State pensioners in the income tax system, I would draw his attention to section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in particular. That section provides that a person aged 65 and over is fully exempt from income tax where his or her total income from all sources is less than the relevant exemption limit.  For 2019, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual.  An individual or couple whose income is below the respective limit can also apply directly to their financial institution to have interest due on deposits accounts paid without any deduction of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT).  </p>  <p>  For those taxpayers, who do not qualify for exemption under section 188 of the TCA 1997, section 464 TCA 1997 provides for an &ldquo;Age Tax Credit&rdquo; for all individuals aged 65 or over. This credit is currently set at &euro;245 for single individuals or &euro;490 for married people.</p>  <p>  In the broader context of limited Government resources, it is my position that an appropriate amount of funds are currently allocated, to ensure a fair and consistent tax treatment for those over the age of 65 through these exemptions and credits.</p></reply>

This Decision lays down the three main sources of EU revenue, or &lsquo;Own Resources&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  - Customs duties in respect of trade with non-member countries and levies on sugar production within the Union. These are collectively known as &ldquo;Traditional Own Resources&rdquo; (TOR). </p>  <p>  - VAT: the VAT own resource is calculated on the basis of a notional harmonised rate. </p>  <p>  - Gross National Income (GNI)-based contributions: the amount due is calculated by taking the same proportion of each Member State&rsquo;s GNI.  The GNI-based resource is the Budget-balancing item; it covers the difference between total expenditure in the Budget and the revenue from the other resources, subject to the overall Own Resources ceiling. </p>  <p>  The GNI component of the EU budget accounted for 56.3 per cent of the budget's total revenue in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is obliged to make GNI payments to the EU budget based on Ireland's share of overall EU GNI.  To accurately estimate the application of GNI star for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Budget contributions would require making the same technical adjustments to the GNIs of each of the remaining EU-27 Member States.  Such data is not available for all other Member States.  </p>  <p>  Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible to assess the impact of moving EU budget contributions from GNI to GNI star in the absence of such data. </p>  <p>  It is worth recalling that GNI star, or Modified GNI, was developed by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as a supplementary method for measuring and analysing Irish domestic economic activity by stripping out the impact of globalisation activities.  It is important to stress that, from a legal perspective, the CSO is compelled to produce existing macroeconomic statistics (GDP, GNI, etc.) in accordance with internationally-agreed methodologies. </p></reply>

An IREF is an investment fund that derives 25% or more of its value from Irish real estate. As an investment undertaking, the profits or gains of the IREF are not taxed within the fund, but instead are subject to tax in the hands of the investors. As a result information on net rental profits or capital gains from property within IREFs is not available as distributions of value (generally comprised of accrued income and/or gains) are the reference point for taxation.</p>  <p>  Where an investor receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply. There are a number of classes of investor that are exempt from the operation of this withholding tax, such as pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  Investors who own less than 10% of the IREF can make a claim for a repayment of dividend withholding tax if they are entitled to a lower rate of withholding tax under a double tax agreement. </p>  <p>  IREFs are required to declare and pay this withholding tax on an annual basis and I am advised by Revenue that the first return and payment of IREF withholding tax was due 30 July 2018 where a fund had an accounting period that ended in the second half of 2017. The amount of IREF withholding tax collected on the distribution of profits by relevant IREFs was in the region of &euro;9m for this period. The data collected by Revenue relates to the distributions paid out of the funds. It is important to note that any profits which remain within the fund will be subject to tax when they are eventually distributed to investors. Returns were due to Revenue in January in respect of funds with accounting periods ending in the six months to July of 2018, these returns are currently being processed and information will be available in due course.  </p>  <p>  The rules relating to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland are found in Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and were introduced by Finance Act 2013. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits and gains to their shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other business (i.e. non-property business) that it carries on.  </p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  Investors can make a claim for a repayment of dividend withholding tax if they are entitled to a lower rate of withholding tax under a double tax agreement. I am advised by Revenue that net  dividend withholding tax amounting to &euro;11.8 million in 2017 and &euro;12.4 million in 2018 was collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs.  </p>  <p>  As REITs are not subject to Corporation Tax on their Irish property profits or gains, there is no obligation to report these amounts to Revenue. Revenue has also confirmed that, due to the small number of REITs involved and its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information, it cannot provide specific information in relation to the income or capital gains associated with these entities. </p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p>  <p>  Property rental income and gains arising are exempt from tax within the REIT and are taxed at the investor level when distributed. The legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders. The REIT is subject to corporation tax on income and gains not arising from the property rental business of the REIT.  </p>  <p>  Introduced in Finance Act 2016, Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where at least 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  </p>  <p>  The IREF provisions addressed the concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property.  The investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.    </p>  <p>  IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors.  REITs must also deduct withholding tax on distributions to shareholders.  In both cases the withholding tax does not apply to certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings as these funds also operate on a gross-roll-up basis with tax payable by the pensioner/investor (as relevant) on receipt of income or distributions.  </p>  <p>  Information in relation to the proportion of property in REITs and IREFs held by EEA pension funds is not readily available.  However the Deputy will recall a commitment I made during committee and report stages of the 2018 Finance Bill process regarding the preparation by my officials of a policy paper relation to the impact of the REITs, IREF and section 110 regimes on the property market.  This will include research into the investors in such funds and the resulting report will be presented before the Tax Strategy Group this summer.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. </p></reply>

The current best financial institution interest rate at the end of each year for which the loan is outstanding is used to determine the best price obtainable in the open market. </p><p>However, if the annual value of the free use of a loan is less than &euro;3,000 (known as the &lsquo;small gift&rsquo; exemption), the gift each year is exempt from gift tax provided the child has received no other gifts in the same year from the same parent.  If this annual value exceeds &euro;3,000 then only the excess amount each year is treated as a taxable gift. However, gift tax only becomes payable when the total value of all taxable gifts and inheritances taken by the child from his or her parents exceeds the Group A tax-free threshold which is currently &euro;320,000. A tax rate of 33% applies above this threshold. </p><p>As there is no fixed statutory rate of interest for gift tax purposes, but a rate that varies automatically with current market rates, the matter of consultation with the Department of Finance about the annual rate used does not arise. There is no basis, therefore for proposing the application of a statutory rate of interest. </p><p>I am also informed by Revenue that the amount of benefit-in-kind to be charged to income tax (under section 122 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) where loans at preferential rates of interest are made by employers to their employees is determined by a fixed statutory rate of interest that is adjusted from time to time by way of the Finance Act.  While, the standard such rate is currently 13&frac12;%, a lower rate of 4% applies in the case of home mortgage loans. An employee in receipt of a preferential loan is charged to income tax on the difference between the amount of interest that would have been payable on the preferential loan if interest had been paid at the fixed statutory rate and the amount of interest, if any, actually paid on the loan.</p><p>Where the employer and employee are related and the preferential loan is made in a personal capacity from personal resources, the benefit-in-kind provisions are not applied. However, depending on the value of the loan made, the prevailing market interest rate and the applicable tax-free group threshold, gift tax may be payable.</p><p>The tax code currently allows for the making of interest-free loans between parents and their children subject to a potential liability to gift tax. As with most taxes, gift tax operates on a self-assessment basis subject to Revenue compliance checks and audit. Where Revenue identifies arrangements that are not in accordance with the relevant legislation it takes appropriate corrective action. </p><p>In relation to Question 13551/19, I am informed by Revenue that an estimate of the value of assets transferred as inheritances from Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) returns is shown in table 2 in the following at link<b></b><i>.</i>Revenue has also advised me that the published figure for 2017 is now updated to &euro;3.6 billion and a tentative estimate for 2018 is &euro;4.4 billion.</p><p>The Central Bank publishes data on household wealth at an aggregate rather than an individual level in the Quarterly Financial Accounts the most recent being for Q3 2018 <i></i></p><p>No comparison between the Central Bank data and CAT returns is available.  </p><p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) conducted the first Household Finance &amp;amp; Consumption Survey (HFCS) in 2013. While a comparison of the value of assets as indicated in the survey against CAT returns is not available, the Revenue report at the above link (page 8) includes a comparison of the number of CAT returns to the number of (indicated) inheritances and gifts.</p><p>Overall, the analysis of the HFCS suggests that there are more gift or inheritance transactions occurring than reported in returns filed with Revenue. However, the difference is likely to be explained by the majority of these transactions not being liable to CAT due to the various reliefs and exemptions that are available in respect of the tax.</p></reply>

In responding to the Deputy's question I propose to take each of these four issues in turn.</p>  <p>  National Claims Information Database (NCID): I can confirm that the NCID will be fully operational soon and later this year it is expected that the first report will be made.  While it is important that the database initially focuses on private motor insurance, the relevant underpinning legislation &ndash; the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 &ndash; allows for the scope of the database to be expanded to other types of insurance.  In this regard, a recommendation was made in the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance for the Central Bank to conduct an analysis on the feasibility and merit of extending the NCID to employer and public liability insurance.  It is considered that the second half of 2019 is the most appropriate time to expect the Central Bank to have completed this task.</p>  <p>  Notification of policyholders of claims made against them:  the CIWG agrees that insurance companies ought to notify policyholders of claims made before settlement, the amount a claim was settled for, and the reasons why the claim was settled. Accordingly, this exact issue forms the basis of Recommendation 10 in the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  In addition, a similar recommendation in respect of motor insurance policyholders has been included in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  Having been unable to reach agreement with Insurance Ireland on a new set of guidelines based on those drawn up by IBEC and the Irish Insurance Federation in 2004, my Department is currently considering the merits of addressing this issue through primary legislation, specifically by an amendment to a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on Consumer Insurance Contracts.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Book of Quantum, the Fianna F&aacute;il motion of 13 March called for the immediate commencement of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 in order to require PIAB to update the Book of Quantum at least every three years.  I understand from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation that it is intended the Act will take effect from 3 April 2019.  However, it should be borne in mind that the Book merely reflects the prevailing levels of compensation for various types of injury based upon what has actually been paid out in the Courts, by the State Claims Agency,  or awarded by PIAB.  Currently, therefore, the only way that the award levels in the Book can be lowered is if there is first a decrease in the actual level of awards paid out. In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) has proposed that this reduction be achieved by the Judicial Council compiling a recalibrated set of guidelines for various types of personal injury, which would in effect replace the Book of Quantum.  Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy has made it clear that bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is his primary objective, and has been exploring a number of options in attempting to reach this target.  In this regard, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has engaged with his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, and he has been informed that the Judicial Council Bill is to be prioritised with a view to having this legislation in place as soon as possible to allow for the establishment of the Judicial Council. </p>  <p>  Garda Insurance Fraud Unit: the CIWG&rsquo;s latest Progress Update confirms that the Garda Commissioner has undertaken to further consider the establishment of an insurance fraud investigation unit within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB).  In response to the original proposal to explore the possibility that a specific unit be set up within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using funding from the insurance industry, the Commissioner indicated his preference that, in principle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be funded by any source other than the Exchequer for the purposes of tackling insurance fraud.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and neither I, nor Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, nor the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role in such operational matters.  Nevertheless, Minister D&rsquo;Arcy remains committed to pursuing this matter, and is hopeful that there will be improved investigative capacity in place in this area shortly.</p></reply>

I am assuming that the Deputy, when referring to solid fuel smuggling, is enquiring about the movement of solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland in the context of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT). SFCT is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to solid fuel movements into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Where a supplier makes a supply in the State of a quantity of solid fuel, the supply is subject to SFCT and the supplier is accountable for and must pay the tax to Revenue. Where an individual purchases solid fuel from a supplier in another Member State and brings it into the State a SFCT liability does not arise, provided the fuel is for their own private use and they accompany it into the State. If, however, such an individual supplies another person in the State with the fuel, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to account for and pay SFCT.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border controls in relation to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States. Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel entering the State from Northern Ireland. Similarly, the transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession. </p>  <p>  SFCT is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis.  Fuel suppliers must, on a bi-monthly basis, file a return for all first supplies of coal and peat made in the State during the period. They have one month following the end of each SFCT accounting period to file their return and pay the tax due. SFCT law is enforced by Revenue using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.  I am advised that to date, Revenue has undertaken actions to enforce approximately &euro;640,000 of solid fuel carbon tax. </p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection by Revenue of SFCT is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are engaged in ongoing discussions on the scope for joint operations to support each organisation&rsquo;s respective roles in ensuring compliance with SFCT law and environmental regulations relating to the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. </p></reply>

I have been advised by the Central Bank that they are aware of the reported practice that some lenders apply legal costs to the mortgage accounts of borrowers in arrears before the conclusion of legal proceedings. The Central Bank is examining this practice to determine if it is permissible under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and other regulations.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing provisions that are in place in the area of the imposition of charges or interest; provision 11 of the CCMA states that lenders are restricted from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears, unless the borrower is not co-operating.</p>  <p>  Separately, under Provision 29(2) of the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, any charge that a creditor may impose on a consumer arising from the consumer&rsquo;s default &ldquo;shall be no greater than is necessary to compensate the creditor for the costs it has incurred as a result of the default.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  There are also requirements in the CCMA relating to the information which must be provided to borrowers about legal costs. These are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Under Provision 14 of the CCMA, a lender must prepare and make available to borrowers an information booklet with details of its Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which must include with regard to legal proceedings, a statement that, irrespective of how the property is repossessed or disposed of, the borrower will remain liable for the outstanding debt, including any accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs, if this is the case. </p>  <p>  - The borrower must also be reminded of the above information when three repayments have been missed (Provision 27), prior to being classified as not co-operating (Provision 28), where a lender is not willing to offer an alternative repayment arrangement due to concluding that the mortgage is unsustainable (Provision 45), and/or where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement (Provision 47). </p>  <p>  - Provision 27 of the CCMA also requires that where three mortgage repayments have been missed and remain outstanding, and an alternative repayment arrangement has not been put in place, the lender must notify the borrower of the potential for legal proceedings for repossession of the property where a borrower is not co-operating, together with an estimate of the costs to the borrower of such proceedings.</p>  <p>  Also of relevance is that under Provision 14(1)(h) of the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, the lender must make available to the borrower, on paper or another durable medium, &ldquo;an indication of possible further costs, not included in the total cost of the credit to the consumer, to be paid in connection with a credit agreement.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The reduction would not exceed the amount of additional expenditure actually incurred. The Bill deliberately does not describe such an event in greater detail than &ldquo;a natural or other disaster&rdquo;. This is because it is intended to refer to the type of events which are unpredictable and create an immediate cost. </p>  <p>  I envision this contingency being activated if, for example, there is an exceptionally severe weather event causing enormous damage, or a major health or disease risk such as a significant outbreak of a contagious disease. This facility is not intended to substitute for prudent contingency budgeting by public authorities &ndash; it is only for events that are inherently exceptional, or exceptionally repeated in a given year. That might arise if there are repeated storms, for example. If this facility is used, any payment made will be directly from the Exchequer under the normal public financial procedures. In addition, the Minister for Finance will make a report to this House, in accordance with Section 5, subsection 7, as to the reasons for reducing the payment being made into the Fund.</p>  <p>  Under the Bill the proposed &ldquo;Rainy Day Fund&rdquo; can be drawn on contingent on Government and Oireachtas approval being received for one of the criteria set out under section 9(2) of the Bill. Brexit is not in itself an exceptional contingency as it has been confirmed since 2016 and it has been at the core of policy making during that time. There are obvious external risks to the Irish economy including Brexit but these are known risks for which we are undertaking extensive preparedness planning, including for a no deal scenario. The Government has worked hard at national and European level to build support for Irish positions and the Government's budgetary policies have worked to ensure fiscal resilience and a balanced tax base. We are now in a far better position to weather the storm when a future crisis hits. Setting reserves aside now through the Rainy Day Fund will further strengthen our position.</p></reply>

The Central Bank was further notified on 9 May 2018 by the Danish FSA that the liquidators of the insurance company Alpha had filed a petition for bankruptcy.</p><p>As Alpha is a Danish-based insurance firm, it is subject to prudential supervision by the Danish FSA, and therefore the Central Bank had no role in this decision.  Alpha was selling non-life insurance policies in Ireland through the broker network on a freedom of services basis and that it also operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.</p><p>According to the information for Irish policyholders, published on Alpha&rsquo;s website <i></i>, on 26th June 2018, the insolvency estate commenced the distribution of information notices, to all policyholders and claimants of Alpha Insurance A/S in bankruptcy in Ireland.</p><p>The information notice contains information on the termination of insurance policies, the Danish Guarantee Fund (Garantifonden for Skadesforsikringsselskaber), information regarding the reporting of claims to the insolvency estate and the procedure for reporting new claims.</p><p>The insolvency administrator (Boris Frederiksen from Kammeradvokaten/Poul Schmith,) provided figures to the Central Bank in December 2018 on the latent defect policies. At that time, the total number of policies was 1,617, of which 1,163 were with the homeowner (these policies were transferred from the developer to the homeowner following completion of the build). The remaining 454 policies were on houses that were not finished and therefore the policy had not transferred to a homeowner at the time of the liquidation i.e. the policy remained with the developer.</p><p>The claims handler (BCR Legal Group Limited; &quot;BCR&quot;) confirmed to the Central Bank that its representative CRL wrote to the developers who had purchased these latent defects policies, on two occasions, to advise that Alpha had been placed in bankruptcy, that polices would be cancelled from 11 August 2018 and to request details of the owner of the properties insured under these policies. BCR subsequently wrote to all homeowners affected by the liquidation of Alpha, following receipt of their details from the developers, to advise that as Alpha had gone into liquidation, their latent defects policies had been terminated and that they should consider replacing this policy. BCR also provided these homeowners with an information sheet from the liquidators.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that as the issue of alternative latent defect insurance is a commercial matter it does not have any information as to the number of policyholders that may have had alternative cover organised. </p><p>My officials will however contact the insolvency administrator&rsquo;s office and the appointed claims handler <i>BCR</i>to see if any more specific information can be obtained and I will write to the Deputy with whatever response I receive.</p></reply>

This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p><p>It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not for the State to provide funding for such pension scheme provision.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.497.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600068#WRL00400"><p>I have administrative responsibility for the Civil Service Pension Schemes and exercise a central policy/authorisation role in relation to all other public service pension schemes. Insofar as pension increases are concerned, the main function of my Department is to determine, subject to appropriate Ministerial and Government approval, the pensions increase policy to apply, and to issue Circulars to Departments and public service bodies to authorise and give guidance on the application of the relevant increases. It is then a matter for each pension paying authority to ensure that effect is given to the pension increases authorised in the relevant Circulars, in the present instance, those set out in Circular 02/2018 with respect to pre-existing public service pension scheme members.</p>  <p>  The principle of pay parity underlies the pension increases sanctioned in this Circular. This means that pay increases, agreed as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA), are to be passed on to qualifying pensions of pre-existing public service pension scheme members, to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. </p>  <p>  Consequently, not all pension recipients will be due increases. If the salary on which the pension is based is lower than that of a serving staff member in the same grade and on the same scale point, then no increase will be due. For example, protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation meant that their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. If the current salaries of serving staff in the same grade and on the same scale point are not yet greater than those higher pay rates used in the pension calculation, even after the relevant pay increases under the PSSA have been applied to serving staff, no pension increase will be due. The same is true of any pensions that commenced prior to the FEMPI legislation that are linked to pay rates that have not yet been exceeded by the current salary rates of the relevant serving public service cohorts.</p></reply>

This approval process can take up to six months and is the final element of the planning process for the Scheme, after which the procurement process will commence to bring the scheme to construction stage.</p>  <p>  The scheme is being funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period 2018 &ndash; 2027.

In February 2018, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) within my Department surveyed the current digital signatures, public key infrastructure and the European regulatory landscape as set out by EU Regulation 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS). On foot of this survey, a further review of our national legislation was carried out on digital signatures.</p>  <p>  The culmination of this work arrived at recommendations relevant to digital signatures and the facilitation of the increase use within Ireland. The recommendations included the establishment of a body responsible for the regulatory oversight of Trust Service Providers (issuers of digital signatures, digital certificates and related digital services) operating in Ireland under the eIDAS regulation, a requirement for the operating of such providers; and the potential merit in a review of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, regarding its alignment with eIDAS. My Department is working with my colleagues in the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment, with responsibility for digital signatures, to advance the implementation of these recommendations.</p></reply>

This notably involves the establishment of a Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB), made up of representative Secretaries General of Government Departments and CEO/equivalent of public service organisations, in order to provide collective leadership at a strategic high level, champion innovation and to identify and learn from best practice.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference adopted by the PSLB at its inaugural meeting in March 2018 provide that it shall meet on a quarterly basis. The PSLB met on four occasions in 2018:  on 23 March 2018, 27 June 2018, 11 October 2018 and 11 December 2018.  The PSLB&rsquo;s next meeting is scheduled to take place on 28 March 2019.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW)  and the Local Authorities have been engaging pro-actively since the launch of the Plans to advance the implementation of these schemes. Engagement with the Local Authorities is on-going in relation to Springfield (Clonlara), Ballinasloe, Nenagh, Longford, Rahan, Castleconnell, Mohill, Leitrim, Clonaslee, Carrick-on-Shannon, Killaloe and for Limerick City, King's Island and environs and the procurement of consultants for the detailed design of these projects will commence in the near future.</p>  <p>  The proposed works in the Clonlara (Springfield) area were the subject of a Part VIII planning application by Clare County Council in mid 2018, which was subsequently withdrawn in order to more fully assess certain environmental matters. A further application will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Arising from the Government decision of Tuesday 12th  February 2019 in relation to capital reallocations related to the cost overrun on the National Children's Hospital, the Office of Public Works is reviewing the most appropriate means of achieving the required capital savings of &euro;3 million in the flood risk management area. Expenditure on any particular project or programme in any year is dependent on many variables related to the progress of the project and programme. The OPW can state that all capital projects committed to will be delivered.</p></reply>

The Retention of Records Bill is first of all designed to ensure that these records are not destroyed but are retained intact.  For this approach to be sustainable, due consideration has to be given to the assurances of confidentiality, set down in legislation, to all those who gave testimony or engaged with the bodies in any way, balanced with the wider public interest of retaining the records for posterity and eventually opening them to public inspection. The provisions of the Bill in regard to a lengthy sealing period reflect the need to strike that balance.    </p>  <p>  The Redress Scheme operated by the Residential Institutions Redress Board which was in place for people who had suffered abuse in a number of scheduled institutions is no longer open to new applicants.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise therefore that if the parents of the child, to whom the Deputy refers in his question, have concerns about the child&rsquo;s educational development they should raise them, in the first instance, with the principal of the school involved with a view to him/her raising the matter with their local NEPS service or assigned psychologist for advice, or if appropriate, direct intervention.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In identifying the requirement for additional school places, the Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places will arise. The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in addition to the Department's own databases. As the Deputy has indicated, major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in an area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). </p>  <p>  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new primary and post-primary school to be established in the Newcastle-Rathcoole school planning area as follows:</p>  <p>  - a new 8 classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Newcastle-Rathcoole/Saggart school planning area; and</p>  <p>  - a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Tallaght and Newcastle-Rathcoole school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  It is intended to deliver the two new schools as part of my Department's Design and Build programme in purpose-built accommodation on a shared site at Fortunestown Lane which is in the ownership of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. My Department has approved 3 temporary classrooms for Scoil Chronain NS Rathcoole to cater for immediate needs and these rooms are initially being provided for in Rathcoole Community Centre pending the arrival of 3 temporary classrooms at the school.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of acquiring additional land owned by South Dublin County Council adjoining the site of this school and the additional land offers the potential to enhance current facilities and support future development.  There is ongoing engagement with officials from South Dublin County Council on this matter.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard to the impact of the increased roll out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p><i></i>Schools are advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019.  An appeal can be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Additional special education teaching allocations will be made for schools who have increased enrolments to the extent that they achieve developing status, once school enrolments have been verified at October 2019, as opposed to being based on projected enrolments. As the actual enrolments must be taken account of, this process cannot take place until the new school year is underway.</p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>As revised updated allocations have recently been issued to schools, this process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.</p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. </p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2017 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools and to date, drawdowns from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,400 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity. This represents more than one third of all primary schools. This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2019, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. </p>  <p>  In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, I have asked my officials to review the service and raise this matter with the existing service provider. If the service provided cannot be upgraded under the existing contractual arrangements, my officials will include this school in the next available mini competition. Through this process, and subject to current contractual arrangements, it may be possible to provide improved service to this school, depending on the locally available infrastructure. The Schools Broadband Service Desk, managed on behalf of my Department by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education, will continue to liaise with the school on this matter.</p>  <p>  Currently, 3G/4G services are not available on the DES Schools Broadband Network due to the fact that Service Providers cannot guarantee bandwidth and contention across their networks as outlined in the Department specification of service requirements, and generally their service comes with a restrictive download limit. Connections supplied through the Schools Broadband Network have no download limit, and provide an integrated set of services to schools which includes broadband connectivity, and hosted services including content filtering, and security services including anti-virus control and a centralised firewall.</p>  <p>  The Department is obliged to adhere to procurement regulations, and must engage with the selected providers on the DES Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. Having awarded a school service to the highest placed tenderer, the Department is then required to work with that provider to install the service. This is the basis on which all state-funding must be utilised to ensure transparency and equal treatment for all schools and providers, and adherence to regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools The Group includes representatives of DES, PDST support service for schools, HEA-net and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The work of the Group will take account of the developments on the implementation of the Governments&rsquo; National Broadband Plan and its associated Intervention Strategy and the provision offered by industry.

As part of the rollout of the new Framework for Junior Cycle, Geography was one of five new subject specifications that were introduced to schools in September 2018.</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health. </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the status of Geography in junior cycle varied by school type. Geography was only a core subject in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools).</p>  <p>  It is important to note that currently some 92% of students across all schools choose to study Geography at Junior Cycle, although it is not compulsory in all schools. This is a clear indication that in respect of subjects like geography, schools make curricular decisions in the absence of directives and we expect this to continue.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to make geography a mandatory subject in schools.</p></reply>

I must stress that under the legislation establishing these bodies the bulk of their records would, on the dissolution of those bodies, fall to be destroyed. The Bill provides for the retention of the records, their transfer to the National Archives and their sealing and withholding from public inspection for a period of at least 75 years. </p>  <p>  The records of the redress bodies are unlike normal departmental records in that they contain information of a deeply personal nature that was provided to the bodies in the expectation that that information would be treated as confidential and private and the relevant legislation fully reflected that expectation. Accordingly, fresh legislation is required to address the range of issues involved. </p>  <p>  The Bill balances the right to confidentiality of all who engaged with the redress bodies with the public interest requirement to retain and eventually release the records. The legal advice available to me is that that balance can best be achieved by ensuring that all of the records are withheld from public inspection for a lengthy period and the Bill provides that that period will be at least 75 years. It is essential therefore that no access to these records be permitted for that period and accordingly, it is necessary to provide in the Bill for the dis-application of those sections of the National Archives Act 1986 that govern access to the records by individuals, government departments, etc., and related provisions.</p>  <p>  While the National Archives Act provides for a certification process for the withholding from public inspection in certain circumstances of records that are more than 30 years old it does not provide the necessary certainty that the records will be withheld from public scrutiny for a sufficiently lengthy period.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that the approach set out in the Bill is the appropriate way to proceed in relation to these historically important, extremely sensitive and unique records.</p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment and in consultation with the NCSE.</p>  <p>  Special Classes offer a supportive learning environment to students who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special education (NCSE), an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, coordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs. This includes taking account of the flow of students from primary into post primary. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  As approximately 1% of the school population require the support of a special class, it is not possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in the every school. </p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.   In this regard, the SENO may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability.</p>  <p>  The Council has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are sufficient post primary ASD special class placements in Limerick to meet identified need for the forthcoming school year.   </p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise parents whose children have special needs and identify available placements. They also support and advise schools in this area. Parents who are experiencing difficulties in locating a special class placement, should contact their local SENO. </p>  <p>  160 new special classes have been opened for the 2018/19 school year, which means there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. </p></reply>

This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p><p>The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Primary and Post primary Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools.</p><p>All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans or Student Support plans for children who are receiving additional teaching or care in schools. </p><p>Whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of Individual Education Plan, it is evident that the majority of schools do use some form of education planning to plan and record the support that they provide for pupils with special educational needs. This is considered to be both beneficial for schools and children and is regarded as best practice.  </p><p>The ongoing provision of planning will represent a continuation of the good practice that is occurring in the majority of schools.</p><p>In relation to training and support for teachers in the provision of special education needs support, the Department provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Regional Support Service, which has incorporated the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired and Hearing Impaired, provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers. </p><p>It is also enhancing the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behaviour. The SESS, has a role to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes. </p><p>Through applications to NCSE&rsquo;s Supports Service, schools and individual teachers can access support in all areas of special education, including support in relation to individualised educational planning.</p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) also provides guidance for schools in supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>NEPS works with schools through the Continuum of Support framework.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.  </p><p>NEPS psychologists provide advice and support around the identification of needs, the use of evidence-informed interventions and the monitoring of outcomes for individuals and groups of children. Psychologists can also advise and assist schools on effective whole-school practices, early intervention approaches and good deployment of Special Education Teaching supports.</p><p>This Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested. This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 at present.</p><p>Special classes by 160% to over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Special education teachers by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,400 at present.</p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

These Guidelines emphasise the importance of educational planning.  This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.  The level of support required by a student will depend on the needs identified.  To this end, supports may be provided for all students, for some students or for a few students. Tools such as the Student Support File, developed by the National educational Psychological Service (NEPS), are intended to equip schools to undertake such work. </p>  <p>  At the level of the individual student, the plan which is put in place should be developed through a collaborative process involving relevant teachers, parents/guardians, the pupils themselves and external professionals, as necessary. The plan should include clear, measurable learning targets relating to priority learning needs, and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the Continuum of Support process. While class and subject teachers in primary and in post-primary schools retain overall responsibility for the provision of education to their students, in most instances special education teachers will lead and develop the student&rsquo;s support plan. As outlined in the Guidelines for schools, by using the Student Support File and the Continuum of Support process effectively, special education teachers can be confident that the priorities they have identified for the students are appropriate to the needs and most likely to advance learning. The planning process for students should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review. </p>  <p>  The Looking at our School 2016 quality framework, which is used to inform the work of inspectors as they monitor and report on quality in schools makes clear that inspectors review the quality of both teachers&rsquo; preparation and planning for teaching, and their teaching practice in light of the published Guidelines.  The extent to which inspectors focus on plans for students varies depending on the focus of the inspection model in use in any inspection. For example, in conducting specialised evaluations of provision for children with special educational needs at either primary or post-primary levels, inspectors will have regard to, inter alia, the manner in which teachers&rsquo; plans, either for individuals or groups as appropriate, identify clear, relevant learning objectives that are contextualised to pupils&rsquo; learning needs and the extent to which those plans facilitate appropriate provision for the learners concerned.</p></reply>

Under Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, in accordance with the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017). In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE.  </p>  <p>  The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020. </p>  <p>  A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2 (NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting that there is scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular between student placement and the university experience. These findings will be considered by the Teaching Council in the course of its work.</p></reply>

The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. </p><p>Transfer of patronage and consultation with school communities on reconfiguration is a matter for the current patron in the first instance. Any concerns or views that parents have should be discussed with the school patron.</p><p>The Reconfiguration process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. </p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. ETBs then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. </p><p>The first Identification Phase<b></b>of the pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide, including the Malahide &amp;amp; Portmarnock area. It is envisaged that the Identification Phase reports from the initial areas will be published in the first half of this year.  </p><p>Following the completion of the Identification Phase, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase, which would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. </p><p>The transfer to a new patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community. The Department envisages that such consultation would include an outline of contingencies that may be put in place for parents who wish for their children to retain the current ethos of the school, having regard to local circumstances.</p><p>The Implementation Phase would also provide an opportunity for potential multi-denominational and non-denominational patrons to engage in a consultative process with the existing school community, affording the best possible opportunity for patron bodies themselves to inform parents as to the unique characteristics of their schools. This may include a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. </p><p>The Implementation Phase of the process has yet to formally commence. Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. </p><p>In relation to the specific school referenced by the Deputy, the existing school patron, the Dublin Archbishop, would lead the Implementation Phase of the process. </p><p>I understand that the Dublin Archdiocese representatives are in the process of holding meetings with a number of primary schools under their patronage in this area to provide information to them on the process rather than as part of the formal Implementation Phase of the Schools Reconfiguration process.</p><p>It is also possible for any school community to directly engage their current patron, outside of the main reconfiguration process, and to seek a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron, fast-tracking the patronage reassignment.  Already the first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  I encourage any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision to contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes.  It is open to any school in the area to make application to the NCSE to establish a class. </p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  In this regard, the SENO may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability. This work is currently underway in the area concerned.</p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This programme is being informed by the Mazars Review of the Department&rsquo;s Governance, Funding and Accountability arrangements for Education Support Centres. The Mazars report has been circulated to all Education Centres. In addition, there have been developments in governance requirements for state funded bodies as outlined in the Code of Practice for State Bodies which need to be reflected in the sector.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group has been established to lead on the development of a programme of actions for the modernisation of governance and accountability arrangements for Education Centres and to oversee its implementation.

The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.</p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at , in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  </p><p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. </p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>As this question relates to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p></reply>

Everything that can be done should be done to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice and to ensure that those responsible provide redress to the victims.</p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency (SCA) is mandated to deal with litigation arising from abuse in schools but there isn't a redress scheme as such for victims of abuse in primary schools.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is referring to the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the Louise O'Keeffe case, the Government agreed in December 2014 that out of court settlements be offered in those extant cases of school child sexual abuse being brought against the State where the cases come within the terms of the judgment and satisfy the Statute of Limitations.  The SCA, who manage such cases on behalf of the State, has made settlement offers which have been accepted in 6 cases.</p>  <p>   In July 2015, the Government approved proposals to offer ex-gratia payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in such cases against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the European Court&rsquo;s judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued. Persons who believe that their cases come within the criteria can contact the SCA and provide supporting evidence. Where there is a disagreement between the SCA and the individual as to whether their circumstances come within the terms of the European Court&rsquo;s judgment, the application can be reviewed by an independent assessor.  </p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) website has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education and their preferred language of instruction.

Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>The patronage process for the 4 post-primary schools and 12 primary schools to be established in 2019 has been completed. The patronage process for the schools to be established in September 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will commence later this year, significantly ahead of their due opening dates. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and the Department&rsquo;s website ().</p></reply>

Sponsors were to be advised that the total increased grant, less employers PRSI, should be paid to supervisors.  This was implemented by F&Aacute;S.</p>  <p>  The recommendation also stated that for future pay increases, the supervisors should have a pay relationship with and be &lsquo;linked proportionally&rsquo; to Community Training Centre (CTC) Managers.  Any benefit to the claimants arising from the pay relationship should be paid in accordance with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was in place at the time.  Since then, LTI Community Training Supervisors have received increases under national agreements, in line with CTC Managers. </p>  <p>  The increases to salary from the implementation of the Public Service Stability Agreement provided for the restoration of pay which was reduced as a result of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts (FEMPI).

This goes beyond what might be normally envisaged in a post-project review and will provide useful information that will be relevant to the wider school building programme. The review will incorporate detailed condition surveys of the buildings, as well as comparing the operation and maintenance provision in both PPP and traditional schools.</p>  <p>  The more detailed nature of this review responds directly to a recommendation in the 2004 C&amp;AG report on the Pilot Schools that, at the appropriate time, the costs and benefits of adopting the PPP approach should be assessed relative to the performance of a comparable group of schools procured conventionally.  In line with the requirements under the Public Spending Code for post project reviews, it is intended to publish the key findings of the Review towards the end of 2019.  It will also be determined whether the approach taken provides a suitable framework for further PPP reviews.</p>  <p>  The review of the Pilot Schools will be the first formal Post Project Review of PPP projects carried out by the Department.  However, reviews in the form of lessons learned exercises have been undertaken in relation to PPP projects delivered in the education sector and such projects are also the subject of ongoing review and monitoring. Prior to handover to the Department, the NDFA conducts its own internal review of the procurement and construction phases and identifies any lessons which should inform future approaches.   Lessons learnt reports in respect of Schools Bundle 1, 2 and 3 have previously been shared with the Public Accounts Committee.</p>  <p>  Important lessons learnt from earlier PPP projects have been incorporated into more recent approaches. In particular, the Project Agreement, which provides the contractual basis for the PPP arrangement, has been regularly updated to ensure that it provides a robust framework for measuring the performance of the private partner and protecting the interests of the State over the lifetime of the project.</p>  <p>  The Department is also tracking the actual enrolments in PPP schools against the long-term projected enrolments. Enrolment data is provided on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This is important in assessing, as per the Public Spending Code, that the basis on which a project was undertaken proved correct and that the planned outcomes were the appropriate responses to actual public needs.</p>  <p>  A lessons learned exercise in relation to Schools Bundle 5, the PPP project impacted by the collapse of Carillion, has been initiated and will be completed once the final projects in that Bundle have been delivered.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter of the children, the subject of the Deputy's question, and find that although a NEPS psychologist was involved with both children, and on two occasions each, in 2018 there are currently, I understand, no outstanding requests for involvement of NEPS by the school with either boy.</p>  <p>  I would advise therefore that if the parents of the children, have concerns about their current situation they might raise them, in the first instance, with the principal of the school involved with a view to her raising the matter with their local NEPS service for further advice, or if appropriate, direct intervention, including assessment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This work is being led by the Teacher Supply Steering Group established in March 2018, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession.</p><p>The Steering Group is overseeing the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018 with twenty-two actions in the four policy areas. These actions include:</p><p>- Following engagement with the HEA, a number of HEIs will provide new post primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish. The HEIs also plan to commence more new undergraduate ITE programmes in 2020.</p><p>- The HEA is engaging with HEIs regarding the development of programmes to upskill existing teachers in targeted subject areas and to examine potential for flexible ITE programmes.</p><p>- An additional &euro;1 million has been allocated in the current academic year to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for Professional Master of Education (PME) students who are experiencing financial difficulty.</p><p>- The Teaching Council, at the request of my Department, is reviewing the implementation of school placement guidelines for student teachers, with a particular focus on school/HEI partnerships.</p><p>- In the current school year the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes were suspended.</p><p>- My Department is currently undertaking an analysis of the potential for a primary school substitute teacher supply panel scheme.</p><p>- My Department has recently published Circular 0015/2019 with details of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools, commencing in the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>- In December 2018 a national campaign for the promotion of the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media. The campaign is supported by a new webpage providing information about teaching as a career ().</p><p>- A Consultative Forum was held in November 2018 to ensure that all stakeholders were kept aware of the measures being considered and implemented and to facilitate their input and participation.</p><p>- Five regional focus groups were held in December 2018 and January 2019 giving teachers, principals and parents an opportunity to consider and respond to the Action Plan and to contribute new ideas.</p><p>- The development of an online teacher and substitute teacher recruitment portal is being explored.</p><p>The Steering Group and the various working groups reporting to it continue to meet on a regular basis and I hope to be in a position to announce further developments in this area over the coming months.</p></reply>

Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion, including giving priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school known as a feeder school.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. </p><p>The selection process used by schools and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018.</p><p>The overall objective of the Act is to provide a new framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is structured, fair and transparent</p></reply>

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. Some 1,400 primary schools are currently on download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2019, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment.</p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p></reply>

The AEGS are now based in the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p><p>There are a total of 37 AEGS across the 16 ETBs. Currently, there are no vacancies in the AEGS in 14 of the ETBs. There are a total of three vacancies in the AEGS in two of the ETBs. I understand that the processes are underway to fill these vacancies.</p><p>There is a commitment in the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2014-2019 to develop a FET Guidance Strategy. My Department is currently engaging with consultants on the finalisation of an overall Career Guidance Review. The Career Guidance Review is a comprehensive review of guidance in the education sector and will set out the overall landscape of guidance tools and provision in the education sector.  The findings and recommendations of this review will inform the development of the FET guidance services.  This includes the AEGS but also guidance delivered in Post Leaving Certificate colleges and other settings.</p><p>I understand that to date there has been no formal inter-Departmental meeting between my Department, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection specifically on the adult guidance service, although issues relating to guidance, referrals and jobseeker and learner supports are regularly discussed in broader meetings.</p><p>Please see funding figures for the Adult Guidance Service from 2005 - 2017 in appendix 1.</p><p>The total beneficiaries of the AEGS from 2015-2017 is also attached for the Deputy's information, at appendix 2.</p><p>The National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) provides reports to inform my Department and SOLAS on the work of the 37 AEGS annually.

This is the most recent set of data available. The Deputy should note that the OLCS is designed to enable schools to record all absences (substitutable and non-substitutable) for all staff members paid directly on the Department&rsquo;s payroll and to make claims for substitution. Accordingly, data on absences in ETB schools is not available. In addition separate data is not available in relation to English medium schools and Gaelscoileanna.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, management bodies and schools have, in recent years, reported difficulties in recruiting teachers.

It is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; promotion of the teaching profession. </p><p>On 8th November 2018, I published the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which contains twenty-two actions under the four policy headings.</p><p>A number of specific measures are being taken to increase the pool of available substitute teachers.  These include:  </p><p>- For the 2018/19 school year, the restrictions on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed were suspended. </p><p>- Retiring teachers were given information that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days, they must maintain registration with the Teaching Council. </p><p>- My Department is currently undertaking an analysis of the potential for a primary school substitute teacher supply panel scheme. </p><p>- The development of an online substitute teacher recruitment portal is being explored. </p><p>- My Department is considering the removal of the restriction on job-sharing teachers undertaking substitute work.</p><p>Other actions include: </p><p>- In December 2018 my Department launched a national campaign to promote the teaching profession across a number of platforms including radio and digital media. The campaign is supported by a new website providing information about teaching as a career <i>(www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms)</i>. </p><p>- Following engagement with the HEA, HEIs have put in place new post primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes to commence in 2019 in a number of priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are also planned to commence in 2020. </p><p>- The HEA is to engage with HEIs to explore the development of programmes to upskill existing teachers in targeted subject areas and to examine potential for flexible ITE programmes. </p><p>- The Teaching Council is undertaking a review of the implementation of the guidelines for student teacher school placements. </p><p>- In the current academic year, an additional &euro;1m has been allocated to the  Student Assistance Fund for Professional Master of Education (PME) students, increasing the overall fund to &euro;10.1m. </p><p>- The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.</p><p>- My Department published Circular 0015/2019 with details of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools, commencing in the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>In addition, following from the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education: </p><p>- An Irish-medium Masters in Education for  primary and post-primary teachers, including principals, commenced in September 2018 in Mary Immaculate College.</p><p>- Marino Institute of Education will, from 2019, provide a 4-year Irish-medium B Ed for primary teachers.</p><p>The Steering Group and the various working groups reporting to it continue to meet on a regular basis and I hope to be in a position to announce further measures to support teacher supply over the coming months. <div><b>Substitutable days where no substitute cover was claimed, 2017/18</b></div></p><p><b><i>Primary</i></b><table><tr><th><div><b>School year</b></div></th><th><div><b>Substitutable days (excl. weekends &amp;amp; closures)</b></div></th><th><div><b>Number of days where a substitute claim was received</b></div></th><th><div><b>Number of substitutable days where no substitution cover claimed including days where a substitute teacher was not required</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>1/9/2017 &ndash; 30/6/2018</td><td>750,359</td><td>647,137</td><td>92,299 (12.30%)</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Post Primary Schools (Community and Voluntary Secondary Schools)</i></b><table><tr><th><div><b>School Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>Substitutable days (excl. weekends &amp;amp; closures)</b></div></th><th><div><b>Number of days where a substitute claim was received</b></div></th><th><div><b>Number of substitutable days where no substitution cover claimed including days where a substitute teacher was not required </b></div></th></tr><tr><td>1/9/2017&ndash; 01/6/2018</td><td>261,461</td><td>235,853</td><td>25,608(9.79%)</td></tr></table></p><p>This information has been extracted from the Online Claims System (OLCS), which is designed to enable schools to record all absences (substitutable and non-substitutable) for all staff members paid directly on the Department&rsquo;s payroll and to make claims for substitution.</p><p>There are a number of absence types on the OLCS which are identified as substitutable for payroll purposes, but for which, in certain cases, no substitute is required to be recruited or where the school is not entitled to recruit a sub teacher. For this reason the number of substitutable absences where no substitution cover is claimed is overstated. Such absence types include:</p><p>- Teacher Professional Development: In some cases schools close for teacher CPD. Such absences are recorded as substitutable, but in the case of whole school closure, no substitute is employed.</p><p>- Force Majeure/Illness in Family: The first day of this leave is not substitutable.</p><p>- Self-Certified (Uncertified) Sick Leave: For payroll purposes this leave is recorded as substitutable.  However, it is in only substitutable in smaller primary schools for multiple absences of teachers on the same day. For other school types, self-certified sick leave absences are non-substitutable.  </p><p>- Visiting Teachers: Visiting teachers must have their leave recorded on OLCS but, due to the nature of their posts, they may not always be replaced by a substitute.</p><p>- Principal Release Time: This leave is recorded as substitutable but in certain cases, where schools have clustered, these absences are covered by teachers appointed to Principal Release Time Posts. In such cases no substitute is required.</p><p>- Supervision and Substitution - Some substitutable absences in post-primary schools are covered by teachers whom have signed up for the Supervision and Substitution Scheme. Accordingly, claims will not be submitted for some absences.</p></reply>

The Civil Registration Bill 2019 makes technical amendments to sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 that provide for registration, and re-registration, of births of donor-conceived children. This legislation is being progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of priority. Committee Stage was taken in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28 February 2019 and Report/Final Stage is scheduled for 27 March 2019. It is the only non-Brexit Bill to be introduced by the Government in the current legislative session.    </p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who has policy responsibility in this area, has stated her intention that Part 9 will be commenced immediately following enactment of the Bill. I will work with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to ensure that commencement is brought about as soon as possible following enactment of the Bill.   </p>  <p>  The operation of these sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is dependent on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act, which includes provisions for determination of parentage on which registrations, and re-registrations, will be based. This is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, who is working to ensure that commencement of these provisions is brought about as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  These are complex issues that require the involvement of more than just one Department. Officials from my Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Health and the General Register Office are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.    </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service.   </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.   </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Co-ordination of national efforts in this area is the responsibility of my Department. </p>  <p>  Ireland has ratified the principal international Human Trafficking treaties:</p>  <p>  - The Palermo Protocol (2000) to the UN Convention against Organised Crime</p>  <p>  - The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings  (2005)</p>  <p>  In the EU and Ireland, the following legislation is relevant:</p>  <p>  - EU Anti Trafficking Directive (2011/36/EU)</p>  <p>  - Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013</p>  <p>  On 4 February this year, Ireland ratified the ILO Forced Labour Protocol, which reinforces the international legal framework for combatting all forms of forced labour, including trafficking in persons. This initiative, by my colleague the Minister for Business Enterprise and Innovation, puts Ireland among the group known as &ldquo;50 for Freedom&rdquo;, which stems from an ILO initiative to encourage member countries to ratify the Protocol by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been established to coordinate delivery of national strategy. On 6 March, I met with the Garda Commissioner to discuss this despicable crime and I welcome his and his officers' commitment to this task.</p>  <p>  A number of State bodies provide care and practical support to victims, including the HSE, the Reception and Integration Agency, the Legal Aid Board, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and Tusla.  The International Organisation for Migration provides assistance in relation to returning victims to their country of origin.  Once a person has been identified as a victim, they are brought into the National Referral Mechanism to receive State supports. Victims receive medical care; accommodation; legal advice; help with their immigration status; and help to travel home. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to several Non-Governmental Organisations for their work to provide support to victims of trafficking. I am also funding several research and awareness raising programmes in this field. </p>  <p>  A training programme is ongoing for Garda members and my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have an ongoing programme of awareness raising and training to a variety of targeted groups who may come into contact with victims, including frontline Government bodies such as the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Border Management Unit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  Awareness-raising presentations are provided to schools, third-level institutions and support agencies.</p>  <p>  Each year in October, Ireland marks EU Anti Human Trafficking Day with an awareness raising programme. In 2018, my Department hosted a screening of an award winning documentary, &ldquo;The Price of Sex&rdquo; alongside a talk from a survivor of sex trafficking. My officials have also worked with RT&Eacute; to provide accurate information for use in documentaries and dramas. </p>  <p>  Information on trafficking in Ireland is publicly available on the &ldquo;Blue Blindfold&rdquo; website, www.blueblindfold.gov.ie, which is maintained by my Department. Information leaflets and branded merchandise are available for distribution at awareness raising events.</p></reply>

While not all Garda Stations are training stations, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including some 207 who attested on 8 March, the first attestation of  this year. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the general allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the recruitment of additional Garda&iacute; and accordingly has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.  </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link: </p><p>For additional and more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

Each Division is then responsible for the allocation of its budget amongst its Districts. As District expenditure is not currently accounted for on an activity basis, it is not possible to isolate the cost of roads policing from other policing duties and costs.  The Garda authorities also point out that members who are not attached to the Roads Policing may be assigned to traffic duties, depending on operational need.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will however wish to be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently implementing a Roster and Duty Management System (RDMS) which will in future facilitate the costing of various duties, including Roads Policing.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>With regard to numbers of Garda&iacute; attached to divisions and stations or in particular roles or units much of the data requested is on my Department&rsquo;s website and is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>For general information on Garda Facts and Figures below is the link to the website:</p><p>More specific data for the Dublin Metropolitan Region North and North Central are available via the following links:</p><p>Overall Garda Workforce Strength 2006 to January 2019</p><p>Garda Numbers by Division District and Station 2009 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Garda Numbers by Division 2006 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Roads Policing Unit 2009 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Community Garda Strength 2008 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Garda Reserve Strength 2009 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Civilian Staff by Division and Station 2010 to 31 January 2019</p><p>Allocation of Probationer Garda&iacute; by Division and Station 2014 to January 2019</p><p>My officials are currently in the process of developing the website to provide additional information and data about other roles and units and I would encourage the deputy and colleagues to avail of this resource. </p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate a number of points regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which I believe are important to emphasise.</p><p>- Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>- When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. These national specialist units which form Garda Special Crime Operations are national units which support the work of the 28 Garda Divisions across the Country and are consequently not broken down by Division. Other examples of these include: the Special Detective Unit (SDU) which is responsible for the investigation of threats to state security and the monitoring of persons who pose a threat to the security of the State on both national and international fronts. The Unit also provides security for visiting VIPs, cash in transit movements and armed response and is the operational wing of the Witness Security Programme. The highly trained and equipped specialist intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is also part of SDU. As the Deputy will appreciate, for security and operational reasons the strength of the SDU, ERU, Regional Support Units and the Special Tactics and Operational Command (STOC) Unit cannot be provided.</p><p>- There are Garda&iacute; with specialist training in public order policing in each Division who are available to be called upon when required to police events with an increased risk of a public order incident occurring, such as, protests or large scale public events. The number of Garda&iacute; called upon is dependent on the nature of the event. As such there are no Garda&iacute; assigned to public order units on a full time basis.</p><p>- Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs) are specially trained to fulfil a key role in implementing the Garda Diversion Programme. Their role includes the administration of formal and informal cautions as well as appropriate supervision of children who have been admitted to the Diversion Programme, as provided in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 200 trainees who passed out from the college on 8<sup>th</sup>March. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the tables attached additional data in relation to the current strength of Garda national units,  and in relation to numbers of community Garda&iacute;

The current procedure for a person to be released from wardship is as follows: </p><p>- If a person wishes to leave wardship the application is usually made on his/her behalf by his/her committee.  However, if the person applies directly to the Wards of Court Office that office will correspond directly with that person.  A letter is sufficient to commence the process. </p><p>- A report from a medical practitioner saying that the ward is capable of managing his/her property and person must be lodged.  The Wards of Court Office will then ask a court medical visitor to attend the ward and to provide a report for the benefit of the court.  If that report also confirms that the ward has capacity, the matter is listed before the President of the High Court at the next available wards of court motion list, which is usually on Mondays during the legal term.</p><p>- If the President of the High Court is satisfied with the medical evidence, an order is made discharging the person from wardship and remitting him/her control of his/her assets.</p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that the process can be completed in a matter of weeks, depending on the time taken to procure the medical reports. However, if there is an urgency to the application it will be prioritised by the Wards of Court Office.</p></reply>

Residents are informed with regard to their eligibility to vote in particular elections and on arrangements for registering as voters.</p><p>The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration within my Department has supported a number of events focused on encouraging political participation of migrants in local politics.</p><p>Multi-lingual material has been developed for voter registration information and for the local and European elections. This information is accessible and available on the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government website.</p><p>RIA has recently revised its policy in relation to canvassing and political activity in accommodation centres. This is in line with actions in the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2020 which focus on efforts to ensure that the political system becomes more representative of the broader population.</p><p>In the 30 day period leading up to a referendum or election (local, national or European) in which residents may be eligible to vote, canvassers and political representatives may leave material for display in a designated area, e.g. on the public notice board / tables in the accommodation centre for the information of residents.</p><p>Canvassers and candidates may arrange to meet by appointment with residents in communal spaces, in keeping with the agreed procedures for visitors to centres as outlined in &lsquo;RIA House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures - Revised January 2019&rsquo;. Centre managers should put measures in place to facilitate such visits.</p><p>In instances where a centre is comprised of individual accommodation units and includes mobile homes, houses and self-catering apartments, candidates and canvassers may be facilitated where they wish to call &lsquo;door to door&rsquo;. However, there is no requirement on the part of a resident to engage with any candidate unless they choose to do so.</p><p>Centres should display notices in prominent locations throughout the accommodation centre within the 30 day period leading up to a referendum or local election indicating that:-</p><p>1.  A referendum/local elections is being held with the polling date specified;</p><p>2.  Residents in accommodation centres with the right to vote in local elections may be approached by candidates and/or canvassers on their behalf;</p><p>3.  They are not required to engage with any candidate and/or canvasser;</p><p>4.  It is the responsibility of each resident to ensure that they are registered to vote within an appropriate time frame. </p><p>Given the particular nature of the accommodation provided in centres, there are factors that limit unrestricted access by candidates to the private living quarters of residents. These include the communal nature of the accommodation system and the many practical and logistical difficulties that would arise for centre managers in providing unsupervised access in circumstances where families and children live together.  </p><p>The general policy ensures that there are no restrictions placed on residents&rsquo; voting rights, or on their rights to access whatever information that candidates wish to convey to them, or on any rights to meet with candidates in the public areas of centres.  It also ensures privacy in the residential units and the on-going protection of children in the centre.</p><p>There is an opportunity for the Friends of the Centre group at each centre to provide information to residents on how to register to vote and on the importance of local government within the political structure of the State.  The Friends of the Centre groups can also raise awareness in an informal way about the importance of voting.</p></reply>

At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  </p>  <p>  I am further informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established a Working Group to formulate a "National Strategy to Deal with Assaults against the Person".  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has included knife crime as part of the remit of the working group tasked with drafting the strategy.  </p>  <p>  The working group will continue to monitor the prevalence and frequency of individuals carrying a knife and knife-like instruments on their person, whilst devising a strategy to tackle assaults against the person, including assaults involving the use of a knife. The working group is expected to present a draft strategy to the Garda Executive for consideration by July 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department also wrote to the Garda authorities in February 2019 to seek an update on the recent work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling knife-related crime, and in particular the progress being made by Garda&iacute; to improve the quality of knife crime statistics recorded on the PULSE system. </p>  <p>  When a response is received, and has been fully considered by my Department, I hope to able to provide the Deputy with an update.</p></reply>

As I have said, I envisage this study also examining the process of domestic homicide reviews and experience to date in other jurisdictions, with a view to making recommendations in relation to their application in this jurisdiction. I intend to consult relevant parties, including my Government colleagues and relevant experts, before finalising the terms of reference. I will examine any recommendations made, including any legislative change that may be proposed.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Protective Services Bureau is currently developing new policies and procedures to inform its approach to domestic homicide reviews in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is envisaged that these reviews will examine the sufficiency of Garda policies in this area, their interactions with other external agencies and with the individuals and family concerned.</p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Commissioner that the reviews will be a separate exercise to the investigation of the domestic homicide. They are not a review of the Garda investigation, a disciplinary enquiry or a fault finding exercise. Their purpose is to serve as a lessons learned review to facilitate better practice in the approach to domestic abuse. My view is this is a useful and necessary practise and will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in seeking to continuously improve their approach to domestic abuse.  As the Deputy is aware, a range of other agencies may be involved in such cases in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The development of a special unit to investigate murder-suicides is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.

There is a distinction between the criteria that must be met to be recognised as a refugee or a person eligible for subsidiary protection.</p>  <p>  To be recognised as a refugee, an applicant must be a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of (i) race, (ii) religion, (iii) nationality, (iv) political opinion or (v) membership of a particular social group, is outside his or her country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail of the protection of that country, or a stateless person, who, being outside of his or her country of former habitual residence for the same reasons as mentioned above, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it and who is not excluded from eligibility for refugee status for certain reasons.</p>  <p>  Subsidiary Protection is granted to a person who does not qualify as a refugee but where the international protection officer considers that the person faces a real risk of suffering serious harm in his or her country of origin. The precise definition is that a person eligible for subsidiary protection is a person (i) who is not a national of a Member State of the European Union, (ii) who does not qualify as a refugee, (iii) in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or she, if returned to his or her country of origin/country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm, and who is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; and (iv) who is not excluded from eligibility for subsidiary protection for certain reasons. </p>  <p>  Serious harm means: (i) death penalty or execution, (ii) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of a person in his or her country of origin/country of former habitual residence, or (iii) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict.</p></reply>

This made significant changes to fines payment and default procedures including abolishing  default orders and introducing alternative ways to deal with unpaid fines.</p><p>It is therefore not possible to compare the present regime introduced in Jan 2016 to the period from 1st Jan 2013 to 10<sup>th</sup>January 2016, due to the fact that prior to the introduction of the 2014 Fines Act, Court orders imposing the payment of a fine included a default period of imprisonment if the fine was not paid. </p><p>I am aware that issues have been experienced in the implementation of the Act, which was introduced as a reforming and progressive measure and was widely supported in the Oireachtas.  My Department has been working with stakeholders including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to identify what steps can be taken to address enforcement matters. As a result of this process , I have formed the view that a review of the Act is necessary, having regard to its policy objectives and the enforcement issues that have arisen, and my Department will be commencing this review with the key stakeholders shortly. </p><p>Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.  The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case, including the decision to make an attachment order, a recovery order or a community service order  is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. While statistics show that at present there are approximately 84,925 persons who have failed to pay fines imposed, the position is that a large number of the outstanding cases are still live before the courts.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the decision whether to purchase or sell property on behalf of a ward of court. In most cases the purchase of house property arises for wards who have specialised needs relating to their welfare and accommodation. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that there is no significant delay in the processing of applications for purchase of property on behalf of wards of court. All applications are examined promptly and the proposed order prepared for examination by the President of the High Court. The President examines such proposals on a weekly basis. If there is any urgency to the matter the proposal is processed immediately by the case officer and the President will make himself available at short notice to deal with the application. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that when it is proposed to purchase a property, the Wards of Court Office will usually require an independent valuation and other relevant documentation such as an occupational therapist's report either confirming that the accommodation is suitable for the ward's needs or setting out the improvements or alterations which are required to make the property suitable. That application is put to the President of the High Court for his decision.  A Court Order is drafted, approved and signed to allow the ward's guardian or committee to complete the purchase on the ward's behalf.  As a result of these necessary procedures, it may take some weeks to approve the purchase of a property on behalf of a ward.</p></reply>

At the outset, I want to assure the Deputy that the safety of both staff and prisoners is of paramount concern to me as Minister and to management of the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Irish Prison Service that the cause of the fire at Midlands prison has not been fully determined as the investigation by the Prison Service Fire Safety Officer is on-going. That investigation includes liaison with the local fire service who responded to the incident. The fire was contained to a particular room at the prison and resulted in the transfer of a number of prisoners from Midlands Prison to Portlaoise Prison as a contingency measure, rather than their evacuation from the prison.  I have been advised that all fire safety systems operated correctly during the incident.</p>  <p>  More generally, in relation to fire safety, over the past three years 42 maintenance requests relating to the fire safety system have been lodged by staff, all of which have been acted upon.</p>  <p>  The maintenance of the prison fire safety system is covered under a service contract and all systems are serviced in line with applicable contracts. The latest servicing of the prison fire safety system commenced on the 4th February 2019 and was completed on the 20th February 2019.  I can also confirm the fire suppression system was serviced on the 19th February 2019.</p>  <p>  As distinct from the 42 maintenance requests in a 3 year period, I have also been advised by the IPS that there have been no complaints related to fire safety reported to the management of Midlands Prison in 2018 nor to date in 2019.</p>  <p>  In that same period (2018 and to date in 2019) there have been 553 general health and safety concerns reported to management at the Prison, none of which were deemed to be major defects.  They ranged from traffic management to issues concerning prison cell doors.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that all issues were reported to the Building Services Division of the Irish Prison Service for action.  Notwithstanding the ongoing investigation into the cause of the fire, the IPS has confirmed that none of these defects, if rectified, would have in any way avoided the recent fire.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that where urgent maintenance is required Midlands Prison can request the services of the Building Services Division of the Irish Prison Service, with requests prioritised for action through the support contractors in place across the Irish Prison Service Estate.</p></reply>

This will be done by legislation to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures. These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill, which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help to ensure that the family court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.  Once the General Scheme has been approved by Government, it will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the family court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes.</p>  <p>  In 2018, a three-person task force comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  The work of this group is at an advanced stage.  Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements.</p></reply>

There are also 28 Garda Reserves and 77 Garda civilian staff attached to the Galway Division.

The Commissioner has informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Galway Division.</p><p>The Western Region Garda Headquarters, Galway, was officially opened on 20 July 2018, and is open 24 hours a day.</p><p>The headquarters includes a number of important facilities for delivery of policing services to the community of Galway and the Western Region including:</p><p>-  Garda Analysis Service,</p><p>- Regional Tasking Unit and Regional Detective Superintendent,</p><p>- Regional Health and Safety Advisor,</p><p>- Assistant Commissioner and Staff,</p><p>- Chief Superintendent and Staff,</p><p>- Crime Superintendent, Detective Inspector and Staff,</p><p>- Assistant Principal and Divisional Administration, Finance and HR Staff,</p><p>- Northern and Western Bi Regional Communications; - 999 Centre and CAD Mobile Dispatch (Command and Control),</p><p>- Continuous Professional Development / In-service,</p><p>- Superintendent i/c Governance, Performance and Standards, </p><p>- Divisional Protective Service Unit,</p><p>- Crime Prevention Officer,</p><p>- Juvenile Liaison Officers,</p><p>- Divisional Roads Policing Unit,</p><p>- Scenes of Crime Unit,</p><p>- Divisional Drugs Unit,</p><p>- Immigration Unit, </p><p>- Custody Suite,</p><p>- Public Office,</p><p>- Towing Office,</p><p>- PSV Applications Office,</p><p>- PEMS Store, </p><p>- Radio / Telecommunications Office,</p><p>- Dog Kennels and Associated Offices,</p><p>- PSV Garage.</p><p>The Garda strength of the Galway Division from 2009 to 31 January 2019 as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link below.</p><p>The Garda staff strength attached to the Galway Division from 2009 to 31 January 2019 as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link below.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link below:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

There are severe penalties in place for firearm offences under the Firearms Acts.</p>  <p>  Every application for a firearm certificate is considered on its individual merits and an application cannot be granted by a Garda Superintendent unless certain conditions, set out in law, are met. These include, amongst others, that the person can be permitted to possess a firearm without danger to the public safety and that the person has a good reason for requiring the firearm. </p>  <p>  New conditions regarding an application were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2006. These conditions include the requirement of applicants to provide two referees to attest to their character, and also a requirement on each applicant to provide written consent for an issuing officer to make any enquiries in relation to the applicant&rsquo;s medical history from a health professional. </p>  <p>  Certain firearms are &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; under Irish legislation (e.g. such as large calibre handguns) and these attract additional conditions to be met over and above the standard requirements. These conditions include that the applicant has demonstrated that the firearm is the only type of firearm that is appropriate for the purpose for which it is required. Decisions on restricted firearms are made by a Garda Chief Superintendent.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 2A of the Firearms Act, 1925, as amended, a person over 14 years of age can apply for a firearms training certificate.  Such a certificate authorises the person to possess a firearm only while carrying and using the firearm for hunting or target shooting and under the supervision of a specified person over 18 years of age who holds a firearms certificate in respect of the firearm concerned.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deciding officer in any individual case may impose other conditions in the interests of public safety and security.  An application for a training certificate, where the applicant is under 16 years of age, shall be accompanied by the written consent of the applicant's parent or guardian. Furthermore, Paragraph 8 of Statutory Instrument 493 of 2010: EC (Acquisition and Possession of Weapons and Ammunition) (Amendment) Regulations, provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to sell a firearm to which EU Firearms Directives apply to a person under 18 years of age.</p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for the revocation of a firearms certificate, if the conditions which applied to the grant of the firearm in the first instance are no longer met.</p>  <p>  A substantial review of firearms licensing, including consultation with the public, stakeholders and the relevant Oireachtas Committee, was undertaken in recent years. A number of measures identified as a result of this review are being progressed by my Department. These include a ban on new licences for semi automatic centre fire rifles and  the establishment of a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 3E of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended, the Garda Commissioner conducts an annual review of the operation of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2009.

Longford in April 2000. In his Report, Mr. Justice Barr agreed with the view of the Irish College of Psychiatrists that psychiatric assessments in relation to firearms certificate applications as a statutory requirement were not appropriate. </p>  <p>  Regarding the provision of medical reports, Mr Justice Barr&rsquo;s Report stated:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;The submissions and evidence on this issue from a wide range of experts to which I have already referred, when considered in conjunction with Lord Cullen&rsquo;s opinion in his Dunblane Report (with which there appears to be general agreement) establishes that there should not be any statutory requirement for the mandatory provision of medical certificates by applicants for gun licences or renewals thereof. In the light of the evidence presented on this topic, it is evident that there are major practical difficulties in implementing such a statutory requirement. These include the fact that in many instances a gun licence applicant&rsquo;s general medical practitioner may not have sufficient knowledge of his or her patient, or specialist expertise to make an appropriate assessment and the time factor (and expense) involved in making a realistic psychiatric specialist assessment of the applicant. In my opinion it is not a workable proposition.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Arising from concerns expressed at the Barr Tribunal, new conditions for applications were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2006. These conditions include the requirement of applicants to provide two referees to attest to their character, and also a requirement on each applicant to provide written consent for an issuing officer to make any enquiries in relation to the applicant&rsquo;s medical history from a health professional.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Guidelines, as to the practical application and operation of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2009, point out that this is a very sensitive issue and it is not possible to advise on every potential scenario which may arise in a decision making process. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines state that:  </p>  <p>  - Issuing persons should be alert to cases in which a general practitioner's report reveals that an applicant has exhibited, or is exhibiting, signs of depression, suicidal tendencies, longstanding or intermittent periods of either emotional instability or unpredictable behaviour. </p>  <p>  - Issuing persons should also be alert to any of these signs exhibited by existing certificate holders.  </p>  <p>  - It should be remembered that because a person has received treatment in the past for certain illnesses or conditions, such as depression or stress, it does not automatically follow they are unfit to possess a firearm. It is simply one of the factors to be considered with all other evidence relating to the applicant's character and history. In such cases, account should be taken of the latest medical opinion.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 3E of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended, the Garda Commissioner conducts an annual review of the operation of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2009.

This study will be carried out with a particular remit to establish if there is a need for any special protocols, legislative or other necessary changes for cases of this nature. It is also the intention to consider the experience of domestic homicide reviews in other jurisdictions in the study with a view to making recommendations in relation to their application in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

The budgetary allocation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019 amounts to &euro;1.76 billion.  Significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the Garda Fleet, ICT infrastructure and the estate.  This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation of Garda resources, in light of his identified operational demands.  Decisions in relation to the effective and efficient use of resources, including purchase and allocation of mountain bikes, are for the Commissioner.  I understand that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that 11 new mountain bikes were allocated to various Garda Districts in 2018 and a further 9 mountain bikes will be allocated to various Garda Districts in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have informed me that there are sufficient funds available within the 2019 Garda budget to purchase any additional mountain bikes should there be an operational requirement to do so.</p></reply>

Under this architecture the Commission represents Ireland and other Member States taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  As such, the EU is leading on all aspects of trade relating to Brexit.</p><p>Regarding Ireland and the EU's trading relationship with the United Kingdom once the UK has exited the EU, I am acutely aware that a no-deal scenario would have significant impacts for our economy, and certain sectors in particular.  This is why the EU - with the full support of our Government - has agreed a Withdrawal Agreement with the UK Government with a view to negotiating a Future Trading Relationship with the UK once it has exited the Union.  Such arrangements offer the best prospects of mitigating the negative consequences of the UK's exit from the EU for the UK itself, for the EU and for Ireland.</p><p>Nonetheless, in February 2018, my Department published research modelling the economic impacts of different Brexit outcomes.  It showed that, relative to a status quo baseline - that is, on a no policy change basis - in 2030 Ireland&rsquo;s GDP growth would be some 2.8% lower under an EEA type agreement, 4.3% lower under a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement and 7% lower on WTO terms than would otherwise be the case.  That is, our growth rates over the period would be reduced by the impacts of Brexit, assuming no other actions were taken to address and mitigate the Brexit impacts.</p><p>Given that exposure, the Government has consistently prioritised the need to avoid a no-deal scenario and maintain as close a trading relationship with the UK as possible post-Brexit.</p><p>As the Deputy will be fully aware, and as noted already, the EU and UK negotiators agreed in December 2018 the Withdrawal Agreement.  This Agreement was the product of two years of negotiation taking into account the UK&rsquo;s &lsquo;red lines&rsquo; and the EU&rsquo;s requirement to protect and support the single market and the Good Friday Agreement.  The Deputy will also be aware that on 21 March, the European Council agreed with the United Kingdom to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons during this next week.  If the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons, the European Council has agreed to an extension until 12 April 2019 and expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the Council.  The Government is hopeful of a favourable outcome in this regard and has noted that it is unfortunate that the UK Parliament have been, to date, unable to pass the Withdrawal Agreement.</p><p>As An T&aacute;naiste and An Taoiseach have both said recently, Brexit is a lose, lose, lose scenario - i.e. the UK, the EU and Ireland all lose out.  Nonetheless, were the UK&rsquo;s intentions for the future partnership to evolve further, the EU has made clear that the Union is prepared to further adjust the Political Declaration that sets the parameters for the Future Trading Relationship, which is designed to ameliorate as much as possible the negative impacts on trade and employment that will arise from Brexit.  All obligations and benefits of WTO rules will be considered in that context, but those considerations cannot be pre-determined at this time.</p><p>Finally, I might note that we have recently enacted the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 (the &lsquo;Omnibus Bill&rsquo;).  This piece of legislation allows the Government to amend a number of domestic laws in order to manage the negative sectoral impacts in the event the UK leaves the EU without reaching agreement on their withdrawal.  Additionally, the Government, on both a domestic and international level, are fully engaged with preparing for Brexit. Along with our EU colleagues, our focus is on ensuring that the UK passes the Withdrawal Agreement which provides the clearest and legally unambiguous platform in which to begin talks on the future relationship, whilst, at the same time, ensuring that our most vulnerable sectors are protected from the worst impacts of Brexit.  In that regard, my Department has been at the forefront of delivering, with our Enterprise Agencies, a range of measures aimed at assisting businesses navigate the economic challenges presented by Brexit with details available at <i>www.gov.ie/Brexit.</i></p></reply>

As indicated previously, this study was undertaken for internal IDA Ireland purposes and is not intended for publication due to its commercial sensitivity.</p>  <p>  It is worth reiterating that, over recent years, leading international technology and computing firms have announced several significant data centre investments for Ireland.  Our goal is to ensure that this trend continues.  In that context, IDA Ireland, supported by the relevant key stakeholders, will continue to highlight credible and flexible property solutions that form part of the competitive value proposition for this sector.</p></reply>

Particularly, as we draw closer to full employment, it is essential we continue to provide enterprise in Ireland with a high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent pool. My Department closely monitors trends in labour market participation rates. Using the latest available comparable data, the female participation rate in Ireland (56.4%) is significantly above the EU 28 average (52.1%). [1] While the female participation rate has been growing in Ireland over the last number of years, there is still untapped potential in this area.</p><p>My Department actively ensures that suitable policies are in place to support increased participation across the economy. For example, Action 28 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 called for the identification of &lsquo;relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on analysis of patterns of labour market participation&rsquo;. This action was fulfilled in H2 2018 under the guidance of an interdepartmental steering group. The analysis undertaken focused on three cohorts: females aged 25-55, people aged 55 and over, and people aged under 55 with a disability. In focussing on these cohorts, the analysis identified areas for further examination and was a key input to Future Jobs Ireland. </p><p>Future Jobs Ireland identifies increasing participation in the labour force as one of its key pillars. It acknowledges that improving participation means the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of our workforce. Future Jobs Ireland sets the target of a substantial 3 percentage point increase in overall participation rates for people aged 25 to 69 years by 2025 with higher increases for females and older people.  In order to achieve this target, the framework details relevant ambitions underpinned by deliverables. The ambitions and deliverables relevant to increasing female participation include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>- Encouraging participation in the labour force through high-quality Early Learning and Care. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables to complement the implementation of the Affordable Childcare Scheme including the introduction of additional ways to reduce costs, enhance supply and improve quality.</p><p>- Fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. This ambition assists in the development of an inclusive society. It is underpinned by a number of deliverables including the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave to allow for greater flexibility of parents.</p><p>- Improving incentives to participate in the labour force. This ambition includes a deliverable to consider income tax arrangements for second earners that optimise financial incentive to work, taking account of the impact that the income tax system may have on female participation in the workforce.</p><p>- Encouraging adult dependents and beneficiaries of other full-time welfare payments to engage in activation, enter and/or stay in the workforce. This is ambition is underpinned by deliverables such as the development of a return to work service as part of the Public Employment Service offering; assisting women returned to work in the technology sector through Skillnets Ireland Women ReBOOT programme; and a review of recent analyses of inactivity to identify policy issues to support the development of policy responses.</p><p>- Undertaking promotional campaigns to encourage greater levels of participation in the labour force. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables including a communications campaign to promote awareness of the Public Employment Service as a real recruitment option, especially for those groups with lower participation rates; and the development of promotions for female participation as part of Jobs Week 2019 and Jobs Fairs.</p><p>Eurostat Labour Force Survey, Activity rates by sex, age and citizenship (%), Females aged 15 and over; Q3 2018: available from<i> </i></p></reply>

It updated employment growth projections on the basis of the Economic and Fiscal outlook, Budget 2018 published by the Department of Finance in October 2017, and Central Bank employment projections published in their Quarterly Bulletin, QB1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  While not setting annual targets, Enterprise 2025 Renewed set the ambition to reach 2.3 million people in employment by 2020, an increase of circa 100,000 over the 2.2 million employed at Q3 2017 (CSO Labour Force Survey). The ambition is to have an unemployment rate of no more than 5.5% by 2020.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2018, which was launched together with Enterprise 2025 Renewed, targeted the creation of 50,000 jobs in 2018.  The CSO&rsquo;s Quarter 4 Labour Force Survey statistical release reported an annual increase in employment of 2.3% or 50,500 in the year to the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>  <p>  While forecasting is not an exact science and is particularly challenging for Ireland as a small open economy exposed to external drivers of change, Ireland has outperformed expectations to date with an unemployment rate in Q4 2018 of 5.4%. </p>  <p>  Based on an assessment of the Economic Impact of Exports on the Irish Economy by Indecon for my Department in 2015, it is estimated that for every 10 jobs generated by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) directly, another 8 are generated in the wider economy. On this basis, this would translate into 412,302 jobs that were supported by FDI at the end of 2018. Similarly, a record 215,207 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland backed companies in 2018 which would directly and indirectly account for over 385,500 jobs in the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019, launched on 10 March, changes the policy emphasis from numbers of jobs to the creation of more productive and sustainable jobs. It focuses on the challenges ahead in terms of ensuring we have skilled people working in quality jobs in sustainable sectors. Future Jobs Ireland will also ensure our enterprises and workers are well positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland is organised around five pillars, namely:</p>  <p>  1. Embracing Innovation and Technological Change;</p>  <p>  2. Improving SME Productivity;</p>  <p>  3. Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent;</p>  <p>  4. Increasing Participation in the Labour Force; and</p>  <p>  5. Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy</p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 sets out targets and core ambitions for each of these pillars, accompanied by a set of specific deliverables representing crucial steps toward achieving each ambition. The deliverables for 2019 represent the first stage of Future Jobs Ireland which will be built on in subsequent annual editions.</p></reply>

I recently announced that the spouses and partners of highly skilled workers coming here from outside the EEA will now have immediate access to the labour market. Effective from 26 March, I have also amended the Employment Permits Regulations to allow for the granting of General Employment Permits to certain chef grades.</p>  <p>  The work of the Personal Injuries Commission, whose Second and Final Report were published in September 2018 by my Department, the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the complementary work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group should help to reduce insurance costs for businesses. I was pleased to bring through the Oireachtas, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, which was signed into law by President Higgins on 25 February 2019. This is an important piece of legislation as it enhances the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to benefit users of the service and society more generally and it forms an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s response to facilitate cost savings. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that SMEs have access to appropriate and affordable finance and my Department supports ongoing key SME access to finance initiatives including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme. All these schemes have been developed to meet the specific needs of SMEs and to provide finance at low cost levels and better terms and conditions to SMEs than that available on the marketplace.</p>  <p>  In addition to the wide range of existing supports provided by my Department and Agencies, Budget 2019 allocated additional funding for my Department to boost business productivity, for example doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25 million. An additional &euro;2.75 million was also awarded to Enterprise Ireland for its SME Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters Programme and &euro;5m to the LEOs to support a broad range of indigenous micro-enterprises to prepare for the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit. Budget 2019 provides &euro;8 million extra for my Department&rsquo;s Brexit Response and expanding our Global Footprint. More broadly, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to Future Jobs Ireland 2019 which I launched with An Taoiseach earlier this month and which includes a dedicated pillar on improving SME productivity with a range of ambitions and deliverables for 2019. </p>  <p>  It is important also to be aware of the role that the National Competitiveness Council plays in relation to competitiveness.  The NCC is an independent advisory body that reports to the Taoiseach and the Government, through the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position.

Significant progress is being made with 58% of all IDA employment now outside of Dublin.  In 2018 there were more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.  </p>  <p>  There are 19 IDA client companies located in County Wexford employing a total of 3,139 people. These companies have exhibited steady growth in recent years, as evidenced by the 5% increase in IDA supported employment in the County from 2017 to 2018. </p>  <p>  Data on IDA-supported jobs is collated on a county-by-county basis. Information on the number of jobs in specific towns and locations is therefore unfortunately unavailable. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) client companies have also performed well in Wexford with 160 net new jobs added in 2018. This brings the total number of people employed in firms supported by EI to 4,674 across 115 client companies. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the IDA will continue to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in Wexford and the broader South-East region. In doing so, the agency will draw the attention of investors to the region's particular strengths including its ports and existing clusters of financial services, technology and high-value manufacturing firms. The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Wexford including local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. </p>  <p>  While the employment trends in Wexford are positive, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential in the county. The IDA remains pivotal to this and the agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment for Wexford.</p></reply>

The agencies under my Department have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Agency has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;22.71 billion in 2017, a growth of 7% compared to 2016&rsquo;s exporting results. The UK market accounted for 34% of total exports, an increase of 4% on 2016 exporting figures.</p>  <p> The UK is the leading exporting destination for Enterprise Ireland supported companies and is the first export destination for many companies. Despite this, Enterprise Ireland supported companies, are increasingly diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets.  </p>  <p>  While Brexit presents an economy wide challenge, a number of exporting sectors are highly exposed to Brexit. In 2017, 1,574 client companies reported exports into the UK. Of this, a group of over 640 are highly exposed to Brexit and predominately span 6 sectors (construction services, construction products, engineering, agriculture machinery, timber, furniture and food). Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with this group to ensure that sustainability and growth plans are developed in line with the agency&rsquo;s remit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. Recently launched EI supports including online Customs Training and Act On Consultancy.  In addition, the Local Enterprise Offices recently launched their customs training offering which is available to all companies.  Furthermore, the suite of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.  These range from liquidity support through short term and longer term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Scheme to deal with sudden shocks and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.</p>  <p>  It is also vital that businesses themselves prepare for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate against any adverse effects. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should in particular, examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled, particularly for clinically urgent procedures.  </p>  <p>  The HSE's annual service plan sets out the totality of Acute Hospitals' Inpatient and Day Case Activity to be delivered in the year. The HSE advise that preliminary inpatient and day case activity in 2018 was 1,699,559. The expected inpatient and day case activity to be delivered in 2019 is 1,706,875. </p>  <p>  While very effort is made to avoid cancellation or postponement of planned procedures, the HSE advise that planned procedures and operations can be postponed or cancelled for a variety of reasons including capacity issues due to increased scheduled and unscheduled care demand, medical reasons, and patient choice. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the planning approach for peak periods, such as winter, anticipates that individual hospitals do not book or schedule patients for non-urgent elective admissions and procedures so as to ensure that available capacity is focussed on the predicted increase in emergency admissions through HSE emergency departments during these periods. Usually this results in hospitals not booking, as distinct from actually cancelling, elective admissions and procedures. </p>  <p>  The HSE have further advised my Department that they do not collect detailed information centrally in relation to the reasons for cancellations and numbers per specialty.</p>  <p>  However, some local information on cancellations may be available at hospital group level and I have asked South-Southwest Hospital Group to provide the Deputy with a response based on the information available to them at each of the sites requested.</p></reply>

HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out.</p>  <p>  The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards.  In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety.</p>  <p>  HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspection of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing. In either case, an appropriate management response would be expected.</p>  <p>  HIQA wrote to hospital management following its 7th of November 2018 inspection of Cork University Hospital. HIQA received a response which outlined key actions implemented and planned by the hospital to mitigate the risks identified. In line with Section 8 of the Health Act 2007, HIQA will continue to monitor Cork University Hospital against the National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated inspection in acute health services, to include compliance with CPE guidance produced by the CPE Expert Group.</p>  <p>  In relation to the key actions implemented and planned by the hospital to mitigate the risks identified, as this is an operational issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Group met eight times from June 2013 to September 2013.  The Group set out initial proposals for consideration by Government for a statutory transport support payment scheme as a replacement for the discontinued Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Schemes.  In November 2013, the Government decided that the Minister for Health, in consultation with other relevant Ministers would progress the detailed preparatory work required for a new travel subsidy scheme and associated statutory provisions. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I brought a Memorandum to Government in May 2018 on proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

This National Clinical Guideline has been accredited by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and is available on the Department of Health website. The Guideline is an adaptation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline and the Sepsis 6 bundle, aligning these internationally recognised guidelines with the structures and functions of the Irish healthcare system.  It informs pathways of care for patients with sepsis within all Irish medical disciplines. </p>  <p>  This Guideline is currently being updated, which includes a review of the most recent international peer-reviewed evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.</p>  <p>  Alongside this National Clinical Guideline, the HSE National Sepsis Programme was established in 2014. As part of this Programme, funding has been provided for the appointment of a National Clinical Lead for sepsis in Ireland and the appointment of a number of senior nurses to coordinate the National Sepsis Programme.  The funding for these posts has been critical in driving the achievements of the National Programme and its activities in promoting sepsis diagnosis and awareness.  Since 2015, the National Sepsis Programme has continued to be funded as part of the HSE annual National Service Planning process. </p>  <p>  The National Sepsis Programme carries out important work to support the implementation of the National Sepsis Clinical Guideline, by bringing a focus on sepsis awareness and the promotion of early recognition of sepsis.  While the initial focus of the HSE National Sepsis Programme was on raising awareness among healthcare staff, initiatives to raise awareness in the community have now commenced. These activities include sepsis awareness events in the community, such as at the National Ploughing Championships, education programmes with the Garda&iacute;, and media features on national radio and TV.  Additional community information sessions have taken place in shopping centres, public lectures in universities and with community groups. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, with regard to promoting greater awareness regarding sepsis and its diagnosis, the HSE National Sepsis Programme has recently published a set of information materials on sepsis.  These are now available on the HSE website (sepsis/programme documents and resources) and include a patient information booklet, patient information leaflet and educational tools for healthcare staff.  The HSE National Sepsis Programme plans to circulate these new materials to healthcare establishments, including GP surgeries. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Sepsis Programme also publishes a sepsis report every year and organises an annual Sepsis Summit, which brings together healthcare providers, patients and carers.  A series of videos of patient experiences of sepsis has been compiled for the sepsis summit, which are used to raise awareness and are available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

HIQA subsequently followed up with the provider to ensure that appropriate and satisfactory action had been taken to address the issue, and has confirmed that appropriate action was taken in all 39 cases. No further follow-up is required. 88 of the 132 concerns were followed up by HIQA inspectors on inspection, a further four were reclassified as general queries, and one concern was judged to be outside HIQA&rsquo;s remit.  </p>  <p>  HIQA does not have the legal remit to investigate individual concerns; however, all unsolicited information received about services is assessed against the regulations and the national standards.

Such a licence, if granted, enables them to legally prescribe medical cannabis for a named patient. It is important to note that the decision to prescribe such treatment is a clinical decision for the prescribing doctor.</p>  <p>  Until acceptable medical cannabis products are available for use in Ireland, patients who are the subject of a licence are obtaining their cannabis products from a pharmacy in the Netherlands. This is necessary because Netherlands government policy does not permit cannabis oil products to be commercially exported. </p>  <p>  I am aware that a UK company may provide a service which involves it collecting cannabis products from the Netherlands for persons authorised to use it under the UK medical cannabis regime.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that this UK Company may be acting as the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;nominated representative&rdquo; in the collection of their personally prescribed medical cannabis products. No similar Irish entity is known to provide this service, but it is certainly open to any patient to engage a representative on their behalf in this regard.</p>  <p>  One licence has been granted to a commercial entity for the importation of products containing medical cannabis, into Ireland.

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework. As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the establishment of a HSE Board, the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 7 Hospital Groups were established on an administrative basis in recent years to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively. These structures are not geographically aligned. While significant progress has been made by these structures, there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p>  <p>  To address these issues, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends the geographic alignment of CHOs and hospital groups to support population based health planning and delivery, the design of the new regional bodies and ultimately the introduction of a form of regional health resource allocation. To support decisions on geographic alignment, the Sl&aacute;intecare report further recommends &ldquo;further analysis and consultation &hellip;to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and the recently published 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan, I am committed to the development of a new system of health structures and governance as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The Strategy and the Action Plan set out a number of actions that will lead to the development of a new system of health structures and governance comprising a leaner national centre with responsibility for national planning, strategy and standard setting, complemented by regional integrated care organisations with responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at a regional level. </p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommendation, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018. In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations. My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring these proposals to Government shortly.  This will take account of the 2018 consultation process and other planned engagement with key stakeholders, including CHOs, Hospital Groups and academic partners.</p></reply>

Caring is a challenging role, and family carers require support to allow them to continue caring with confidence. The 2012 National Carers&rsquo; Strategy is a cross-departmental strategy that sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government Departments and agencies for carers. Each relevant Department is responsible for the implementation of their actions and the Department of Health co-ordinates a progress report on overall implementation which is produced on a periodic basis over the lifetime of the Strategy and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The Strategy contains actions to implement four national goals encompassing a recognition of the value and contribution made by family carers, a need to support carers to manage their own health and well-being, providing adequate information, training, supports and services, and the empowering of carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently engaging with other Departments with a view to developing a revised Action Plan for the further implementation of the Strategy. Meetings have been held between the Department of Health and a number of other departments and agencies to identify additional actions which can be carried out. A stakeholder consultation on the draft Department of Health/HSE health-related proposals was undertaken at the Annual Carers Forum organised by the Department of Employment and Social Protection last November. Publication of the refreshed action plan is anticipated to take place later this year.</p>  <p>  The availability of homecare and supports for cared for people also have a positive impact on the lives of family carers. Homecare is an increasingly important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals. Over 53,000 people will receive more than 18 million home support hours this year. </p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. To do this, the Government has committed to the development of a new statutory scheme for home-support services to enable people with care needs to live at home for as long as possible. The scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-support will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services. </p>  <p>  The Department is also progressing various work-streams in order to deliver on the goal of implementing the statutory scheme. On-going work includes research to inform the conceptualisation of the overarching aim, objectives, actions and outcomes of the statutory scheme and the compilation of the data required for a review of the management, operation and funding of existing services.  Further consultation will take place as the new scheme is developed. </p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for adult home-support services is a complex undertaking. While to date important steps have been taken towards the development of the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form that it will take. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home-support services. The commitment to the development of this scheme has been reaffirmed in the recently published Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019. </p>  <p>  Addressing the healthcare needs of family carers enables them to continue to provide care to their loved ones. Following the enactment of the necessary legislation, free GP care was extended to those in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit on 1st September last year. The Department of Health has also secured funding through the Dormant Accounts fund to enable the HSE to pilot a Carer's Needs Assessment in one Community Healthcare Organisation. The HSE developed this tool with significant input from the Family Carer Reference Group, which represents a national network of over 200 carer groups across Ireland. The assessment will assist in identifying the needs of carers across all care groups and will track health and well-being outcomes for carers over time.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to ensuring that family carers receive as much support as possible to allow them to continue caring for their loved ones. </p></reply>

It would be inappropriate for me to attempt to intervene in the authorisation process or to try to influence the EMA. </p>  <p>  Once an MA has been granted, any changes (e.g. new indications, updated safety information, pharmaceutical changes) require approval by the competent authority, in this case by the EMA on behalf of the European Commission, on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data. In order to further update the SmPC the MAH would need to carry out further clinical trials to support this variation. It is up to the MAH to make an application to the EMA to vary the licensed indications for this medicine.</p></reply>

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is ongoing and the Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, officials in my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, are developing a model of care for infertility and an associated public fund for AHR. This work includes developing proposals on the allocation approved by Government for a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment during 2019. </p>  <p>  The development of a model of care for infertility will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. Once the funding proposals have been submitted and approved by me, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund. </p>  <p>  While AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish Public Health Service there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility i.e. Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to provide women who participated in the national CervicalCheck screening programme and who developed invasive cervical cancer with independent clinical assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. Over 1,700 letters have been sent to women, and to the next-of-kin of women who have, sadly, died providing information in relation to consent and a consent form for participation in the review and, to date, 1,075 women have consented to be included in the review, or about 63% of those eligible. The review will provide an individual report to each woman, as well as an aggregated report for the Minister. Approximately half of the relevant slides have now transferred to the review laboratory and the cytology phase of the review is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Committee is chaired by my Department and membership includes senior officials from my Department and the HSE, clinicians and patient advocates and representatives. The Terms of Reference for the Committee are published on my Department&rsquo;s website, as are the agenda and minutes of all Committee meetings.  </p>  <p>  Since its inception, the Committee has met 17 times and has overseen significant progress in a number of key areas. There is now a well-established and stable process for the provision of supports to women and families, in accordance with the Government decision; key staff have been appointed to CervicalCheck including a Clinical Director and staff with public health and cytopathology expertise; approximately 1,075 women have consented to be included in the Independent Clinical Expert Review and the slides are currently being independently reviewed. The Review will provide much needed-clarity for the women involved, and I look forward to receiving and publishing the Royal College's report.   </p>  <p>  In September, the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally completed its Report, providing a clear picture of what happened, and improving the understanding of the screening and audit processes and their limitations. The Committee oversaw the development of an Implementation Plan for all 50 recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry. The Implementation Plan published in December provides the necessary foundation to ensure a highly effective and well managed cervical screening programme. I welcome Dr Scally's recent progress report, published on the website of my Department last Thursday, in which he affirms that the Implementation Plan is a comprehensive response to his report, that significant effort and resources are being committed to addressing the problems he identified, and that the appropriate resourcing and project management structures are in place. The continued implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations is a key priority.  </p>  <p>  A second key priority is the introduction of the HPV test as the primary screening test. In conjunction with the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys, this will represent a significant step forward in public health and it presents the opportunity to work towards the near-eradication of cervical cancer. A project team is in place in the HSE and work is ongoing to drive this complex project forward.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with this, a third key priority is to address smear testing capacity challenges such that the current backlog is eliminated and we ensure a sustainable programme into the future. The HSE is working very actively to put in place additional capacity, following extensive searches internationally.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE have been working intensively and at the highest levels to ensure these identified priorities are progressed as swiftly as possible, and continue to do so, and they are also the subject of discussion and reporting at monthly meetings of the Steering Committee. I am satisfied that the terms of reference of the Steering Committee encompass all of these matters but of course these are kept under review. I understand that the Committee is currently giving consideration to how best to support progress on these priorities and I look forward to this important work continuing. </p></reply>

One of the Actions under this Step is to &quot;Develop guidelines and support material for those working in developing the built environment for urban development and planning in relation to reducing the obesogenic environment&quot;. The OPAP recognised that changing the obesogenic environment is a critical factor underpinning the success of maintaining the population at a healthy weight. The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles. The OPAP acknowledged that food and retail outlets are more widely available now than ever before and that this becomes important as children have discretionary income and may not follow the healthy eating guidelines. It therefore declared that it is important that the health input into the local area planning process is consistent and evidence based. </p><p>This area is being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.</p><p>In line with Actions 31 of the NPAP and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity, and Action 59 of the NPAP which commits to developing a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement, a Stakeholder Forum was held on 21 November last. </p><p>The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government). Following on from this Forum, a working group made up of representatives of all three departments was convened to consider the outputs of the stakeholder forum and related recommendations, including the ones aligned with the recommendation referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>Finally, the question of legislation around planning matters for the issue raised by the Deputy is ultimately a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government,  and I understand that he has addressed the position on this in his reply to Parliamentary Question 34831/17.

NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.</p>  <p>   On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under the age of 1 year old and the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme takes account of this.  </p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  </p>  <p> There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, Men B; Men C; PCV and Hib vaccines are offered to children to protect them against meningitis.  Adolescents are also given a Men C booster vaccine in the first year of secondary school against meningitis as part of the School Immunisation Programme. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to: </p>  <p>  - Ensuring  value  for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs  for clients and the State and administrative burden for  providers; </p>  <p>  - Increasing  the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions  as possible; and </p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents  with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. </p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and it is expected that the Steering Group will be provided with a final draft very shortly. Once complete the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly through the review process.  </p></reply>

Prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8% and was higher among males than females. For this small percentage of people for whom gambling is a problem, we need measures to reduce problem gambling and its impact on individuals and their families.</p>  <p>  The survey provides a baseline of data to assist in policy formulation and future planning and action on gambling. A further survey for 2018/2019 is currently being undertaken under the auspices of the Health Research Board (HRB). This survey will also contain a specific section on gambling prevalence, with an extended range of questions.</p></reply>

I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  In the context of residents in St Joseph&rsquo;s House, Stillorgan - the Deaf Village Ireland, any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.   </p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to: </p>  <p>  - Ensuring  value  for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs  for clients and the State and administrative burden for  providers; </p>  <p>  - Increasing  the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and </p>  <p>  - Ensuring  that there is  adequate residential capacity for those residents  with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail.</p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and it is expected that the Steering Group will be provided with a final draft very shortly. Once complete the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department of Health, where its findings will then be considered.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly through the review process.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. An annual capitation payment of &euro;434.15 is payable in respect of each GMS patient over 70 years of age residing in a private nursing home approved by the HSE for periods in excess of 5 weeks. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to introduce a new contract specifically for the provision of general practitioner services to nursing homes. However, the Deputy will be aware that talks are ongoing with GP representatives in relation to the development of modernised GP contractual arrangements. The focus of the current phase of the talks is on developing a range of modernisation, reform and sustainability measures and the development of a chronic disease management programme for GMS and GP visit card patients.</p>  <p>  Any agreement must substantially benefit patients and provide value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in position to give further details while engagement between the parties is under way.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.</p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2019 were developed by the PSI in accordance with Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007, which also permits the Council to make rules as to:</p>  <p> -  What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and</p>  <p> -  What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.   </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 14 February 2019, the Council of the PSI approved the draft Rules, subject to certain amendments made on foot of the Council&rsquo;s consideration of the results of the latest public consultation.</p>  <p>  On 8 March 2019, the PSI submitted the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2019 to me for my consent, in accordance with the requirements of the Pharmacy Act 2007. These were accompanied by a lengthy submission detailing the PSI&rsquo;s rationale for the drafting of the Rules.</p>  <p>  Throughout the course of this process my Department has received correspondence from and on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants outlining their concerns with regard to the drafting of these Rules.</p>  <p>  Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, my role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent and in doing so I will give careful consideration to the Rules as submitted by the PSI and to the concerns raised by or on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants.</p></reply>

This is the bedrock upon which our eligibility system for health services, and indeed many other public services, is founded. The necessary provisions were made in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 to enable universal access for women living in the State to the services in question without charge. Women who live in Northern Ireland can access termination services in this jurisdiction but would, in effect, be doing so as private patients and would be subject to charges in this regard.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to facilitate access without charge to termination-of-pregnancy services to women from Northern Ireland raises a number of legal and policy issues and therefore requires detailed examination. My Department intends therefore to undertake an examination of these issues, in conjunction with the Attorney General and other Government colleagues as necessary.</p></reply>

Further increases in incidence are projected in the coming years. Increased incidence reflects the consequences of ultraviolet exposure  but also better detection and increased awareness of the symptoms of skin cancer.</p>  <p>  Survival rates for skin cancers are encouraging. Five year net survival for non-melanoma skin cancer is almost 100% while five year net survival for melanoma improved from 82.7% (1994-1998) to 88.7% (2010-2014).</p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with the National Cancer Control Programme to develop a National Skin Cancer Prevention Plan which will be launched in May. </p></reply>

This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 14 February 2019, the Council of the PSI approved the draft Rules, subject to certain amendments made on foot of the Council&rsquo;s consideration of the results of the latest public consultation.</p>  <p>  On 08 March 2019, the PSI submitted the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2019 to me for my consent, in accordance with the requirements of the Pharmacy Act 2007. These were accompanied by a lengthy submission detailing the PSI&rsquo;s rationale for the drafting of the Rules.</p>  <p>  Throughout the course of this process my Department has received correspondence from and on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants outlining their concerns with regard to the drafting of these Rules. </p>  <p>  Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, my role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent and in doing so I will give careful consideration to the Rules as submitted by the PSI and to the concerns raised by or on behalf of registered pharmaceutical assistants.  </p></reply>

In some instances GP practices have a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients.  If this happens, patients should contact other GP practices in their area. While I have no role in relation to such matters, I would expect clinicians to consider the importance of patients having access to a GP service close to home when deciding whether or not to accept private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices. </p>  <p>  In addition there has been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places available and in 2018 193 places were filled, an increase of around 60% over this nine year period.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  Talks between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation are continuing. Agreement on the delivery of these service improvements and contractual reforms has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. </p></reply>

The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.  As Minister for Health, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. </p>  <p>  Pembrolizumab has been granted marketing authorisation in Ireland and the EU for a number of indications and is included on the HSE reimbursement list for some of those indications. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Pembrolizumab is being assessed by the HSE, using the criteria in the 2013 Act, for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.  Those measures included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement including Pembrolizumab, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician. The establishment of such a comprehensive support package reflected the impact of the lack of disclosure of the result of clinical audit and the ensuing controversy on individual women and their families. </p>  <p>  In January 2019, after careful consideration of the situation which had arisen in respect of patients with cervical cancer who were not encompassed by the terms of the support package agreed by Government for those affected by the CervicalCheck clinical audit non-disclosure issue, it was agreed that the HSE would put in place arrangements to facilitate access to Pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients on a case-by-case basis in public hospitals when a treating clinician determined this to be in the patient&rsquo;s best interests. As Minister, I have of course no role in relation to how doctors manage the care of individual patients. All prescribing decisions are entirely a matter for the treating clinician, in line with patient safety protocols and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics.  This arrangement applies to cervical cancer patients only.  </p>  <p>  Clinical trials for various immunotherapies, including Pembrolizumab, are ongoing globally for a range of other possible indications, which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are granted and applications received.</p>  <p>  In relation to your request to exempt Pembro from 23% VAT, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I will arrange to send the Minister for Finance a copy of my response to this question. </p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.</p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published recently and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing wait times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures, including hip and knee replacements. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.</p><p>Waiting list figures for February 2019 show that considerable improvement has been witnessed in the number of patients waiting for hip and knee replacements. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the NTPF, the number of patients waiting for a hip/knee replacement has fallen from 3,400  in July 2017 to 2,800 at the end of February 2019 equating to an improvement of 17%. Those waiting over 9 months for one of these procedures has fallen from over 1,000 in July 2017 to 367 in February 2019, a reduction of 64%.

The Establishment Order also provides that a member of the Board, including the Chairperson, may at any time be removed from membership of the Board by the Minister if, in the Minister's opinion, the member has become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions, or has committed stated misbehaviour, or his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions, or the Minister is satisfied that the member has failed to comply with the provisions in the Order which relate to disclosure of interests. </p></reply>

It specifies the conditions and minimum requirements for authorisation. It states that to estimate the performance of the automated grading method, the results of the automated grading method shall, for each validated carcass, be compared to the median of the results of the jury. The resulting accuracy of the grading by automated grading methods is established by using a system of points.  </p>  <p>  With a view to authorisation, the automated grading methods should achieve at least 60 % of the maximum number of points for both conformation and fat cover. There is no mention of 88% accuracy in the legislation.</p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcase classification, carcase presentation and weighing.  In 2016, my Department conducted approximately 600 unannounced, on-the-spot inspections in 32 factories on classification.  In 2015, there were approximately 550 inspections conducted. In 2018, my Department conducted almost 550 unannounced, on-the-spot inspections. The controls applied in Ireland are significantly in excess of those required under EU Law.  </p>  <p>  To look at mechanical versus manual, in 2018 there were 412 inspections conducted in the 23 Mechanical plants and 136 conducted in the 9 manual plants. This is an average of 17 inspections per factory per year across all inspections, which significantly exceeds the legal minimum requirement of 8 inspections per year.</p>  <p>  There were 11 instances in 2016 and 5 instances in 2015 when factories were instructed to revert to manual classification when a machine was found to be working outside of tolerance by my inspectors. To date in 2019, 1 machine has been placed in test mode.  Machines operating outside of tolerance are required to be serviced, and the calibration is checked by staff from my Department before mechanical grading recommences.</p>  <p>  The EU legislation specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcase classification. According to this legislation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week at least twice every three months. The legislation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random. </p>  <p>  In the UK and in Northern Ireland, it is individual factories, not the competent authority, who conduct performance checks on the mechanical classification machines on a daily basis.  </p>  <p>  Regarding new technologies, my Department is supervising an industry-led trial which is examining the latest technology in terms of cameras and lights for use in the mechanical classification system. The trial is examining the effectiveness of using digital cameras and LED lights as part of the carcase classification system. This trial is at an advanced stage and I intend to publish a report of the trial from an independent expert supervising the trial in due course.</p>  <p>  Subject to confirmation of effectiveness, the Department would expect the industry move to implement this technology in due course though this is a commercial decision.  The Department is satisfied that the existing system is compliant with the relevant EU Regulations. </p></reply>

For each validated carcass, the median of the results of the members of the jury shall be considered as the correct grade of that carcass. To estimate the performance of the automated grading method, the results of the automated grading method shall, for each validated carcass, be compared to the median of the results of the jury.  The resulting accuracy of the grading by automated grading methods is established by using a system of points.  </p>  <p>  According to the legislation, the automated grading methods should achieve at least 60% accuracy for both conformation and fat cover.  However, results in Ireland for classification were at much higher levels, for example, in 2018 with 91.8% accuracy for conformation and 84.8% for fat. </p>  <p>  The legislation states that carcasses shall be classified by assessment of Conformation and Fat cover and that Member States are authorised to subdivide each of the classes into a maximum of three subclasses. </p>  <p>  Regarding the testing of new technologies, my Department is supervising an industry-led trial which is examining the latest technology in terms of cameras and lights for use in the mechanical classification system. This trial  is at an advanced stage and I intend to publish a report of the trial from an independent expert supervising the trial in due course.  Subject to confirmation of effectiveness, my Department would expect the industry to move to implement this technology in due course though this is a commercial decision.  My Department is satisfied that the existing system is compliant with the relevant EU Regulations.</p>  <p>  Controls carried out by my staff are set in legislation. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1184 of 20 April 2017 governs the monitoring of carcase classification, carcase presentation and weighing.  It specifies how on-the-spot checks shall be carried out in all slaughterhouses applying compulsory carcase classification. </p>  <p>  According to this legislation, on-the-spot checks shall be performed in all slaughterhouses which slaughter 150 or more bovine animals per week at least twice every three months. The legislation stipulates that each on-the-spot check shall relate to at least 40 carcasses selected at random.</p>  <p>  Authorised classification officers conduct a classification exercise on a minimum of 100 carcasses at each inspection to determine that the performance of a classification machine is within tolerance. The unannounced checks verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. </p>  <p>  Under the current system of monitoring the performance of the machine, officials check the overall performance of the carcass grading machine. The checks carried out by officials are system checks with officials looking for systematic errors rather than at individual cases. </p></reply>

Should demand exceed these levels, this can be reviewed. </p><p>The Scheme features a two-stage application process whereby initial application is made through the SBCI website. Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number which can then be used in an application to one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.  Standard documentation including a loan application form will be required. A business plan will not be required for loans up to &euro;250,000.</p><p>Further information including a FAQ document may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website via the following link: .</p><p>SBCI held an open call earlier this year inviting banks and other lenders to become lending partners.

The Common Fisheries Policy (Article 5 of Regulation 1380/2013) provides for the continuation of such neighbourhood arrangements.  </p>  <p>  On 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen in which it found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law. It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. </p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website. While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland vessels to fish under the terms of the Voisinage arrangements, this access will be subject to the same conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats. The Bill is currently being debated in the Seanad. Access continues to be provided for Irish sea-fishing boats to the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, although the UK has expressed concerns about the unequal situation which currently prevails.  </p>  <p>  I have regular and intensive engagement with the fishing industry including the inshore fisheries sector where these issues have been discussed. Most recently, I had positive engagement with the representatives from the fisheries producer organisations and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum over the course of a detailed and considered consultation session on Thursday last, 21 March at the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty.  </p>  <p>  I now intend to proceed with completing the passage of this legislation as a matter of urgency.  This will include an amendment which will ensure that there is no question of preferential treatment for Northern Irish vessels while fishing in the 0-6 nautical mile zone.  Access will only be granted on the same terms as are applicable to Irish vessels. During the course of the forthcoming debate I also intend to speak to many of the key issues articulated by the industry including concerns regarding the limiting of access to Northern Irish vessels only, and the assurances received from the UK Government in terms of the legal reciprocity of the arrangement.</p></reply>

The Bill ensures that the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously laid down in primary legislation.  In broad terms the Bill seeks to address deficiencies in the existing legislation and the governance of Bord na gCon.  It will strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. </p>  <p>  Bord na gCon is the State Body responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in Ireland.  It is opposed to exports of greyhounds to countries that do not meet Ireland&rsquo;s welfare standards which is a view that I fully endorse.</p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. </p>  <p>  A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by my Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged. The Department also appointed a firm of Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project.   A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this classification means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.</p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is on-going in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. The  Department&rsquo;s view is that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken. It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors.</p>  <p>  The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, the consultants will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19th of December 2018.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2019 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, I have allocated &euro;100,000 for the continuation of the preparatory works for a dredging project in Howth as set out above. As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centers, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging works project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

I established an Inter Agency Fodder Group under the direction of Teagasc and comprising representatives of the various stakeholders to address issues around fodder conservation and best practice etc. In addition I introduced a number of targeted measures including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure.</p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure sought to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operated through the Co-operatives/registered importers and covered additional forage imported into the country. I am advised that there remains significant reserves of imported fodder in storage at present through these co-ops. </p>  <p>  I have also asked Teagasc to monitor the situation carefully in 2019. The most recent national fodder survey conducted by Teagasc on my behalf, in January, indicates that the fodder deficit has receded further. The most recent statistics show that 73% of farmers have sufficient fodder to meet their livestock&rsquo;s requirements. Additionally the survey shows a steady decrease in the percentage of farms reporting deficits of over 10% since the last survey in October of last year (22% in October versus 15% in January).</p>  <p>  Whilst we did see a return to normal growing conditions in the autumn/early winter and provided farmers with an excellent opportunity to replenish fodder stocks, coupled with what has been a mild winter, it is important to stress that there still remains a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I, together with my officials, will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation.  </p></reply>

I can confirm that the vast majority of dogs that are moved from Ireland go to the UK, </p>  <p>  The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 obliges Bord na gCon to publish a code of practice for the welfare of greyhounds. The primary objective of the code is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds. Currently the code gives guidance on a range of areas including general welfare principles, animal husbandry, animal health and use of animal remedies. The Board proposes to expand the existing code to include provisions with regard to best practice when exporting greyhounds.  This will include information and guidance on preparation for export, transportation arrangements and advising the exporter on the need to research the proposed export destination to establish the prevailing animal welfare code and legislation.  Bord na gCon encourages and promotes the export of greyhounds only to countries that have established a positive animal welfare code and practices which is a view that I fully endorse. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.2589.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600103#WRVV03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1002, 1009 and 1016 together.</p>  <p>  Food products placed on the marketplace are covered by a range of legislation designed to ensure that products supplied to consumers are of the highest safety standards.  My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with other Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.  </p>  <p>   Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients.  Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020 it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole.  </p>  <p>   Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>   My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>   Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>   The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>   I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p>  <p>   The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

Other EU markets now account for almost 10% of Irish exports, with France leading the way followed closely by Finland and the Netherlands. Exports to third country markets now amounts to around 10% of export totals, with South Africa showing the biggest growth for Irish exporters: this market grew by 14% in 2018 to just under &euro;30 million. </p>  <p>  Irish production again hit record levels in 2018, with 98.6 million birds slaughtered in export-approved plants, an increase of 3.3% compared to 2017, with most of the increase evident in broiler and duck production. Overall, Irish poultry production is expected to exceed the 100 million mark in 2019.</p>  <p>  While the outlook for the poultry sector is positive, the sector continues to face challenges particularly the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. In this context, the pursuit and development of new markets is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agrifood sector, as evidenced by the market development theme of Food Wise 2025. My Department is currently actively pursuing market access for poultry in a number of third country markets, including South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia. </p>  <p>  Avian influenza remains a threat. Following recent outbreaks in Europe, my Department continues to monitor the situation closely and engage with flock owners, with a view to remaining vigilant and implementing the necessary biosecurity measures required to safeguard Irish flocks.</p>  <p>  The Rural Development programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 (RDP) is also providing key supports for the enhancement and the competitiveness of the poultry sector. The main areas for support in the RDP for the poultry sector include support for on-farm capital investment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II) scheme and knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions. </p></reply>

The highlight in this respect was the decision of the Chinese authorities to open their market to Irish beef imports by listing a number of approved Irish beef establishments. Other notable achievements were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets. </p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada, Japan and Mexico, my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish agrifood products.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this regard. I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia in 2018.  These missions included participants from across the agrifood sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions. </p>  <p>  March 2019 has already seen the first trade mission of the year, this time to Turkey, primarily focusing on Live Trade. The remainder of 2019 will see missions to China in May, Japan and South Korea in June, and Algeria and Egypt in November. These destinations are in keeping with Bord Bia's recent market prioritisation exercise, which identified priorities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agrifood exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agrifood sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p></reply>

In 1996 there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. </p><p>Today there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.</p><p>Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period. </p><p>Currently, my Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.</p><p>Below as requested, I have listed from 2010-2018 the annual farmed deer slaughter volumes:-<table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>VOLUME OF DEER SLAUGHTERED</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,331</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,115</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>681 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>843</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>901</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>681</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>764</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>271 </td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>185</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These statistics are reported on by the CSO in various publications and are available on their website. My Department's publications, such as the Annual Review and Outlook 2018, also report on the costs of farm inputs. Farm output, input costs and margins also receive detailed examination each year by Teagasc in their Annual Review and Outlook. International sources used to monitor farm inputs include, Eurostat, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and OECD.</p>  <p>  In March 2019 the CSO released its Preliminary Estimate of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture for 2018. Expenditure on intermediate inputs was up 9.7% in 2018, to &euro;5,759.8 million. The main items giving rise to this increase are feedstuff and fertilisers, which increased by 26.8% and 13.5% respectively. An increase of 26.8% in feedstuffs was partly due to a 19.8% increase in volume. Energy and Lubricants expenditure also was up 8.8%.</p>  <p>  Each month the CSO issue the Agricultural Price Indices outlining the changes in output and input indices for a range of agricultural products. In their most recent release issued in mid-March, covering the period up to January 2019, the CSO indicated that the agricultural output price index decreased by 0.9% in January 2019 compared with December 2018. The agricultural input price index was up 0.1% over the same period. Thus, the resulting terms of trade index decreased by 0.9% in January 2019. </p>  <p>  On an annual basis, the agricultural input price index increased by 5.7% in January 2019 compared with January 2018. The agricultural output price index was down 3.6% in January 2019, resulting in the terms of trade index decreasing by 8.8%.</p></reply>

Meat exports (beef, pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat) increased in value by &euro;1.6 billion, or 76%, between 2009 and 2017, according to CSO trade statistics.  This growth is driven by the strong reputation Irish product has in meeting the highest standards of food safety, animal welfare, quality and nutrition, produced in a sustainable manner. Developing new and existing markets, a key theme of the Food Wise strategy, is supported by my Department&rsquo;s international market access initiatives and Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotion work.  </p>  <p>  In relation to returns for primary producers, there have been a number of development in recent years in increasing transparency to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.  For example the 'Beef Pricewatch' app launched in 2014 makes the following information available to farmers free of charge and in a very accessible manner: the average price at national and individual factory level for Steers, Heifers, Cows, and Young and Old Bulls.  In addition, discussions at EU level led to the development of the EU Market Observatory in 2016, which provides more transparency by disseminating Member State-level market data and short-term analysis in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Direct payments and other supports are also available for farmers under Pillar I of the CAP and the Rural Development Programme, as well as national schemes.  For example, I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the BEEP will provide farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit. </p></reply>

This represents a 65% decrease in the number of herds restricted in 2000, highlighting the significant success of the TB Programme.  While this historically low level of TB is very much to be welcomed, research work done in UCD tells us that without additional measures, the estimated timeline for eradication is 60 to 90 years. </p>  <p>  The actions my Department takes when TB is found include restricting the herd and removing all reactor animals. Department officials conduct an epidemiological investigation as to the specific causes of the breakdown. Each herd must have two clear tests and gamma interferon testing is also used where deemed appropriate. Forward and backward trace tests as well as contiguous testing are all tools utilised to contain and stop the spread of the disease.</p>  <p>  Regarding the risk posed by bovine TB, my Department provides advice to farmers through public meetings and online resources which are available on the bovine TB section of the Department&rsquo;s website on how to reduce the risk to their cattle. </p>  <p>  The impacts of TB on a farmer are severe, causing financial hardship and emotional stress. This is why it is so important to reduce the numbers of farmers affected and to move to eradicate this disease. For that reason, I directed my officials to establish the TB Stakeholder Forum last year, so that all stakeholders can have a voice in discussing which policy options should be chosen to reduce disease levels and eradicate bovine TB from Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Forum has been tasked with agreeing measures that can further address disease transmission with the objective of eradication by 2030 and I look forward to receiving a report from the Forum in the coming months. </p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations. </p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee, which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, believed that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.

Crops including horticulture, contribute approximately &euro;700m annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices.</p>  <p>  The cereals sector is a major contributor of high quality grain to the feed industry, provides raw material for the food and drinks industry and is a key source of seed production.  Cereals are therefore a significant stakeholder in our agrifood industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint and an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is vital.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that cereal production has experienced difficult challenges in recent times. </p>  <p>  However, my  Department continues to provide significant supports to the sector. In 2017, I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme including the tillage and horticulture sectors. As a further support, the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment for tillage farmers with over &euro;7.7 million distributed to over 700 tillage farmers to date. Early last year I announced that the EU Protein Aid Scheme was extended for 2018, resulting in over &euro;2.83m being paid to growers to date. This important Scheme will be available again in 2019 providing support to farmers who opt for growing eligible protein crops.</p>  <p>  In August 2018 I announced a &euro;2.75 million fodder production incentive measure for tillage farmers to encourage growers to participate in the fodder market. I am pleased to say that there was very positive engagement from growers with over 19,600ha of catch crops grown. Payments are on-going to tillage farmers who applied for aid under the measure.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry, in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme, providing invaluable information to growers on the latest varieties available. </p>  <p>  The agrifood sector continues to explore the development of novel markets for cereal products seeking to improve competitiveness and sustainability with Irish malting barley demand increasing with growth in demand for Irish whiskey.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to this important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agrifood industry. </p></reply>

However, as Minister, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price; cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it. Cattle prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of consumer demand, production levels and exchange rate differences. Brexit also presents enormous challenges and ongoing uncertainty for the entire beef sector.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p>  <p>  While beef farmers obviously benefit from the full range of Pillar I direct payments and Rural Development Programme schemes, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector. This scheme provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. It is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  In addition,  I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible.   Beef farmers will also be significant beneficiaries of the &euro;23m in additional funding provided to the ANC scheme this year. </p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations, which have the potential to help strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain.</p></reply>

These requirements are set out in the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Framework) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 333 of 2011). The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for ensuring compliance with these provisions, and ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions (as provided for in Section 11 of the Communications Regulations Act 2002).</p>  <p>  At a European level, I understand that the European Commission is preparing a recommendation on the security of 5G networks. Ireland will engage with fellow Member States and the EU institutions in discussing that recommendation once published, and in progressing any related actions. EU initiatives which impact across various sectors and areas of ministerial responsibility at national level will be assessed across Government, as appropriate.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.</p>  <p>  Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Co. Louth has increased by 6,885, a 10% increase. Today, the number of premises in Louth with access to high speech broadband is 51,993, or 85% of the total premises in the county. Another 381 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment.</p>  <p>  The remaining 8,660 homes, schools and businesses in Louth will be connected under the government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode. </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. I will bring a recommendation to Government in relation to the NBP in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Separately, to address mobile phone blackspots, officials in my Department and in the Department of Rural and Community Development are actively engaged with local authorities and mobile phone operators to identify priority mobile blackspots and take action to resolve this issue. </p>  <p>  To identify the areas across the country lacking adequate mobile phone coverage, both Departments have worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities now having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing. The blackspot information received so far is providing useful and usable data regarding poor coverage in many rural areas and along national and regional roads.</p>  <p>  Various other initiatives are under way to address mobile coverage blackspots:</p>  <p>  - Both Departments have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has now delivered a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie.</p></reply>

With this in mind, I am advised that in January 2017 Limerick City and County Council installed three air quality monitors to measure dust levels at three sites in the city of Limerick. These were upgraded in June 2018 by the installation of additional equipment to allow for the monitoring of gaseous pollutants. I welcome this recent initiative by Limerick City and County Council which allows for the improved provision of air quality information to local residents. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency is working with Limerick City and County Council to provide two new ambient air quality monitoring stations in Limerick city, and a local monitoring station in Abbeyfeale as part of the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme 2017 to 2022. Funding for this five year programme is provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  In relation to the levels of particulate matter, it must be recognised that it is not possible to eliminate this pollutant entirely. For PM2.5, the threshold established in European legislation (Directive 2008/50/EC) is 25 ug/m3 averaged over a calendar year, and there have been no recorded breaches of these thresholds in Ireland.</p></reply>

Within an overarching conservation ethos and focus, the National Strategy sets out three strategic objectives for angling:</p><p>- To make angling accessible and attractive through information, infrastructure and support.</p><p>- To develop tourism through the promotion of our angling resource.</p><p>- To recognise angling as a key leisure and recreation pursuit.</p><p>To date, my Department has provided &euro;2 million directly for capital projects under NSAD and a further &euro;537,000 has been provided under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development. The Salmon Conservation Fund and Midland Fisheries Fund, both sustainably funded from licence and permit income, are managed in parallel with the NSAD. For clarification, the total funding available to Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to date is &euro;3.437 million across all aspects of fisheries development, which are to be delivered under the umbrella of NSAD. </p><p>Projects with an investment of &euro;1.654 million have been completed to date, representing some 48% of the available funding. Of this, &euro;1.275 million has already been drawn down and a further &euro;400,000 is due for drawdown shortly. </p><p>Drawdown of funds under NSAD, as with other grant-aided programmes involving public funds, is subject to all governance, environmental and other project requirements. As with all publically funded grant aid, funding is made available for drawdown by project promoters after the project is delivered and when all of the governance requirements have been met, therefore the issue of &ldquo;handing back&rdquo; funding does not arise. I am advised by IFI that approximately &euro;136,000 will shortly be available for redistribution under a further round of project calls. This represents less than 4% of the available funding. </p><p>My Department has separately funded project officers for IFI to promote capacity building and a collaborative approach within the sector and to address shortfalls in expertise within voluntary organisations delivering projects. The officers engage with these groups to progress projects through governance and into delivery phase. </p><p>To date, all calls for projects under the NSAD &euro;2 million capital works element have been oversubscribed and for 2019 IFI are concentrating on delivery of existing approved projects before additional project calls can be considered. I have commended IFI on the success of its delivery of NSAD and other investment schemes so far and would point to the following milestones, which demonstrate significant progress: </p><p>- Funding has been has been allocated to 174 fisheries development and management projects nationwide;</p><p>- 48% of the NSAD projects have been completed to date;</p><p>- Angling access has been upgraded in 78 locations with a further 22 due for completion in 2019; </p><p>- Over 20 Information and Education initiatives supported, introducing approximately 1000 people to angling and informing visiting anglers. This provided equipment to the value of &euro;60,000 to angling events, signage, marketing and promotion; </p><p>- Riparian enhancement, conservation and regeneration work completed on river channels;</p><p>- Anti-poaching equipment purchased and installed;</p><p>- 10 organised angling events funded to encourage positive social inclusion in communities;</p><p>- Over 5,000 hours of engagement and communication from IFI local staff and Projects Office to provide mutual support, information, assistance and advice.</p><p>- In respect of 2019, an additional &euro;393,000 has been allocated to IFI to fund initiatives to promote increased participation in angling by young people and novice anglers</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality. For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2019 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Ireland established a nationwide network of monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.</p><p>Information from these stations is provided in map format in near real-time at www.airquality.ie The most recent real-time data from automated stations is also currently provided by the EPA at  in the form of continuously updated graphs. Historical data sets are available for download, also through the EPA website.</p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. The AAMP will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland over the period 2017 to 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. As part of this on-going enhancement of the provision of real time air quality data to the public, the EPA will also shortly be launching a new map based dashboard to provide more accessible information to the public, to be followed by a station based Air Quality Index for Health.</p></reply>

While I have not had direct engagement with either company, officials from my Department have met with representatives of these operators and have received high level presentations from both with regard to their commercial deployment plans.</p><p>The National Broadband Plan is designed to encourage investment in high speed broadband networks, so that as many premises as possible are addressed by commercial operators. To date almost 74% of the premises in Ireland are now covered by high speed broadband and this is expected to rise to 77% before the end of this year and these new investment announcements (along with other recent operator announcements) are further evidence of the willingness of industry to continue to invest and improve services to citizens across the country.</p><p>While both operators have indicated a willingness to keep the Department appraised of their rollouts as their plans develop over the coming years, they have indicated that they do not anticipate making a formal submission seeking a change to the NBP High speed broadband map. To date, neither operator has published, or provided my Department with, detailed commercial or technical plans identifying individual premises to be served.</p><p>In order for premises to be removed from the State intervention area, a commercial operator must make a submission to my Department outlining its plans and commitments to provide these premises with a high speed broadband service. This is consistent with the State aid rules applying to State interventions to ensure the availability of high speed broadband services. Any such submission must satisfy the criteria set down by my Department in the mapping process that was published in 2015 on my Department&rsquo;s website, before the NBP procurement process commenced.

The State&rsquo;s early allocation of the 3.6Ghz spectrum in 2017, (the first in Europe) and the actions to remove commercial barriers to 5G rollouts, undertaken through the Government&rsquo;s Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce are both key enablers to ensuring 5G becomes a reality in Ireland at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>The future connectivity needs of citizens will be met by a combination of solutions, not solely through 5G, but also through other complementary solutions including the National Broadband Plan (NBP), which aims to ensure high speed broadband access to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location. These different initiatives are likely to work in tandem together to provide connectivity services and solutions where they are best suited. I note recent publications from ComReg reporting on </p><p>Meeting Consumers' Connectivity Needs () through a range of solutions which highlights this point. Therefore the rollout of 5G networks in the Amber area is encouraged and does not present a barrier to the rollout of the NBP. </p><p>In relation to the rollout of a fibre based network, State Aid Guidelines provide that intervention in a market failure scenario must be technology neutral. The NBP procurement process sought market solutions based on this guidance. All pre-qualified bids received through this process did, however, propose a predominantly fibre to the home solution.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage and I intend to bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Under SI 694 and 695 of 2011, Coast Guard vehicles can be fitted with blue lights and warning devices. Arising from a safety review internally, the Coast Guard issued a clarification to its volunteers in relation to how these blue lights and warning devices (sirens) should be used on public roads. This instruction sets out the existing position as regards their use while driving on public roads.  The IRCG is committed to providing appropriate training to its volunteers and full-time staff in the correct and safe use of Blue Lights and sirens. </p>  <p>  Any legislative changes in relation to the use of blue lights and sirens would require a policy assessment which would have to take account, inter alia, of the need to balance the safety of staff, whether full-time or voluntary, members of the public as well as those to whom the Coast Guard is responding.</p></reply>

The required technical measures to link into the EU-wide system were also put in place by my Department.  It is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should they so wish, to make requests through the system for information from other Member States.</p>  <p>  I understand that to date An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not used the system, and no requests have issued to Ireland through the system for information from other Member States.  </p>  <p>  The Directive also requires Member States to report to the EU Commission on the number of outgoing requests made under the system, the types of offences involved, and the type of follow-up action taken.  As there was no request made there was nothing to report.  This raised a technical question as to whether a report specifying that there was nothing to report was required.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission took the view that, even in cases where there was nothing to report, a formal report stating that fact should be provided to them.  As Ireland had not provided such report within the required timeframe, the EU initiated infringement proceedings earlier this year.  My Department subsequently provided the Commission with the necessary report - inevitably a simple statement that there was nothing to report - and the Commission has now indicated that it will be discontinuing the infringement proceedings.   </p></reply>

However, the Regulations also provide that the vehicle licence (motor tax disc) must be surrendered to the local motor tax office not less than three months before the expiry of the licence.  They do not provide for a retrospective application for a refund.</p><p>The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road, in advance, for any number of calendar months for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Accordingly, if the owner requires that the vehicle be kept off the road for a further period following the expiry of the tax disc, he or she should make a declaration of non-use in the last month of an existing tax disc, thus avoiding a liability for motor tax.  The declaration can be made online at <i>www.motortax.ie</i>or through the local motor tax office.</p></reply>

The temporary reduction in berths available to cruise calls between 2021 and 2023 is regrettable.

Full details of the scheme and application forms are available on my Department's website at .

In the last six years there has been a 36% growth in freight at the port.</p><p>Dublin Port has confirmed that it will operate a full cruise season in 2019 and 2021 but that there will be some disruption to cruise business from 2021 to 2023 to enable construction work to take place while ensuring the port continues to handle large cargo volumes.  Cruise berths will have to be limited to around 80 cruise ships yearly for a three year period from 2021.  The port hopes to revert with increased cruise capacity after 2023 when it infrastructural works are completed and increase cruise calls back to 150 ships for the 2024/2025 season, and more thereafter.</p><p>To allow for this, Dublin Port has already secured planning permission to construct new berths for cruise ships on the North Wall Quay Extension.  A cost benefit analysis is currently underway on these additional berths (due for publication later this year) and this forms a solid basis for discussion on how this vision can be brought to fruition.</p><p>In the interim Cobh continues as a dedicated cruise berth and it will remain so post Brexit.  The Port of Cork has advised that they are working with Belfast Harbour to see if they can take some of the business that may be lost as a result of Dublin infrastructural works.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland (the National Tourism Development Authority) supports the development and promotion of various tourism sectors, including cruise tourism.</p></reply>

Over 11,500 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  <b></b></p><p>The most recent fully completed round of the programme was the 2017 round.  Under this 2017 round a record 2,320 application were submitted and &euro;62m was allocated to 1,837 individual projects.  The exact amount allocated to each project was based on a formula which combined the assessment score obtained, the amount of funding sought and the total amount of funding available for that county based on a per-capita basis.  The full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department&rsquo;s website prior to any assessments commencing.  Ministers were presented with a list of applications and a proposed monetary allocation for each valid application and no subsequent changes to these amounts were made.  Further details of the allocation process are available in the Review of the 2017 Sports Capital Programme which is published on the Department's website at:  .</p><p>Work is now underway on the assessment of applications under the 2018 round of the SCP and again the full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department's website before the detailed assessment work commenced.  </p><p>In relation to future funding of larger sports projects, the National Sports Policy was published on 25th July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years.  The fund was launched in November 2018 and is open to applications until 17<sup>th</sup>April 2019.  Full details of the new Fund are available on the Department's website.  The fund will initially focus on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities and they will be required to prioritise their projects and certify that their proposals accord with their development strategies and plans.  As with the SCP, it is envisaged that the full scoring system will be published prior to any assessment working commencing. </p><p>The SCP and the LSSIF are managed in a transparent and open manner as set out above.  While the programmes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to move responsibility for sports capital grants.</p></reply>

Any additional barriers - be they physical, regulatory or technical - to the current access arrangements between the UK and Ireland will be severely detrimental to the overall economy and must be managed as efficiently as possible. </p><p>As such, Brexit is identified as the Department&rsquo;s highest strategic risk and the response has been structured accordingly.  Preparations for Brexit have taken place based on two potential scenarios, a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario where the UK exits the European Union without a deal, and a &lsquo;Central Case Scenario&rsquo; which assumes a deal and transition period to end-2020. While planning continues under both scenarios and I am hopeful of achieving that an Agreement in line with the central case scenario can be achieved, the current focus necessarily revolves around the immediate dangers posed by a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit.</p><p>Preparations have centred on contingency measures at EU and national level, both in the transport and tourism sectors, but also across wider EU and Government structures, and with the private sector, on issues that may impact on transport and tourism.  </p><p>Details on the impacts and contingency measures can be found on the Brexit page of the Department&rsquo;s website: </p></reply>

By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. 186 of these, including an application from the organisation referred to by the Deputy,  were for projects deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and allocations to 170 projects including a grant offer to the club in question were announced in January.  </p>  <p>  This was the first time that previously invalid applicants were allowed to provide corrected documents without the need to submit a completely new application. Because these were corrected 2017 applications they were assessed using the same scoring system and assessment criteria as applied for the 2017 round. This scoring system was published on the Department's website in advance of any assessment of 2017 applications commencing. </p>  <p>  With regard to the awarding of additional marks for the level of disadvantage, the relevant mark was determined based on the Pobal Deprivation Index for the location provided by the applicant. The scoring was designed to favour applications from more disadvantaged areas and only applications from areas with a Pobal score of -5 or lower attracted additional marks under this criteria for the 2017 SCP.  The location of the organisation referred to by the Deputy has a deprivation index value of -2. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the level of disadvantage was only one of the matters considered when assessing projects with other factors such as the likelihood of increasing participation, whether facilities were being shared with other clubs and the amount of SCP funding received in the past also taken into consideration. </p></reply>

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. </p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department. </p>  <p>  I am, however, satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the port over the coming years.  The strategic plan includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets and new technology.  The port is also engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business. </p></reply>

The facilities also received RAPID funding from the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  On foot of the concerns raised, my Department engaged in a series of correspondence with the college to seek clarification in this regard and assurances that the grant aided facilities would remain in sporting use. My Department also inspected the site in June 2017 to ensure that the terms and conditions of the original grant were being adhered to. It should be noted that the concerns raised related to one particular room within the overall sports complex which was previously being used as a gymnasium. </p>  <p>  Following this inspection, the college was asked to provide a report on the usage of the overall facility and to provide evidence of how it was proposed to continue the sporting usage of the room which was the subject of the original complaint. The college provided this material in October 2017 including details of the external users of the facility, the charges being imposed and also included evidence of efforts to secure additional users for the facilities in the future. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department was satisfied that the college was then compliant with the terms and conditions of the Sports Capital Programme and the deed of covenant and charge which guarantees that the facilities will stay in sporting use for a period of 15 years from the date of the payment of the last instalment of the grant. The terms and conditions of the Sports Capital Programme do not allow the Department to dictate particular usage arrangements for a facility so long as the overall requirement to maintain the facility for sporting purposes is maintained.</p>  <p>  My Department recently contacted the College seeking a further update on the current use of the grant aided facilities. The College's response will be fully considered in the context of the terms and conditions of the original grant. </p></reply>

In a submission to my Department dated July 2016, Sport Ireland identified a range of measures for which it was seeking additional funding in the 2017 Estimates. These measures included funding to support a proposal it had received from the FAI and which Sport Ireland was interested in supporting if funding was available to allow it to do so. The proposal related to the provision of financial support for the women&rsquo;s international team for soccer with a view to strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s chances of qualifying for the finals of major tournaments. The level of funding received in Budget 2017 was not sufficient to allow Sport Ireland to fund this measure.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a copy of the funding proposal was received in my office in October 2016 and was forwarded to Sport Ireland for their attention. In its submission for the 2018 Estimates, Sport Ireland once again identified this as a funding measure which they would support if funding was available.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, the CEO of the FAI requested a meeting with the Minister of State for Tourism and Sport and me to brief us on progress within the women's game and to discuss areas where my Department could assist the organisation in its efforts to positively drive the women's game forward.  Minister Brendan Griffin and I, accompanied by an official, met with the CEO and another representative from the FAI on 12 July 2017 at which they made a presentation on developments in the women's game, including their proposal for Government support. Minister Griffin and I undertook to consider the proposal.    </p>  <p>  In October 2017, having considered the proposal and having secured a modest increase for sport in the 2018 Budget Estimates, Minister Griffin and I indicated that the Government would facilitate increased support for the women's game as part of our commitment to develop women's sport from grassroots to elite levels. In March 2018, I wrote to the CEO of Sport Ireland directing Sport Ireland to allocate funding support of &euro;195,000 to the FAI for state support of the women's national team programme. </p>  <p>  As a normal part of the Estimates process, my officials had discussions with Sport Ireland in 2017 on its submission for the 2018 Estimates, which would have included discussion of this funding proposal. My officials also had discussions and correspondence with Sport Ireland and the FAI regarding how the funding would be allocated for the women&rsquo;s teams.</p>  <p>  As the allocation of the funding to the FAI and the terms and conditions for the funding, including assurances regarding the use of the funding, are a matter for Sport Ireland, I have referred the Deputy's question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to the amount of funding that was issued to the organisation and the terms and conditions that were put in place. Please inform my office if a reply is not received within 10 days.</p></reply>

The allocations to the transport companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and, in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.  </p>  <p>  The NTA also has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and decisions on fares are set out in the NTA Fare Determinations document which is published on the NTA's website. The funding of PSO services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer, the latter which amounts to &euro;287m in 2019.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap which exists between income from fares and the cost of operating services.  </p>  <p>  In addition the National Transport Authority is responsible for the collection and publication of statistics relating to public transport such as passenger journeys.</p>  <p>  I have therefore referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA to respond directly in relation to some of the detail sought.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.2995.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600110#WRCCC04100"><p>Historically, there has been low levels of investment in Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) in Ireland. Over the past four budgets however, investment has increased by some 117% - rising from in &euro;260 million in 2015, to &euro;575 million in 2019. </p>  <p>   This increased investment has been used to address the cost of Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare to parents through a range of universal and targeted supports:</p>  <p>  - The ECCE programme provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.</p>  <p>  - The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS) Schemes provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by ELC and SAC settings. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</p>  <p>  - The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by ELC and SAC settings for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work.</p>  <p>  - Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation  centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres. </p>  <p>  Radical reforms to these schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced later this year, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy to meet the cost of ELC. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided with the level of subsidy determined by family income. NCS will also create a flexible platform for future investment in funding, allowing subsidies to be expanded over time. </p>  <p>  The OECD in its report - Faces of Joblessness - compared the ELC and SAC supports previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the NCS. For a lone parent working full time at the 25th percentile of the full-time earnings distribution, ELC costs in Ireland were the highest among all OECD countries in 2015. The Faces of Joblessness report estimated that NCS will bring net ELC costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD, or closer to the OECD average. This analysis was performed before Budget 2019 which increased the NCS thresholds at both ends and which would have enhanced the results further if included. </p>  <p>   Notwithstanding this very significant progress, investment in ELC remains unacceptably low.</p>  <p>   In their latest calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on ELC, the OECD includes DCYA investment in ELC and an estimate of the DES investment in primary school for children under 6: this is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in some other countries. Based on Ireland&rsquo;s estimated GDP for 2016 and ELC expenditure estimates, Ireland will spend 0.5% of GDP on ELC in 2016 &ndash; with every .1% of GDP increase costing &euro;300 million. If the cost of primary school for children under six is excluded, Ireland will spend just 0.2% of GDP of ELC. This investment compares poorly to other European countries where the OECD average is 0.8%. It also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1% of GDP. </p>  <p>   First 5: A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families published in November 2018 sets out an ambitious programme of work across Government Departments to improve the experiences and outcomes of children in Ireland from birth to age 5 across all aspects of their lives in the coming ten years.  One of the major objectives is that babies and young children have access to safe, high-quality, developmentally appropriate Early Learning and Care which reflects diversity of need.  Allied to that objective, First 5 identifies as a key building block additional public funding, strategically invested to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families.  Under this objective, First 5 commits to at least doubling investment in ELC by 2028.</p></reply>

My Department will shortly make a submission to the Attorney-General and once the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office has confirmed that all the requirements of the Protocol have been met, I will seek a Government decision on the ratification at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  I am also committed to implementing relevant legislation and policies, as highlighted by the Special Rapporteur. I would like to note that The Children First Act 2015, which I fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. In addition to that, the Children First National Guidance contains full details in relation to reporting a reasonable concern and making mandated reports. I would like to add that Tusla has committed to implement a strategic multi-annual work force plan to meet the short and medium term needs of the organisation and address the comments in the report regarding the shortage of social workers.</p>  <p>  Joint working between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forms an integral part of responding to the issue of sexual violence against children and achieving a joined-up approach. A number of joint working initiatives are underway to enhance co-operation and a Children First Joint Working Protocol for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na/Tusla- Child and Family Agency Liaison has been published to reflect the provisions in the Act. The Protocol covers respective responsibilities in key areas including notification of suspected abuse between both agencies, confidentiality and information sharing and liaison structures. In addition, an inter-agency data sharing agreement is currently being finalised and expected to be launched during 2019. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality has also overseen the establishment of Divisional Protective Services Units (DSPUs), which are a major commitment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme. They will deliver a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of specialised crime types, including sexual crimes, human trafficking, child abuse and domestic abuse. Ten DSPUs are currently up and running, with the remaining 19 to be established on a phased basis by the end of this year. Furthermore, the review into protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, initiated by my Ministerial colleague, is considering the issue of access to specialist training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the judiciary and legal professionals dealing with sexual offences.</p>  <p>  The report also calls for the implementation of the &lsquo;one house&rsquo; model. I would like to reiterate my commitment to the establishment of these multi-disciplinary centres that will bring together forensic, child protection, health, therapeutic and policing services in a child centred way to support children and the families of children, who have suffered sexual abuse. The first pilot centre will open in Galway in 2019 and it is expected that centres in other locations will follow. </p>  <p>  I am also taking measures to progress the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s other recommendation in relation to the comprehensive examination of certain anomalies related to historical adoptions. Following the discovery of cases of illegal birth registrations in the Saint Patrick's Guild records, I initiated a targeted review of adoption records to determine if similar evidence of illegal registration can be identified from the records of other former adoption agencies and other relevant bodies. Given the volume of potentially relevant records, a targeted review of records currently in state custody is being conducted in the first instance. The findings of this review will assist me in reaching a decision about what, if any, subsequent action might be deemed necessary to identify more fully the scale of illegal birth registrations.</p></reply>

This innovative approach facilitates and empower former residents to actively contribute to Government deliberations and action on matters of concern to them and their families.</p>  <p>  Submitting its first report within 6 months was a significant achievement for the Forum and reflects the intensive investment and commitment of participants to this new approach to dialogue. I want to acknowledge the strength and courage of each and every member of the Forum in contributing to this important work.</p>  <p>  In its report the Forum identifies priority issues for former residents and makes recommendations in the areas of health and well-being supports, identity and language, and memorialisation.  In submitting this comprehensive report, the Forum has substantially delivered on its initial Charter and mandate. </p>  <p>  When the Forum presented its draft report to me, I committed to seeking Government approval for its publication subject to the legal advices of the Attorney General.  Significant legal issues were subsequently raised in the legal advices provided to me.  These issues present a number of difficulties and I have written to Forum members to advise them of these matters directly. I intend to further update the Forum on how I propose to proceed when I have the opportunity to meet with members early next month. </p>  <p>  While solutions are being sought to the above issues I am also taking steps to advance consideration of the report&rsquo;s detailed recommendations.  My department is consulting with relevant departments and agencies to develop some initial measures in response to the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  </p>  <p>  The Chair had signalled his intention to step down once the first report was concluded. At that stage, and in the context of the submission of the first report, I signalled to the Forum that it would be opportune to give wider consideration to the future mandate and composition of the Forum.  The Forum itself also suggested a revisiting of these matters.</p>  <p>  I am currently examining how best to reflect upon the learning from process to date and I will ensure that the Forum is directly involved in this process. The approach to identify and appoint a new Chairperson will be considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  I believe that consistent engagement with former residents and other stakeholders on the matters of concern to them is essential while the Commission of Investigation continues with the important work it was established to do.  </p></reply>

When I met the Special Rapporteur in the course of her visit to Ireland in May 2018 I set out the rationale and context to the Government's approach in establishing the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters).  </p>  <p>  The Commission's terms of reference provide the necessary balance of inclusivity, specificity and focus, so as to ensure that the Commission can deliver on public expectations. In framing the terms of reference there was a deliberate emphasis on investigating the experiences of women and children who spent time in this type of institution but the terms of reference actually reflect a much wider agenda of related public concerns.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas were required to approve the draft Order and Statement of Reasons for the establishment of this Commission. </p>  <p>  The relationships of Mother and Baby Homes with other institutions, organisations and individuals involved in the entry and exit of children and mothers from these institutions will be explored by the Commission as required by Article 1(VII) and in the academic social history module as required by Article 11 of the terms of reference. The Commission will investigate evidence of patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations. </p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference require the Commission to identify the extent to which children&rsquo;s welfare and best interests were considered in making arrangements for placements, whether through &lsquo;boarding out&rsquo;, fostering or adoption, both in Ireland and abroad. They further ask the Commission to identify the extent of mothers&rsquo; participation in such decisions, including procedures around mothers&rsquo; consent, and the extent to which these procedures were sufficient to ensure that consent was full, free and informed. </p>  <p>  This allows the Commission sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing children for adoption abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means.</p>  <p>  In recognising that new information could be uncovered in the course of the investigation, the independent statutory Commission has a wide remit to examine a broad range of public concerns, to decide on their importance to the Commission's work, and to make recommendations on them as it sees fit. Under its terms of reference, the Commission is required to report on any specific matters outside its scope which it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest as part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Government is on record as stating that it will consider any recommendations made by the Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Commission will report on how Irish society responded to single women and their children at a time when they most needed our support and assistance.  It is due to deliver its final report in February 2020.</p></reply>

The social worker is responsible for the preparation and review of the child's statutory care plan which outlines the goals for the child while in care and is prepared in consultation with the child. The care plan sets out  the details needed in their placement plan for living, education, socialising, visiting family and other important issues for the child. Regulations set out the minimum visiting requirements by the social worker, to meet directly with the child and establish that they are safe, well cared for an consulted about their care. The social worker also keeps in contact with the child's parent, ensures access arrangements are  appropriate and safe  and that the parent is, in keeping with the individual circumstances of the case, is kept informed of their child's progress. </p><p>Whilst every effort is made that all children in residential care are allocated a social worker, there are a very small number of instances (currently 10) where this is not possible due to a change in social worker or where there are temporary difficulties in filling the  social work post. However, it is important to note that the allocation of social workers for children in residential care is a priority and such cases are re-prioritised for allocation as soon as possible and is a short-term issue. Social workers on the duty team will take on specific aspects of the role, for instance visiting the child or reviewing the care plan.</p></reply>

Social workers are educated and registered as generic social workers, who may then apply to take up employment in specific areas such as child protection, probation, mental health and disability services.  Accordingly, social workers are required to undertake at least two placements on a CORU accredited training course.  The placement has to be supervised by a registered experienced social worker and a student is required to undertake at least one statutory placement (Tusla or Probation Services ) and to have experience of both adult and children's services. Students have to pass their placement in order to graduate. </p><p>At the January meeting, the colleges highlighted issues with securing social work student placements. Given the importance of placements, it was agreed at the meeting that the difficulty securing placements for social work students is a significant obstacle to the provision of any additional training places on existing courses. This is also an obstacle for the development of any entirely new courses and presents a significant draw on the colleges&rsquo; resources. </p><p>Accordingly, the group decided that the first priority to be examined will be social work student placements with a view to streamlining the process of securing statutory placements. A sub-group is currently being established to examine how to streamline and formalise student placements and the colleges have indicated this will enable them to provide additional training places on existing courses. The streamlining of placements is also essential before any entirely new courses can be developed.</p></reply>

It sets out a ten-year plan to improve the lives of children up to the age of five and their families.  The actions will be delivered by a number of Government departments, State Agencies and wider partners. </p>  <p>  One of the actions in First 5 is to develop mechanisms to provide additional supports to Early Learning and Care settings where there are high proportions of children who are at risk of poverty in order to mitigate the impacts of early disadvantage.  The development of this model will be informed by the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools model, DEIS, which operates at both primary and second level. </p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan for First 5 is currently being developed in preparation for publication in May.  The plan will cover Phase I of implementation and set out annual milestones for each of the first three years of the strategy. </p>  <p>  Given the significance of the work to develop a programme for the delivery of Early Learning and Care in the context of concentrated disadvantage, and the importance of putting in place robust systems to benefit children and to ensure accountability for public money, it is essential that proper scoping, detailed analysis, piloting and evaluation takes place for this project.  Some of the first steps, which will proceed this year, will include developing a methodology for assessing levels of concentrated disadvantage in Early Learning and Care settings and analysis of the types of additional supports in Early Learning and Care that will help to address disadvantage.  It is likely to take some time before the model is refined for roll out, with funding secured.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, I can assure the Deputy that the current targeted subsidy schemes are not being dismantled. Rather, they are being streamlined in to one comprehensive scheme from October: the National Childcare Scheme (previously the Affordable Childcare Scheme). Streamlining the existing targeted subsidy schemes will make them more accessible for both parents and providers. The Scheme will provide a fair and consistent system of progressive financial support towards the cost of Early Learning and Care and School Age Care, with a particular focus on low income families but also incorporating universal supports, and provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment.</p>  <p>  Applications for the subsidy programmes currently in operation may still be made until the National Childcare Scheme goes live in October 2019, after which applications to these programmes will close. Therefore, for the 2019/2020 programme year, both the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the existing support programmes will run simultaneously. The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCS) will be merged with the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme Plus (CCSP) for the final programme year and will cease completely in 2020. To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, parents will be able to join the NCS as soon as it launches or remain in their current programme for the final programme year. If a parent wishes to change to the NCS at any point throughout the year, they can remain on their current support programme right up until their Early Learning and Care or School Age Care provider registers them for the NCS and they confirm the registration. </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will comprise two types of subsidies, universal and income-related. The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level, for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months. Income-related subsidies are payable for children between 24 weeks and 15 years, and the level of subsidy payable is determined by the family&rsquo;s reckonable income. This reckonable income represents gross income minus tax, PRSI, and other deductibles and any applicable multiple child discount.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Childcare Support Act 2018 allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care or School Age Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care or School Age Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements.  There is no general minimum or maximum age limit for a child who is the subject of a referral by a sponsor.  However, sponsor bodies will adhere to strict criteria for qualification for referral as set out in Agreements made under section 14 of the Childcare Support Act 2018.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, this means that many services that submit high quality applications ultimately do not receive an offer of funding because the budget is not there to facilitate this. </p>  <p>  As a means to address this, the 2019 Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital applicant guidelines, released on 31 January 2019, introduced a rule that clearly states that early learning and care services who have received funding under the equivalent strand of EY Capital (i.e. Creation of New EY Places) between 2016 and 2018, are not eligible to apply under Strand A (Creation of new places for 0-3 year olds) in 2019. </p>  <p>  The introduction of this rule enables the distribution of capital funding around as wide a range of services as possible over a four-year cycle.</p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness and equity, this rule must apply to all services without exception.</p>  <p>  The service in question is not eligible to apply for funding this year under Early  Years Capital 2019 - Strand A, as they received funding in the equivalent strand in 2016. This funding was made available to providers in order to facilitate an increase in childcare places from September 2016. </p>  <p>  However, there is no rule precluding this service from applying under Strands B and C in 2019. I hope they are satisfied that the two other streams of funding under the 2019 Capital schemes are still open to them.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to assisting all childcare providers, both community and private, in providing world-class childcare and meeting demand for childcare places, and I anticipate that this year's Capital programme will build on last year's good work in the sector, as well as that of previous years.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education.</p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Applications for grants or funding may fall under Levels 1, 5 or 7 of AIM.</p><p>AIM Level 1 recognises that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE programme. This includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC), established in 2016 with provision for 900 students annually for four years. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) will receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.  </p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.</p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p><p>The table shows data provided by Pobal regarding the number of grants approved under AIM Levels 1, 5 and 7 by county since AIM was launched.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>AIM Level 1 - INCO capitation</th><th></th><th>AIM Level 5 (Minor Alterations Capital Grants only)</th><th></th><th></th><th>AIM Level

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.3093.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600112#WREEE02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1188, 1189, 1191 and 1192 together.</p><p>The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), which was launched in June 2016, is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education.</p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and applications are processed through Pobal&rsquo;s Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP). Applications for support may fall under Levels 1, 4, 5 or 7 of AIM.</p><p>AIM Level 1 recognises that a strong culture of inclusion must be fostered and embedded to support all children&rsquo;s maximum participation in the ECCE programme. This includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC), established in 2016 with provision for 900 students annually for four years. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) will receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.</p><p>AIM Level 4 provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers, in cooperation with parents, are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.</p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary. </p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. To avail of this support, pre-school providers, in partnership with parents, complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile, including the Level 7 service request. </p><p>Pobal has provided the following information regarding the number of AIM applications being processed and the average waiting time for an application to be processed on PIP as at 14<sup>th</sup>March 2019:<table><tr><th>AIM Level</th><th>Number of applications in process as at 14th March 2019</th><th>Average waiting time for an application to be processed on PIP as at 14th March 2019 </th></tr><tr><td>AIM Level 1 &ndash; INCO capitation</td><td>94</td><td>16 working days</td></tr><tr><td>AIM Level 4</td><td>146</td><td>10 working days</td></tr><tr><td>AIM Level 5</td><td>22</td><td>5 working days</td></tr><tr><td>AIM Level 7</td><td>203</td><td>31 working days</td></tr></table></p><p>AIM Early Years Specialists carry out observation visits, rather than assessments, on children. They observe the child in the context of their pre-school, using the Access and Inclusion Profile. This information is then used to determine the type of support the pre-school can access under the model, to support the child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Pobal has advised that, as at 21<sup>st</sup>March 2019, 73 children were awaiting an observation visit.</p><p>The average waiting time for a child to receive an observation visit from an AIM Early Years Specialist is influenced by when the application is submitted. Pobal has advised that requests for AIM Level 7 that are made at the same time as an AIM Level 4 application have an average waiting time of 9 working days. Requests for AIM Level 7 that are made following an AIM Level 4 support visit or telephone call have an average waiting time of 17 working days. Similarly, the timing of when the application is submitted will affect the maximum waiting time for a child to receive an observation visit from an AIM Early Years Specialist. Pobal has advised that they have recorded maximum waiting times of 140 working days (concurrent AIM Level 4 and Level 7 application) and 169 working days (consecutive AIM Level 4 and Level 7 application). However it should be noted that, in both of these cases, the AIM applications were submitted in the spring before the children started in their pre-school that September. The pre-schools and parents involved in these cases were keen to be prepared in advance of the children starting in pre-school.</p></reply>

My officials have responded separately to the service provider who wrote the letter referred to in the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.  Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  My Department believes that our approach to compliance and supporting services strikes a necessary and appropriate balance.  Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.  It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9 August 2018.  Compliance with these rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings provide a valuable service to children and families across the country.  I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability.  Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.</p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges.  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance.  Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.</p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far.  I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) will replace the targeted schemes later this year.  My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the NCS was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind.  The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.  The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended.</p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate.  A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.</p>  <p>  Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.  At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575 million per year.  Community services access much of this growing investment.  Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.  This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November.</p></reply>

The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.  The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended.</p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate.  A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.</p>  <p>  Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.  At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575 million per year.  Community services access much of this growing investment.  Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.  This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November.</p></reply>

I warmly welcome this finding as I am strongly committed to high quality early learning and care and my Department is taking important steps to ensure childminders are central to the provision of early learning and care.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a Childminding Action Plan, which will contain short, medium and long term goals.  This action plan will set out steps to move incrementally towards the wider regulation, support and professional development of childminders, along with a timescale to bring them into mainstream provision.  A National Childminding Coordinator has recently been recruited who, along with six regional Childminding Development Officers to be appointed in the coming months, will spearhead implementation of the first phase of the Childminding Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In relation to Garda vetting, childminders who care for four or more pre-school children from different families or seven or more children of any age (other than their own children) fall within the scope of regulation, and must therefore register with Tusla, be Garda-vetted and meet other regulatory requirements (e.g. having first aid training).  The Childminding Action Plan will map out a pathway for bringing a much wider cohort of childminders within the scope of regulation, who will then also be required to be Garda-vetted and meet other regulatory requirements.  My Department is actively engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality on the matter of Garda vetting in the context of these plans.</p>  <p>  In relation to training for childminders, much is already available in this regard, and I intend to increase the training available through the forthcoming Childminding Action Plan.  The Childminding Action Plan will include plans to support the upskilling of childminders though both initial training and continuing professional development.</p>  <p>  More immediately, the Children First Act 2015 imposes statutory obligations on certain people to report child protection concerns at or over a defined threshold to Tusla.  My Department established the National Early Years Children First Committee in 2013, who are responsible for rolling out child protection training across the early learning and care sector.  This training has been made available to all childminders who are registered with Tusla.  A free online 'Introduction to Children First' e-learning module has also been developed by Tusla and is available for everyone to complete.  Other resources in relation to safeguarding training will become available in 2019, which childminders will be able to avail of.  In addition, through the City and County Childcare Committees my Department will shortly make available financial support for early learning and care providers to receive First Aid Response training, which will be a regulatory requirement from June 2020.  In addition to one funded place for every registered provider, I am also providing ring-fenced funding for a number of childminders to take part in the training.</p></reply>

There are currently 101 childminders registered with Tusla. As Garda-vetting is a requirement of registration, these 101 childminders have all been Garda-vetted.</p>  <p>  Childminders who are not required to register with Tusla may voluntarily notify their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) and avail of supports offered. There are currently 610 childminders voluntarily notified to their CCC.  As part of this process the childminders have agreed to an undertaking that they will engage in the Garda-vetting process.  By voluntarily notifying their CCC, childminders can access information on good practice along with training courses such as the Quality Awareness Programme, First Aid and Children First training in child protection. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a significant number of childminders who are exempt from registration with Tusla and who have chosen not to voluntarily notify their CCC. The number of these childminders who are Garda-vetted is not known.  </p>  <p>  While voluntary notification is a condition of claiming the Childcare Services Tax Relief of up to &euro;15,000, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs does not hold data on the number of childminders in receipt of this tax relief, and the Minister for Finance would be best positioned to answer this question.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently considering the report of an expert working group on childminding and in the coming months I intend to publish a Childminding Action Plan, which will include a timeline and actions for wider regulation, support and quality assurance of childminders. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-26a.3170.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032600113#WRFFF04900"><p>Assisting families to access high quality, affordable early learning and care and school age childcare is a priority for me as Minister and hence I take all questions and concerns raised by services very seriously.</p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.  Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  My Department believes that our approach to compliance and supporting services strikes a necessary and appropriate balance.  Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment.  It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9 August 2018.  Compliance with these rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible.  As funding is based on attendance, the Department cannot restore funding which was provided on the basis of registrations which did not match actual attendance. </p>  <p>   I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as the one referred to in your question, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country.  I also appreciate the impact reduced income, as a result of compliance visits, can have on their service. Hence, significant support is available to them to ensure  sustainable, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.</p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges.  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance.  Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.  </p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far.  I would recommend this service, and any other service, to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) will replace the targeted schemes later this year.  My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the NCS was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind.  The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.  The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate.  A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.</p>  <p>  Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.  At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575 million per year.  Community services access much of this growing investment.  Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.  This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November.</p></reply>

Collaborative projects and projects that benefit multiple sections of the community are particularly welcome.</p>  <p>  The project in Malin Beg is an initiative driven by local people and supported by Donegal County Council, who submitted a successful application for funding under the Digital Innovation Programme in 2018.  The project aims to use a publicly owned building as a site for a mobile phone mast, providing the residents of Malin Beg with reliable mobile phone coverage.  This is a service that local people and visitors do not currently enjoy.</p>  <p>  A mobile phone operator has committed to partner with the Local Authority to ensure that the project is completed.

My Department did not provide any funding to the mobile phone operator.</p>  <p>  A survey of the site was undertaken in February of this year which informed the detailed design of the mast, which is now in its final stages.

That said, the internal operations of CSP supported organisations, including general employment issues relating to CSP supported posts, are solely matters for the boards of those organisations to manage as the respective employers.  Accordingly, supported organisations may continue to employ persons once they reach their 66th birthday, but the funds to do so must come from a non-CSP source. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently commenced a review of the CSP.  There are no immediate plans to change programme criteria pending completion of this review.  However, the review will inform decisions on the future shape of the programme, including inter alia programme funding arrangements and age related eligibility criteria.

This increased funding level has been maintained in 2018 and 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2018 included the provision of &euro;1.2 million to upgrade the eight Volunteering Information Services to full Volunteer Centres in order to provide a consistent level of volunteering service nationwide. My Department is currently engaging with stakeholders in the roll-out of this initiative. As part of this exercise, my Department is also examining options with regard to a number of existing Volunteer Centres which are currently receiving less funding than the minimum amount recommended in the McLaughlin report.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently collating information received from a recent call for input exercise that was designed as a first step towards developing a draft national volunteering strategy. Among the topics under consideration in this context is the issue of volunteering support infrastructure and how best this can be structured to support volunteering.</p></reply>

The organisation has a CSP contract that runs to 31 December 2020 and which provides funding towards the cost of a manager and five FTEs.  That said, the organisation will be expected to engage with Pobal in 2020 as part of the normal CSP re-contracting process to determine the appropriate structure and level of support post-2020.  Any requests for additional support can be considered as part of the re-contracting process in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently commenced a review of the CSP programme.  The review will consider how the programme fits with overall Government priorities as well as with my Department&rsquo;s other community programmes and policy objectives.  It will help inform decisions on the future shape and structure of the programme and will take six months to complete.

As this is a demand led scheme, it will be kept under continuous review by myself and officials in my Department to ensure adequate funding can be made available to meet the requirements of all qualifying applicants.  There is also provision under the Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2018, which also covers 2019, for funding to meet the additional and exceptional demands of the Scheme.</p></reply>

These Acts provide for the setting of a national minimum wage (NMW) and also provide that in specified circumstances, such as younger workers and trainees, a reduced, sub-minimum rate may be applied. </p><p>In September 2015, the Low Pay Commission was requested to examine the appropriateness of the subminimum rates as provided for in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 with regard, in particular, to their impact on youth unemployment rates and participation in education. </p><p>The Commission undertook a consultation process on this subject in line with its evidence-based approach to making recommendations to Government. The consultation process was advertised nationally seeking submissions from interested parties; and the Commission sent a targeted email to a variety of interested parties seeking submissions, including the Irish Hairdressing Federation. </p><p>I understand that a number of further contacts were made with the Federation, both telephone and email, inviting the Federation to make a submission on this matter and to participate in the oral hearings to discuss the subject held by the Commission in February 2016. </p><p>The Commission received 15 submissions in total, none of which came from the hairdressing sector. The Irish Hairdressing Federation did not make a submission and did not participate in the oral hearings held by the Commission.</p><p>The Commission's final report was published in February 2018.  (The Commission&rsquo;s interim report in 2016 did not make recommendations, pending the availability of evidence as to the numbers in receipt of the sub-minima rates, which only became available in late 2017.)</p><p>Having examined all available evidence and the submissions received, and considered a range of options, the Commission recommended the abolition of training rates and the simplification of the age-based rates.  The rationale for the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations is set out in its reports, which are available at <i>www.lowpaycommission.ie.</i></p><p>The Low Pay Commission is an independent, authoritative body on matters relating to the national minimum wage and I am confident that the Commission gave consideration to the impact of any recommendations it made in regard to training rates.  </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations were accepted by Government and the amendments to make the necessary legislative changes to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 were implemented via the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.  In the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas I set out the rationale for the changes, and the proposed measures received cross-party approval and were accepted without amendment.  The changes came into effect on 4 March 2019.  </p><p>My powers under the legislation regarding the adjustment of rates depending on labour market conditions are related solely to the setting of the appropriate percentage to be applied in the case of the age-based rates.</p></reply>

This approach, which includes generous provision for homecaring periods, will benefit many such pensioners, especially those who took time out of the workplace for caring purposes.  The required primary legislative provisions are contained in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018, enacted on 24 December 2018.  All the necessary regulatory and system changes have now been made to allow the increased payments to begin. </p>  <p>  My Department is now reviewing the pension payments of approximately 91,000 pensioners who were awarded less than the maximum rate of pension since September 2012.  Given the number of pensioners involved, this work will take a number of months to complete.  The increased payments will also include arrears to the 30th March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  The Department is using information it already has to complete these reviews.  However, in quite a number of cases, additional information is required from the pensioners concerned about gap periods in their social insurance records and my Department will be in touch with each of those pensioners individually to get that information. </p>  <p>  As regards the TCA model that will apply for all new pensioners post-2020, I launched a public consultation on the design of the full scheme on 28 May to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over three months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process. </p>  <p>  I intend bringing a proposal to Government shortly, setting out the proposed details of the scheme.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  I can confirm that the model will include provision for homecaring periods. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The scheme allows a qualified person to retain a reducing proportion of their social protection payment plus secondary benefits over two years.  To qualify for this scheme a person must set up a self-employment business that has been approved by the Local Development Company or one of this Department&rsquo;s case officers covering the area in which they live<b>.  </b>The business venture must be deemed to be viable and sustainable and must not involve displacement of existing business in the same industry or service sector.  </p><p>The person concerned has enquired on a number of occasions as to whether he qualifies for the Back To Work Enterprise Allowance scheme.

In the course of the conversation he informed the officer that he has, in the intervening period, established the business and that it is &lsquo;&rsquo;up and running&rsquo;&rsquo;. This fact further rules him out of participation on the Back To Work Enterprise Allowance Scheme as participants must engage in new business only. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing.</p>  <p>  Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly.  Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks.  I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Overall coordination of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy is led by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  In addition, a significant body of legislation has been developed at national level to combat discrimination and guarantee equal treatment. In this regard, a large number of non-legislative measures and initiatives have helped to promote equality between women and men in all areas. The Minister for Justice and Equality is also responsible for the provision of the legal framework that provides for equal treatment of women and men.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015.  Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister respecting the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The national minimum hourly rate of pay under the National Minimum Wage Acts provides a pay floor for all workers, regardless of gender.  A Research Bulletin published by the ESRI in December 2018, titled 'Minimum Wages and the Gender Pay Gap' noted that a large decrease in the gender wage gap for low-paid workers was observed in Ireland after the introduction of the minimum wage in April 2000. Before the introduction of the Irish minimum wage, men&rsquo;s wages were 24% higher than women&rsquo;s wages in the bottom wage decile, i.e. among the lowest-paid tenth of workers. After the introduction of the minimum wage, this gap had reduced to 5%.</p>  <p>  The results of the ESRI study indicated that the gender wage gap for the low paid may be effectively reduced by the National Minimum Wage, provided that compliance is high, across both genders.</p>  <p>  More recently, increases in the national minimum wage recommended by the Low Pay Commission since its establishment in 2015 have resulted in a 13.3% increase in the national minimum hourly rate of pay to &euro;9.80; this increase has applied to all workers regardless of gender.</p></reply>

The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in this legislation when conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.</p>  <p>  One of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable citizens to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC.  It simply gives individuals the option to use their PSC if they wish, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 proposes a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Acts, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004 in addition to the provisions relating to PSC use.</p>  <p>  The amendments to the Pensions Act contain a number of key measures relating to Defined Benefit pension schemes.  It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.  These provisions in particular are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult in detail with other Government Departments and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of the provisions.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The nationwide network of Citizens Information Services (CIS), is funded and supported by the CIB, and provides information, advice and advocacy services to the public. CIS supports clients, including those who may have a disability, to act on their own behalf wherever possible (self-advocacy) and also advocate directly on behalf of clients, where required.</p>  <p>  CIS has an overall paid staffing of 285 employees ( equating to 193 Whole Time Equivalents (WTE's). The network is also currently supported by 201 employment scheme workers (equating to 109.5 WTE's); and 990 volunteers (equating to 112 WTE's).</p>  <p>  In 2018, the total number of representative advocacy cases dealt with by the Citizens Information Services was 2,638.  The majority of these cases related to social welfare and housing issues. Of the total, the number of cases that did not relate to social welfare or housing was 871.  These cases related to a variety of issues such as health, money and tax, employment etc. </p>  <p>  The CIB also funds and supports the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS), which provides an independent, confidential and free advocacy service that works exclusively for adults with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Current staffing in NAS stands at 54 (52.5 WTE's). The number is due to increase to 56 staff ( 53.5 WTE's )during the course of 2019. Pay scales in the organization range from &euro;24,407 (point 1 Administrator scale) up to &euro;84,877 (top point of the National Manager scale).  There is only one staff member who is paid at the equivalent to Grade VIII in the HSE.  </p>  <p>  NAS has recently been awarded the contract for the provision of a new independent Patient Safety Advocacy Service, funded by the Department of Health. This new service will support those wishing to make a complaint about their experience of the public health service; and provide support to patients who may have been affected by a patient safety incident.

As a Public Employment Service, Intreo offers the full range of Intreo services to all citizens of working age including income supports and activation services. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is conditional on a jobseeker being available for and genuinely seeking work. Jobseekers are supported in their efforts to secure employment through the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and other supports. In turn, jobseekers commit to take reasonable steps to avail of opportunities to improve their prospects of employment.</p>  <p>  The jobseekers activation process includes a range of approaches including referral to job vacancies, education and training supports and nomination to JobPath, Local Employment Services and direct employment schemes such as TUS and Community Employment. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to jobseeker payments is dependent on participation in the activation process. </p>  <p>  The majority of engagements with jobseekers take place on a one to one basis.  However, it has also been found that active marketing and promotion of opportunities and communication of wider employment and training options can play a valuable role in supporting jobseekers.  Intreo Job Week and aligned initiatives that are run throughout the year showcase these opportunities and provide the opportunity for large numbers of jobseekers and others to meet recruiting employers. At these events employers can meet, inform and interview potential applicants, while job seekers get the chance to ask questions, identify opportunities for upskilling and make important connections. Career fairs are excellent networking opportunities for people to meet those already working in their preferred industry and to identify options for education and training. </p>  <p>  Invariably, these events are always well attended, reflecting the very high levels of interest in them. The feedback for attendees at these events has been very positive; for example, of the 450 who evaluated the recent event in Tipperary Town, 90% gave positive feedback and made particular mention of the level of information and support available to Jobseekers at the event.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by Departmental staff attending those events to provide for confidentiality and privacy of persons making enquiries. The nature of these events is such that personal and confidential issues are not discussed. Where an individual has an enquiry relating to their own particular circumstances, staff will always deal with these in a sensitive manner. Where the enquiry cannot be dealt with on the day or it would be inappropriate to do so, arrangements are made to contact the customer as soon as possible thereafter. Equally employers and other third party organisations attending at these events are expected to be professional and sensitive to ensure personal privacy is respected.  </p>  <p>  Invited jobseekers who are uncomfortable with attending these events for reasons of privacy can contact their case officer in advance to discuss if the need arises. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in this legislation when conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  </p>  <p>  One of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable citizens to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC.  It simply gives individuals the option to use their PSC if they wish, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 proposes a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Acts, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004 in addition to the provisions relating to PSC use. </p>  <p>  The amendments to the Pensions Act contain a number of key measures relating to Defined Benefit pension schemes.  It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.  These provisions in particular are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult in detail with other Government Departments and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of the provisions.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In some cases additional information is being requested to ensure people receives the best rate possible.  Approximately 25,000 requests for information have issued to date.  It is important that prompt responses are received to those requests so that the reviews can be completed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Reviews commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary regulations which together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made.  The most recently available figures show that as at week ending 22 March 2019, 8,367 reviews have been completed.  </p>  <p>  It will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the number involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  Over 100 temporary staff have been recruited to help with this work.  Outcomes will issue to all pensioners in writing when their review is complete.  </p>  <p>  Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay and arrears issued backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.   </p>  <p>  Given the scale (90,000 pensioners) involved, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it would not be reasonable to expect all to be processed immediately. While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing. </p>  <p>   Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly. Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks. I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment at 18 years of age, without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from a young age.  The reduced rates for aged 18 and 19 JA recipients were first introduced in April 2009 and extended to jobseekers aged 20 to 24 from December 2009.  The reduced rates were further extended to 25 year olds in Budget 2014.</p>  <p>  A key feature of the introduction of the JA rate reductions was that subsequent participation in full-time education and training would lead to an increased rate in payment.  As a result, if a young jobseeker on a reduced JA payment participates on an education or training programme they receive the maximum weekly personal payment, currently &euro;198.  Budget 2019 increased the rate of JA weekly rates by &euro;5 which means that JA customers under 26 years of age will also benefit from an increase of &euro;5 in their personal rate of payment from 25th March 2019.</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work 2016-2020, the Department committed to review and report on the impact of the reduced rates for JA recipients aged 18 to 25.  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) undertook research which examined the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training and employment.  My Department did not commission this research but allowed the NUIM access to the data from the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Longitudinal Database to undertake this research.  The University examined data for 18 and 19 year olds as the reduced rates were first introduced for this cohort.

The minimum personal contribution of young people from 18 to 24 years receiving age-related-reduced social welfare support is &euro;10 per week, and for those who are 25 years of age, &euro;20 per week.  There are also reduced rent supplement minimum contributions expected for couple categories receiving age-related-reduced social welfare support.  For all other categories, i.e., those not receiving age-related-reduced social welfare payments, single persons are required to provide &euro;30 weekly minimum contribution towards their accommodation and &euro;40 for couple categories. </p>  <p>  Rent Supplement continues its withdrawal from the provision of long term housing within the private rented sector.

It aims to enhance employability and mobility by providing work experience and training opportunities for unemployed persons within their own communities. In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.</p>  <p>  Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like CE. Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants and, in addition, participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, many CE schemes provide vital community services across the country, all of which are well embedded in these communities.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities.  In that regard, the Government has agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements for activation and social inclusion CE placements.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, following the review of the CE scheme in 2015, a decision was taken to adopt a two strand approach for all CE placements and they were categorised as either a training/activation strand or a social inclusion strand.  It is my strong view that local services which are supported by these social inclusion placements must be safeguarded into the future.  This scheme will continue to be subject to continuous improvement and reviewed on a regular basis.</p>  <p>   The Department values the local services provided by bodies such as the Local Employment Service (LES) very highly  and will continue to depend on local service providers to supplement and complement its own direct service provision into the future.  However, it is a legal requirement that these services be procured in an open process and that appropriate governance arrangements are in place.  Accordingly my Department commissioned Indecon to complete an independent, evidence&ndash;based evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency and of the governance of the LES and Job Clubs.  The report was published in January 2019 and will help inform both the Department and the LES as to how to ensure compliance with legal procurement requirements.  My Department and I have been engaging with key stakeholders throughout this process and will, of course, continue to do so. </p></reply>

We simply could not sustain a lot of our local community services without their work and it is, of course, a concern to me that the Supervisors felt compelled to take industrial action on the 18th February 2019.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the industrial action relates to a claim by CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise the fact that CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding. They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction (PRD) under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  </p>  <p>  The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.  </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the numbers involved, which is hard to establish. This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  CE supervisors may qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) if they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions. The State Pension (Contributory) is not means-tested.  This pension has a maximum personal rate payable of &euro;12,956.  </p></reply>

All contracts in place are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and the courts of Ireland have exclusive jurisdiction over these contracts. </p>  <p>  In addition, JobPath providers are contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner as data processors and are legally bound to observe and adhere to data protection requirements. </p>  <p>  The JobPath Providers are required to offer in-work support to the customer for up to twelve months while they remain in employment. This includes scheduled contact with the person as well as ad-hoc contact should they need immediate support or advice, this may be particularly important for those in temporary or part-time employment to provide the specific support needed to progress to more sustainable permanent employment. </p>  <p>  The JobPath providers may contact employers as part of the in work support provided to JobPath customers who attain sustainable employment while with the JobPath service. In addition, contractors may, with the jobseekers consent, provide non-personal information to prospective employers or assist jobseekers in completing job application forms.</p>  <p>  Personal data is not shared by the JobPath providers with employers or shared with other third parties. Sub-contractors engaged by the JobPath service providers for the purpose of delivering the JobPath service are also fully governed by the same contractual obligation as the main contractor. </p>  <p>  A JobPath service customer is not under an obligation to provide employment or employer details to the JobPath provider but, if they wish to do so and avail of the in-employment support offered, all information will be treated confidentially. </p>  <p>  My Department has regular meetings with both JobPath providers to ensure that they are fully aware of and are fulfilling their contractual obligations, including those concerned with data protection regulations. Both companies have undertaken regular independent audits of their data processes and procedures as part of these contractual obligations, in addition, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has conducted audits of each JobPath company. Employees of both companies, and their subcontractors, are subject to the same data protection laws as Departmental staff. </p>  <p>  It is not appropriate, nor is it normal practice for Turas Nua to request that an employer provide a letter when declining a job applicant and Turas Nua have informed my Department that they are not aware of any incidence of this occurring. However, if the Deputy has details of a particular case , he should bring it to my Department's attention and my officials will investigate it further.   </p></reply>

The EU provides common rules to protect a person&rsquo;s social security rights when moving within the EU.  However, these social security coordination rules do not replace national systems with a single European one.  All EU countries are free to decide who is to be insured under their legislation, which benefits are granted and under what conditions.  While the EU rules provide that social security benefits can be exported in certain instances, these exportability rules generally do not apply to non-contributory benefits such as DA. </p>  <p>  It is only in specific and exceptional circumstances that the payment of DA may continue on an administrative basis when a person is resident outside of the State.  One of these two circumstances is where a person is in receipt of Back to Education Allowance and part of their course of study takes place abroad.  The other is where a person is receiving medical treatment abroad which is not available within the State and where that treatment is approved by the Health Services Executive (HSE).  The Department, on an administrative basis, may decide to allow payment of DA to continue while a person is outside the State where application is made in advance and the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department that they satisfy one of the two specified exceptional reasons for absence.</p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.</p>  <p>  Wherever possible reviews will be processed using information already held by my Department.  In some cases additional information is being requested to ensure people receives the best rate possible.  Approximately 25,000 requests for information have issued to date.  It is important that prompt responses are received to those requests so that the reviews can be completed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Reviews commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary regulations which together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made.  The most recently available figures show that as at week ending 22 March 2019, 8,367 reviews have been completed.  </p>  <p>  It will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the number involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  Over 100 temporary staff have been recruited to help with this work.  Outcomes will issue to all pensioners in writing when their review is complete.  </p>  <p>  Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay and arrears issued backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.   </p>  <p>  Given the scale (90,000 pensioners) involved, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it would not be reasonable to expect all to be processed immediately. While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing. </p>  <p>   Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly. Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks. I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Furthermore, under National Policy Objective 18b, my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies, such as Irish Water, and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.  </p><p>The development of such a programme must take account of lessons learned from experience with so called &ldquo;Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure&rdquo; (DPI), which my Department&rsquo;s National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI) examined and reported on.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf</i>.</p><p>I understand that Irish Water will be bringing forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the NPF. The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s Investment Plan. </p><p>Irish Water is to work with Local Authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies.  I understand that it is proposed that the overall national budget for this Programme by Irish Water would be allocated between counties, based on an identified need against set criteria. </p><p>Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.  These submissions are currently being considered by the CRU and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.  </p><p>The broad approach outlined in the document &ldquo;Water Services Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rdquo; which I published last year in draft format under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), is that there is effective coordination between planning authorities in their planning functions, Irish Water in its rolling capital investment programmes and local community interests.  </p><p>The draft Guidelines highlight that it is the policy of Irish Water to facilitate connections to existing infrastructure, where capacity exists, in order to maximise the use of existing infrastructure and reduce additional investment costs; and that there is a general presumption that development will be focused into areas that are serviced by public water supply and wastewater collection networks with the exception of domestic systems for single dwellings.  I propose to issue final Guidelines shortly. </p></reply>

In addition, the circumstances relating to any particular development proposal can change over time, such as changes to national policy or the development plan for the functional area of the relevant planning authority which may impact on the policy approach to be adopted in relation to the determination of decisions on specific forms of development in the functional area concerned.</p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, any person may make a submission or observations in respect of an individual planning application, including an application for a strategic infrastructure development (SID) proposal. When making its decision in respect of a SID planning application , or in respect of subsequent applications made in relation to the same site, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required, in each case, to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned; all submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees; as well as the county or city development plan - or local area plan where one exists - for the area concerned. </p>  <p>  I consider that the current arrangements provide for the right of all parties to participate in the planning process in respect of individual development proposals in an open and transparent manner and for their views to be appropriately taken into account at all stages of the process. Accordingly as indicated, I do not propose to change the current arrangements in this regard.</p></reply>

The annual rate on valuation (ARV), to be applied to the valuation of each property, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and is a reserved function.  </p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State. To date, revaluations have been fully completed in respect of 16 of 31 local authority areas. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.  The process provides for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area  to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.</p>  <p>  I understand that prior to the enactment of the Valuation Act 2001, if a property had both a commercial and domestic element, it was common practice by the Commissioner of Valuation to value it as a whole and to include a "domestic allowance" to reduce valuation in respect of the domestic area of the property.  As valuation lists in local authorities are revalued, as part of the national revaluation programme, only commercial elements of properties are valued and therefore domestic allowances become obsolete.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature.  This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes information on the sale of local authority houses each year. This can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/statistics/social-and-affordble/other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics.</p>  <p>  Sales of houses between the years 2000-2015 were made under the terms of the 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme or the 2011 Fixed term Tenant Purchase Scheme for long-standing tenants. </p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 set the commencement date as 1 January 2016 for the introduction of the current incremental tenant purchase model. All sales from 1 January 2016 have been made under the terms of this Scheme.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review shortly. </p></reply>

The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M.</p>  <p>  Part B (Fire safety) of the Regulations sets down the statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision which must be achieved when a new building, including a dwelling, is designed and constructed or when an existing building is subject to works involving an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.  Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) contains guidance, compliance with which will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. However, as with all Parts, the adoption of an approach other than that outlined in the guidance is not precluded provided that the relevant requirements of the regulations (e.g. Part B) are complied with. Part B is set out in broad performance terms.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the review of Part B/TDG B Fire Safety. It has been decided in the interest of clarity to separate the guidance into two volumes.  A new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 was published in 2017 and came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwellings only.  Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, is currently being prepared for public consultation shortly.  This guidance document will provide greater clarity on the conditions required to demonstrate compliance with Building Regulations taking into account the changes in standards since the last review.</p>  <p>  Part III of the Building Control Regulations require a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) to be obtained for new buildings (with some exceptions) and certain works to existing buildings. The FSC ensures the building/works if constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations. As such, an application is examined technically, by the Chief Fire Officer /Building Control Authority, for compliance with Part B, either on the basis of TGD B or through alternative approaches to providing fire safety.  Dublin Fire Brigade assesses and processes Fire Safety Certificate applications for Dublin City Council and on behalf of Fingal County Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council.</p>  <p>  A right of appeal is also provided for in this Part of the Building Control Regulations, in instances where a building control authority grant a fire safety certificate with conditions, or refuse to grant a fire safety certificate.  The applicant may appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la against the decision of the building control authority. The Board is fully independent in the performance of these statutory functions.</p>  <p>  In the three year period referred to in the newspaper article concerned, there were in the order of 1,800 fire safety certificates refused/granted, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la made 38 formal decisions.  Of these decisions, 29 resulted in amendments to Dublin City Council's conditions, one resulted in the reversal of the refusal by DCC to grant a certificate and 8 appeals were refused by the Board.</p>  <p>  Each decision is preceded by an inspector&rsquo;s report commissioned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la which contains an assessment of the issues raised and a recommendation in relation to the appeal. The inspector&rsquo;s report in each case is made available for inspection post decision on the Board&rsquo;s website or in its offices.</p></reply>

Promoting the efficient and sustainable use of water is central to my Department&rsquo;s water policy. The Government's Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, as published in May last year, sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing that will be pursued between now and 2025.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2017 and, in line with the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks. The National Leakage Reduction Programme in particular includes investment of some &euro;250 million over the next four years under the Find and Fix repair scheme and the Water Mains Rehabilitation programme.</p>  <p>  Legislative provision to discourage the excessive use of water services was included in the Water Services Act 2017. Excessive usage is determined by reference to the threshold amount of 213,000 litres per household per annum as specified by ministerial order with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with provisions contained in sections 8 and 9 of the Water Services Act 2017.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is responsible for developing and implementing the necessary administrative arrangements, including billing arrangements, subject to oversight and approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The amount to be charged will be determined by the CRU and the process that is to lead to a decision in this regard has now commenced.</p>  <p>  Once administrative arrangements and charges have been approved by the CRU, Irish Water will be in a position later this year to notify relevant customers who, having regard to their consumption patterns during 2018, appear to be consuming water services excessively and therefore potentially liable for excessive usage charges.  Only customers who continue to consume water services excessively during the six month period following receipt of a formal notice in this way, will become liable for charges to cover excessive usage during the six month notice period and any subsequent periods.</p>  <p>  The overall aim is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue.  On this basis, I understand that Irish Water will work proactively with relevant customers to identify whatever practical steps may be necessary in order to address their situation and bring their consumption back within the threshold level.  Additional allowance amounts for water usage will be available to larger households (where the number of residents exceeds four) and exemptions will be available in cases of medical need.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee recommended a proactive approach to promoting awareness of water conservation, and Irish Water places a strong emphasis on this important area. A dedicated section on the Irish Water website provides information in relation to water conservation at www.water.ie/bewatersmart. The content includes suggested lifestyle changes to save water and information on how to check for water leaks in the home.  Information is also available on water saving devices outside of the home, including rainwater butts and rainwater reuse for the farming sector.</p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s website also has a facility where members of the public can report leaks in public areas. Based on the information provided, Irish Water will follow up to confirm a leak on the public mains and complete a repair.</p>  <p>  Irish Water supports a number of environmental education campaigns which raise awareness, promote understanding and encourage people to take action on water conservation issues. This includes the Green Schools Programme, which has delivered savings of 360 million litres of water in schools in one year alone. Irish Water has also engaged with primary and secondary schools as part of Engineers Ireland&rsquo;s Engineers Week, to increase knowledge and awareness of water conservation and its benefits to the environment.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has undertaken a research study to provide an in-depth understanding of household water usage. The insights will help guide the roll out of product and behavioural interventions to improve water conservation in Ireland. Key findings show that, in general, people agree with the need to value and conserve water. These research findings are providing recommendations for behavioural change and water saving devices inside the home.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Policy Statement is expected to influence all stakeholders, including An F&oacute;ram Uisce, which has a specific advisory role in relation to water conservation under the Water Services Act 2017.  Having regard to its statutory role, the Policy Statement provides that An F&oacute;ram Uisce will also consider the recommendations in respect of water conservation included in the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, with a view to identifying practical steps for their implementation.</p></reply>

Irish Water is the lead authority in relation to the management and conservation of public water supplies.</p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the EPA in relation to its role in respect of water and wastewater services, including with regard to the resource implications arising from its responsibilities. Under its Water Quality Programme, my Department funds the EPA to conduct a range of activities to facilitate and support the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, including the water quality monitoring of rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwater.</p>  <p>  In relation to policy on water conservation, the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, which I published in May 2018, sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The EPA was involved as a key stakeholder in the process leading to preparation of the Policy Statement, which is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025_0.pdf.</p>  <p>  The Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water.

The Water Services Policy Statement is consistent with this position.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Policy Statement is expected to influence all stakeholders, including An F&oacute;ram Uisce which has a statutory role in relation to water conservation and the EPA in respect of developing research proposals.

In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. When a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. In multi-unit developments, the "person having control" is generally the owner management company. Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.</p>  <p>  While it is not intended to establish a new Building Standards and Consumer Protection Agency, stronger compliance with building standards has been a key priority for Government in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade.  The Building Control Reform agenda was initiated in 2011, when a high level working group reviewed the existing building control regulatory framework. The key deficits identified in the regulatory regime were the lack of involvement of construction professionals on site and lack of accountability in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  In response, a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda has been developed:</p>  <p>1. Reform of the Building Control process;</p>  <p>2. Establishment of a National Building Control Management Project; and</p>  <p>3. Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing.</p>  <p>  These reforms, while some are still in progress, have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations. </p></reply>

This land map can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland website at . The map includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites amounting to some 1,700 hectares, and local authorities have been requested to update the map on a quarterly basis.</p><p>In terms of funding, approximately &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for housing in 2019. All local authorities are encouraged to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals, which can be funded through the range of schemes and programmes that have been put in place.</p><p>While the development of existing local authority sites is the priority, in instances where a local authority has identified a need to acquire additional lands, it may seek to borrow the required finance from the Housing Finance Agency.  Once the site is included within the social housing construction programme, my Department would normally consider recouping the land costs and any associated loan interest charges to the local authority, as part of the social housing project approval process.</p><p>In accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, a decision to borrow is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned who are accountable for all expenditure by the local authority. As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.</p><p>Section 106 of the said Act also provides that local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to undertake borrowing. In this regard, a request to borrow for housing land acquisition can be submitted by the local authority to my Department.  Sanction may be granted based on an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules. My Department will continue to work in a co-operative manner with local authorities regarding such applications.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.</p>  <p>  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Lease Scheme. All homes delivered under leasing arrangements will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).</p>  <p>  It is intended that just over 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2019 through a combination of longterm leasing arrangements, including the Enhanced Leasing Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. The Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the standard long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure.</p>  <p>  The scheme is governed by my Department and operated by local authorities. The Housing Agency manages and administers the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator.</p>  <p>  Two Calls for Proposals were run for interested parties during 2018; the first from January to April and the second from August to October. A significant number of potential properties were submitted for consideration by interested parties, in over 40 no. full submissions. A large number of these submissions did not meet the minimum requirements of the scheme, which included having appropriate planning permission in place and suitability for social housing. 3 proposals are currently at an advanced stage of the financial and associated diligence process, and are moving towards Agreement for Lease stage.  Detailed information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will only be available once the individual proposals have been fully cleared and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals documents and the respective Local Authorities have signed any Agreements for Lease arising.</p>  <p>  The scheme is now open on an ongoing basis from Q1 2019.</p></reply>

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, buying and leasing new social houses. All funding is conditional on the properties being made available to households on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing. The housing units are secured under long-term leases/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs, the cost of which is recouped to local authorities by my Department. The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the establishment of the Housing Agency Acquisition Fund.</p><p>The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years. All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.</p><p>To date, 26 AHBs have availed of CALF to secure homes for social housing use. Funding eligibility is aligned to those AHBs signed up to and demonstrating compliance with the Voluntary Regulation Code.</p><p>The CALF scheme delivers housing through close collaboration between AHBs and local authorities.  This collaborative approach ensures that there is local authority support for the project prior to submission to my Department.  Applications for funding for a scheme or individual homes, which have not progressed, may have fallen out of the process for various reasons and applications may also be resubmitted with revisions or by another AHB.  Some 1,000 applications (with some 12,000 associated dwellings) for CALF have been made since 2011.</p><p>The CALF was introduced on 24 June 2011 and only a small number of AHBs availed of the facility during the period 2011 to 2013, delivering a total of 498 additional social housing homes under the scheme. Only over the last number of years has the sector moved to accessing private funding/ borrowing and moving away from full exchequer support. Since 2014, the number of homes delivered using CALF support has increased significantly year on year, along with Exchequer funding to support AHBs to access finance for the provision of new social housing. CALF expenditure in 2018 was &euro;120.8 million; this included &euro;2.18 million, which was offset against Local Property Tax funding, and 2,315 additional social housing homes were completed in 2018, as a result of CALF assistance. A provision of &euro;94.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2019.</p><p>At the end of Q4 2018, there were some 3,600 homes in the CALF acquisition and build pipeline, which will be delivered out to 2022. To date &euro;220 million had been loaned by local authorities to AHBs and a further &euro;231 million has been approved for lending but has not been drawn down.</p><p>Owing to the nature of the CALF scheme, home delivery does not always arise in the same year as expenditure being incurred. Schemes delivered under phased programmes may cross a number of payment periods.</p><p>Delivery under CALF since 2014 is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Delivery Type </th><th>2014 </th><th>2015 </th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018 </th></tr><tr><td>CALF Build </td><td>16 </td><td>43 </td><td>283 </td><td>854 </td><td>1,540 </td></tr><tr><td>CALF Acquisition<br /><br />(including Housing Agency Acquisitions since 2017) </td><td>303 </td><td>331 </td><td>283 </td><td>403 </td><td>775 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>319 </td><td>374 </td><td>566 </td><td>1,257 </td><td>2,315 </td></tr></table>Details of the annual social housing output for each of the local authority areas, as well as the specific output under each of the funding programmes, are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.</p></reply>

It is important to note that unit delivery may not necessarily arise in the same year as funding advancement.</p><p>AHBs may also utilise the Capital Advance leasing Facility (CALF) in conjunction with a loan from the HFA. Dwellings constructed by AHBs using HFA finance are owned by AHBs and it is a condition of the funding that they are made available to local authorities for social housing using Payment and Availability Agreements (P&amp;amp;As).</p><p>With regard to leasing, in addition to the units which are supported through HFA funding outlined above, under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department supports AHBs to lease dwellings and make them available for social housing.

They are then made available to local authorities for social housing using Payment and Availability Agreements (P&amp;amp;As), the cost of which is recouped to local authorities by my Department.</p><p>Output under AHB leasing since 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>AHB Leasing </th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>523</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>492</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>412</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In order to qualify for social housing support and be placed on a housing list, an applicant must be assessed by the authority concerned as meeting all of the eligibility and need criteria set down in the legislation. Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations. </p><p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. </p><p>In terms of my role regarding housing policy, and recognising that there are people who do not qualify for social housing but find it very challenging to purchase or rent at market rates, the Government has brought in new measures specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes. </p><p>Affordable housing is generally targeted at households earning a maximum gross income of &euro;50,000 (single applicant) or &euro;75,000 (joint applicant). Affordable homes to buy will be delivered under a new statutory Scheme; the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 were commenced last year and I recently signed regulations in respect of the making of a Scheme of Priority, which local authorities must do before 18 June 2019. Further regulations and detailed guidance will issue to local authorities in due course.</p><p>This new Scheme replaces all previous affordable purchase schemes; is led by housing authorities; is a shared equity scheme with a fully repayable equity share/discount; and the equity repayments will be pooled into a strategic affordable housing fund managed by the Housing Funding Agency (HFA). </p><p>The Scheme is complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced from 1 February 2018, following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan. The new loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>Single applicants for the loan may earn up to &euro;50,000 gross per annum, while the combined income of joint applicants may be up to &euro;75,000 per annum.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings. The maximum dual-income threshold also applies to the new Affordable Purchase Scheme which will enable a maximum purchase price of c. &euro;320,000, which is in line with the purchase limits set out under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website: .  Subject to certain conditions, any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.</p><p>Given the affordability challenge faced by renters, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. The experience gained from initial cost rental projects in Enniskerry and Inchicore is informing the national approach to cost rental delivery at scale. My Department is engaged with the Housing Agency, the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and the Land Development Agency to develop the optimum funding, delivery and administrative frameworks.</p></reply>

The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing to be pursued by Irish Water and others between now and 2025 in order to achieve this vision. The Policy Statement can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link: -</p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025.pdf.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is specifically tasked under the legislation with protecting the interests of customers.  </p>  <p>  An important aspect of the CRU&rsquo;s work is ensuring that Irish Water&rsquo;s revenue is spent appropriately to improve services for customers. To facilitate this, in November 2016 the CRU outlined a framework of 19 key performance metrics against which it would monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s performance and progress over time. The metrics cover customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply, security of water supply and sewerage service. Monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s performance relative to these metrics will facilitate an evaluation by the CRU of the utility&rsquo;s performance. It also ensures that transparent data becomes available to customers through the publication of performance data. </p>  <p>  The most recent Irish Water Performance Assessment Report published by the CRU in February 2018 is available at the following weblink - www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CRU18034-Irish-Water-Performance-Assessment-Report-No.-2-February-2018.pdf . </p>  <p>  I understand that the CRU plans to publish a further Performance Assessment Report later this year.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2017 has strengthened the arrangement in place for stakeholder engagement, accountability and transparency in relation to the provision of water services.  The Water Advisory Body has been placed on a statutory footing and empowered to advise the Minister on the measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water for the purpose of increasing the confidence of members of the public in Irish Water and to report to an Oireachtas Committee on a quarterly basis on the performance of Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan.  The Act also established An For&aacute;m Uisce to provide a platform for public engagement on all matters relating to water as an environmental, social and economic resource.</p>  <p>  Based on the above, I am confident that appropriate arrangements are in place for the delivery of water services and the development of the Water Sector in line with the needs and expectations of customers and users. </p>  <p>  It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Prioritising geographical areas for operation of the scheme is informed by economic assessments which local authorities have completed in relation to the affordability issues in their areas.  Significant housing delivery is to be supported using the Serviced Site Fund (SSF) which will utilise a budget of &euro;310 million to provide site infrastructure support to help make available approximately 6,200 affordable homes over the next three years. An initial 10 projects have been approved for &euro;43m of funding under the first call for proposals under the SSF. It is intended that a second call will issue next month and the first homes are expected to be delivered next year.</p>  <p>  Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides the statutory basis for the delivery of the affordable housing scheme.   Whilst the purpose of the scheme is to primarily target support at first time buyers facing housing affordability challenges, Section 84 (4) of the Act 2009 allows for an exemption that a person must be a first time buyer.  It provides that those who are separated, divorced or whose marriage has been annulled would be able to make an application for an affordable purchase home, subject to certain conditions.  These include that the person concerned has not retained an interest in their previous family home, or that they are not beneficially entitled to an interest in a dwelling other than their previous family home.</p></reply>

This included a funding measure to support community connections to the public network operated by Irish Water.  The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services.  The Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, includes the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, Environmental Protection Agency, Health Service Executive, Department of Rural and Community Development and local authorities, through the County and City Management Association.  It has also consulted with other key stakeholders, including Irish Water.</p>  <p>  There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 addressed the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021, while Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector.</p>  <p>  Based on the recommendations of the Working Group, which took into account the lessons learnt in the first multi-annual funding cycle 2016-2018 as well as the ongoing developments in the wider water services sector, I approved the multi-annual programme for the 2019-2021 cycle.  The 2019-2021 funding cycle consists of eight measures. Most are further broken into sub-measures. These measures reflect the key challenges currently facing the rural water sector.</p>  <p>  Measure 6, Community Connections (Water and Wastewater), facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies and central wastewater collection systems by extension off the public network.  It includes a sub-measure, Community Connection: Wastewater Network. This sub-measure will support wastewater collection for population clusters, currently on deficient individual wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks), immediately adjacent to towns and villages, through the development of community wastewater connection networks as extensions to the existing public (Irish Water) wastewater collection system.</p>  <p>  There is significant cost involved in delivering, and particular professional skills needed to operate, a sewerage scheme. The operation by community-based groups of their own sewage treatment facilities, which are technically more complex than group water treatment facilities, has not been included under the Rural Water Programme. This is because of the difficulties for voluntary groups in managing and maintaining such facilities in the long term. The relevant sub-measure under the Programme is therefore designed with this in mind.</p>  <p>  Strand 2 of the considerations by the Working Group is currently underway and I expect a further report later in 2019. The long-term needs of rural towns and villages in respect of wastewater infrastructure is something that I expect the Working Group will be examining in this phase of its work.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  I understand that Irish Water will be bringing forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the National Planning Framework.  The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s Investment Plan. Irish Water will work with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to local authority core strategies. </p>  <p>  Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.  These submissions are currently being considered by the CRU and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.</p></reply>

The rate of the levy has been increased to 7% of the market value for sites listed on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards, to be applied from January 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. </p>  <p>  However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that while 10 local authorities have yet to populate their registers, 21 authority have and there are collectively over 360 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 120 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  To support this work, levy implementation progress reports were requested from local authorities.  All local authorities have submitted responses to this request which are currently being examined by my Department with a view to determining what, if any, further implementation supports may be required.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and  a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/framework_for_enhancing_fire_safety_in_dwellings.pdf.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/fire_safety_in_ireland_-_report_of_the_fire_safety_task_force.pdf. </p>  <p>  In addition, in relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review Part B &ndash; Fire Safety and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwellings only.  A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, which includes apartments, is being prepared for public consultation.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:</p>  <p>  -  Amendments to the Building  Control Regulations; </p>  <p>  -  Establishment of a  shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p>  <p>  -  The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry   Register Ireland) Bill.</p>  <p>  These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations. </p></reply>

The funding supports the delivery of various types of accommodation including group housing, halting sites and the refurbishment of existing units.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, and reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawdown in recent years,  in 2017 the Housing Agency commissioned a review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation to date.  This review had regard to targets contained in local authority TAPs and actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.   Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee recommended that an Independent Expert Group be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.

These plans set out programmes of measures to be implemented by a wide range of public and private stakeholders to safeguard our aquatic environment. In this regard, my Department is providing some funding to Inland Fisheries Ireland to carry out an inventory of barriers to fish movements at a national level. This research will inform a prioritised programme to address barriers to fish movement in the next river basin management planning cycle which runs from 2022-2027.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress, and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out on the Pyrite Remediation Board&rsquo;s website at www.pyriteboard.ie/. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material, and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite in concrete blocks.  It is not intended at this time to include houses damaged by pyrite in the blockwork in the pyrite remediation scheme.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that an Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016, to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo. Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the development of such a scheme. </p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review, on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

To address this, the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure.  This measure, which was provided for through the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, introduced the concept of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly.</p>  <p>Where the local authority in a designated RPZ wishes to offer a new RAS contract, RPZ limits must be observed in any contract negotiations.   This means that rent increases are capped at a maximum of 4% per annum for up to three years.  Rent reviews in respect of dwellings made available for social housing under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and located in RPZs must be undertaken in compliance with the governing RPZ legislation.  It is a matter for each local authority, as the lessee in RAS contracts, to ensure compliance with the RPZ legislation in respect of RAS dwellings.  </p></reply>

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the 2000 Act and is a reserved function of the elected members.</p>  <p>  Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to  the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions.</p>  <p>  My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI). Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 homes.</p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf. </p>  <p>  The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in section 180.  </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan, published last year, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure, commencing with an estimates provision of &euro;6 million in 2019.  The multi-annual programme will be initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects and make recommendations to my Department on suitable projects to be approved for funding.  It is expected that approval of projects for this first cycle multi-annual programme will take place in Q2 2019.</p></reply>

Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.</p>  <p>  Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I recently announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. </p>  <p>  Homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.</p>  <p>  Issues in relation to taxation are a matter for colleague the Minister for Finance.
