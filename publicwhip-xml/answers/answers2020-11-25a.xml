No. 448 of 2020 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 clearly sets out the temporary restrictions under Level 5 of the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID.  A list of essential services can be found at  and the list of essential retail outlets at Level 5 can be found at </p><p>Level 5 restricts people from physically going into non-essential stores in order to stop people congregating and browsing for non-essential goods, to limit the spread of the virus. All retailers &ndash; essential and non-essential &ndash; can however continue to trade via &lsquo;remote ordering&rsquo; and fulfil orders for all products including non-essential items, by online or by phone, for home delivery and for collection.</p><p>Retailers in Ireland are key partners in the effort to suppress the virus and are playing a critical role in the national response during level 5 trading restrictions.  Government are fully engaged with the sector and aware of their efforts to serve their customers and adhere to public health guidelines.  I and my colleague Minister of State Damien English TD met with the Retail Forum members on 21 October to remind those in the retail sector, of the need for strict adherence to the public health guidelines during Level 5.  Minister English has convened regular retail meetings since entering Level 5.</p><p>Preparations across Government Departments, local authorities and agencies are firmly focused on ensuring a smooth, safe and enjoyable reopening of retail for all as soon as it is safe to do so.  The current restrictions at Level 5 of the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 are in place until midnight 1st December 2020. The Government will make a decision on the current restrictions shortly.  </p></reply>

The scheme is aimed at Micro-Enterprises who are not eligible for the COVID-19 Restart/Restart Plus Grant or similar COVID-19 business restart grants. </p><p>The Micro Enterprise Assistance Fund provided eligible businesses with a voucher of between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 in respect of vouched expenditure for eligible businesses under the initiative.  This assistance is intended as a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers in the context of the pandemic.</p><p>The Micro-Enterprise Assistance Fund was provided under the July Stimulus and was made available to Micro Enterprises employing between 2 &ndash; 10 employees, that had experienced a 30% reduction in turnover due to COVID-19, but were otherwise ineligible for other government supports.</p><p>The decision to award this support on the basis of vouched expenditure is a normal procedure under public financial rules when disbursing public monies so as to ensure that Agency funds are applied for the purposes for which they are intended which includes building in risk mitigation measures such as evidence of actual and proper expenditure.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-25a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112500061#WRB01600"><p>Economic or labour migration policy is essentially the framework within which the State's employment permit system operates. It is designed to supplement Ireland's skills and labour supply over the short to medium term by allowing enterprises to recruit nationals from outside the EEA, where such skills or expertise cannot be sourced from within the EEA at that time.  </p>  <p>  The system is not orientated towards any particular country or region.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the occupation lists : the critical skills list in respect of skills that are in critical shortage in the labour market and the ineligible occupations lists for which a ready source of labour is available from within Ireland and the EEA. Every other job in the labour market, where an employer cannot find a worker, may be eligible for an employment permit. The employer must undertake a labour market needs test to ensure that those currently in the labour market are the first cohort of people from whom employers should seek to recruit.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy references an occupation currently on the critical skills list; business sales executives specialising in international sales roles with a non-EEA language. The evidence in respect of this occupation is that there is a skills shortage in the domestic /EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  Under the Employment Permit Acts, in order to work in Ireland, all non-EEA nationals require valid employment permit or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Department of Social Protection, through Intreo, as the national public employment service, helps to match supply and demand in the labour market through information, placement and active support services at local, national and European level. Intreo is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports. Designed to provide a more streamlined approach, Intreo offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike. </p>  <p>  Where a particular skills set is required, the Employer Relations Officers of the Department of Social Protection, can offer a service to employers, including multinational enterprises, whereby they can match the skills requirement to vacancies to identify potential candidates and can also engage with appropriate representative groups to identify groups through its networks and social media.</p></reply>

This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  With regard to the community banking model a project team comprising officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance was established to progress that particular commitment.  The final report was published by the respective Ministers on 4 July 2018. The report indicated that the Department of Finance would continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it would commission an independent external evaluation of the possibility or otherwise for promotion of the local public banking concept in Ireland.  That further report was published by the Department of Finance in December 2019 and concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the July 2018 report.</p>  <p>  The importance of the post office network has been clearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic where we have seen a range of initiatives through our post offices which have helped support local communities, the elderly and vulnerable.  </p>  <p>  The serious decline in the volume of mail and the impact of Covid on footfall through post offices, has had a severe impact on the postal network and I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Postmasters Union. I am also aware of the findings of the most recent Grant Thornton Report commissioned by the IPU, which are being considered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  </p>  <p>  While it is long-standing Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p></reply>

Nevertheless I am advised that EirGrid prepare an annual report outlining the levels of dispatch-down of renewable energy on the island of Ireland.  </p><p>The latest such report can be found here: .</p><p>This report contains information on historic dispatch down quantities dating back to 2011. As contained in this report, the dispatch-down energy from wind resources in 2019 was 711 GWh in Ireland. This is equivalent to 6.9% of the total available wind energy. </p><p>In the period between 2015 and 2019, there is no relevant corresponding retail value as curtailment was not compensated for during this period under regulatory rules set by the SEM Committee. The majority of the wind farms are not compensated for constraints. </p><p>In order to meet Ireland's target of 70% renewable electricity by 2030, very high penetrations of variable renewable electricity on the grid will be required. Currently EirGrid operate the power system with up to 65% of renewable power at a given time, including onshore wind and solar. By 2030, this will need to rise to 95% in real time and higher. </p><p>Continuing Eirgrid&rsquo;s programme &lsquo;Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System&rsquo; (DS3) as well as increasing storage and strengthening the network will be critical to minimising the levels of renewable energy sources that are curtailed or constrained down.  </p></reply>

These actions, which are further underpinned by the Programme for Government, include developing the electric vehicle charging network necessary to support the growth of EVs and to ensure the supply of infrastructure stays sufficiently ahead of demand. The development of a strategy to meet these objectives is currently underway.     </p>  <p>  While charging at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland, my Department is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle (EV) public charging network over the coming years. In this regard my Department will continue to provide support for EV charging infrastructure through the SEAI Public Charge Point Scheme. This scheme provides 75% of the capital costs up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. In addition, my Department is allocating &euro;2m in 2021 to support a new SEAI scheme for the development of "destination chargers" at locations such as hotels and shopping centres which will provide a significant contribution to the overall public charging network.    </p>  <p>  I am aware that some local authorities have already looked to innovative options to lead the way in dual usage municipal infrastructure and have installed lamp post chargers. Examples include those installed on Crofton Road, Dun Laoghaire by Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and in Swords by Fingal County Council. My Department will continue to work closely with Local Authorities on how best to expand the network of public charge points at both local and regional level and in doing so will explore all options available to local government in securing additional EV charging infrastructure through the  supports currently provided through the SEAI. </p></reply>

Since the publication of the NBP strategy in 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;3 billion. This was primarily on upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services. Today over 1.78m or 75% of premises in Ireland can access commercially available high speed broadband services. At end Q2 2020, fixed broadband subscriptions had increased to 1.49million, an increase of 3.4% compared to the same period in 2019. Of these, over 200,000 were fibre to the premises subscriptions, representing 13.5% of total fixed broadband subscriptions, reflecting an increase of 8.8% when compared to the same period in 2019.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, and in respect of commercial development, eir has indicated that it is currently delivering fibre to the home services to 576,000 premises and have announced plans to increase this coverage to approximately 1.8 million homes over a 5 year period; SIRO has already passed over 340,000 premises with fibre to the home and plan to provide coverage to 365,000 by the end of this year; and Virgin Media now provides high speed broadband to almost 1million premises and are continuing to expand its services.</p>  <p>  Significant additional investment is expected over the coming years which, in addition to the rollout of the NBP, will ensure that Ireland continues on an upward trajectory in terms of the high speed connectivity necessary to support the continued development of our digital economy and society. </p></reply>

My officials have recently written to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they are aware of this position.

I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  </p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible, and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including essential workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  </p>  <p>  Since the move to Level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.</p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation has eased the situation, it remains the case that there may still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. </p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.</p></reply>

Driving licences issued by the Member States of the European Union are mutually recognised. Therefore, a holder of an EU licence who moves to another Member State can drive on that licence until the licence expires. On expiry, the licence holder will then need to exchange their licence for the licence of the country they are now resident in.  </p>  <p>  After the transition period (transition period ends 31 December 2020), the UK will no longer be a Member State and so a UK driving licence will not be recognised here. Holders of UK licences resident in Ireland are therefore encouraged to exchange their UK licences for an Irish one before this date. </p>  <p>  However, legislation exists to allow for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes in the Road Traffic Acts.  Following the transition period, the potential then exists for arrangements to be made under those Acts and Ireland will be pursuing this option. This may take a little time to complete as it involves a formal agreement and legislation here in Ireland, as well as corresponding steps by the UK. </p></reply>

Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an on-course bookmaker or a coach or bus operator whose business is ordinarily operated from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria. Coach operators may be able to benefit from the Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, a &euro;10million fund to provide coach tourism businesses with a direct financial contribution to help support them with future operational and continuity plans.</p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.  Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, and I have no plans to extend eligibility of the scheme.</p></reply>

Clubs and their members have played an important role in the community response to Covid-19 and I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that they may be facing, and that they, like all impacted borrowers, will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, at the outset of the pandemic in March, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) announced a coordinated approach by banks and other lenders to help their customers who were economically impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers. However, each borrower&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach has been adopted as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September and indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty. The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties in meeting their loan repayments will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed. </p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank protection framework will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19. </p></reply>

However, due to the nature of the services procured by my Department, which are generally very specialised and technical in nature, it has not been possible to incorporate social clauses into any contracts to date. </p><p>My Department has 17 Bodies under its aegis of which 7 fall into the category of being &lsquo;commercial or non-commercial State bodies or private entities subsidised by 50% or more of public funding&rsquo;.

Some examples are set out below:</p><p>- Energy: the NTMA has specified 100% green energy for their own utilities and has sought details of green initiatives such as renewable energy from providers.</p><p>- Technology Supplies: the NTMA has sought devices that are energy efficient in addition to having an overall low environmental impact.</p><p>- Labour Force: the NTMA has required a competitive package for staff of service providers, including being paid a living wage.</p><p>- Waste: the NTMA has required providers to demonstrate sustainability and waste management addressing waste minimisation with proposals to achieve a target of zero waste to landfill.  Other areas such as paper-lite and recycling, and carbon footprint have also been addressed. </p><p>It should also be noted that the NTMA provides support services, including facility services, to Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI). </p></reply>

A subsidy of between &euro;203 and &euro;350 may be claimed by the employer retrospectively for every worker who is paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 per week.  </p>  <p>  This is different from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) where the level of income given for each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the EWSS is to maintain the link between the employee and employer insofar as is possible.  It is therefore based on the number of employees on the payroll and the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain as close to 100% of normal income as possible for the duration of the subsidy period. </p>  <p>  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim an EWSS subsidy in respect of that employee.  Outside of that, the position in relation to the EWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay and hours worked. </p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Bill as published provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The Bill also introduces a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties facing retailers, especially businesses in the tourism sector, I am bringing forward an amendment at committee stage to reduce the threshold to &euro;75. This reduction retains protections for the exchequer while also acknowledging the potential impact that not making this change would have on retailers across the country at this difficult time.</p></reply>

It aims to further enhance consumer protection and ensure a level playing field by extending the scope of the directive to include all sales of insurance products.  This Directive was transposed into Irish law by the <i>European Union (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 229/2018)</i>as amended, and Article 17(1) in the question was transposed through Regulation 30(1) of the Regulations.  </p><p>With regard to the enforcement of the Directive, the Regulations designate the Central Bank of Ireland as the relevant competent authority in the State.  I understand that the European Commission recently confirmed to my Department that it had no issues concerning the completeness of the national transposition measures in respect of the Directive. </p><p>With regard to the interaction between the Directive and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Review on differential pricing, I understand that the purpose of the Review is to examine the extent to which the practice of differential pricing (whereby customers with similar risk and cost of service are charged different premiums, for reasons other than risk and cost of service) is consistent with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;).  The Deputy will be aware that the Code requires firms to <i>inter alia</i>act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers; and make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges. In addition, it is seeking to establish the impact of differential pricing on consumers; identify the drivers of consumer behaviours including how consumers engage with the insurance industry; assess the extent to which these pricing practices lead to outcomes consistent with the Code; and assess the governance and oversight of differential pricing.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Central Bank&rsquo;s review is ongoing and in this regard, I believe that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the review in advance of reaching any conclusions.  </p><p>In conclusion, differential pricing is undoubtedly a complex issue and will need careful consideration of any potential remedies, and what overall impact they would have on consumers.  We need to guard against the risk of unintended consequences in that in attempting to address an issue we don&rsquo;t create an undesirable knock-on impact elsewhere.  This could include discouraging competition or new entrants to the market, all of which is not in Irish consumers long-term interests.</p></reply>

The funding, which is being allocated by Sport Ireland, will address the existential threat to National Governing Bodies and their club networks, allowing sports organisations to offset significant losses incurred in recent months and add a semblance of certainty to planning for 2021. The significant investment will reach all levels of the sport sector with National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and thousands of grassroots clubs across Ireland set to benefit. </p><p>The funding package includes COVID-19 funding of &euro;70 million, which will provide support for the three main field sports organisations (the FAI, GAA and IRFU), a Resilience Fund to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport, a Sports Club Resilience Fund to support clubs, and a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund.</p><p>Under the Sports Restart and Renewal Fund, over &euro;1.9 million was allocated to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs).  The primary aim of the grants is to cover the costs associated with implementing Covid-19 hygiene and social distancing protocols. The club grant scheme is designed and intended to support return to sporting activities only.  A breakdown of the amounts allocated by Sport Ireland to the LSPs is available on Sport Ireland's website at the following: .  </p><p>As this scheme is funded by Sport Ireland and operated by the Local Sports Partnerships, I am arranging for Sport Ireland to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific club mentioned.  Please contact my private office if you do not hear within ten working days.</p><p>In regard to the Sports Capital Programme, a full Review of the 2018 round has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the 2020 round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review.  I intend to publish the guide to making an application and to launch the programme before the end of this month. This will include the specific details of when applications will be accepted but I expect this to be from early December. To take account of travel and other restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic I intend to give applicants until early February to complete the application process.  It is planned to make allocations later in  2021.  </p></reply>

To help the sector,  I recently announced funding allocations under the (1) "Music Industry Stimulus Package" and (2) "Live Performance Support Scheme" which resulted in:</p>  <p>  1.  184 musicians/bands are being awarded a total of &euro;896,000 to assist them to record singles, EPs and albums. This support covers a wide range of music genres including rock, indie, jazz, trad, folk, country, classical and electronic. There were over 1,400 applications for recording support, which reflects the high demand for support as well as being an indication of the vibrancy of the music sector in Ireland. The total funding for the 2020 Music Industry Stimulus Package of &euro;1.7 million is supporting 79 song writing camps and 56 new album releases as well as the 184 recording awards announced.</p>  <p>  2.  Over &euro;5 million in funding to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters to plan live performances across the country over the coming months, with a total of 59 organisations benefitting from the scheme. The main objective of this pilot scheme is to provide employment opportunities in this uncertain time and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead with either a live audience or to share content through streaming.</p>  <p>  The Government will also provide support for live entertainment in the amount of &euro;50 million in 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector, and will support live entertainment in venues across the country, building on the stimulus measures announced in July. This funding will also support:</p>  <p>  -  Work opportunities for musicians, artists, crew and venue workers nationwide. </p>  <p>  -  Supports for music, building on the phenomenal demand for support under the July stimulus Music Scheme operated by First Music Contact. </p>  <p>  -  A scheme of capital grants for equipment will also operate in 2021. </p>  <p>  -  Combined with measures announced by the Minister for Finance, this will provide additional supports to a sector severely impacted by COVID-19.</p></reply>

This precludes any exercise class, including gymnastics classes, and any type of dance class &ndash; traditional, step, jazz, or ballet.  Similarly, the guidance precludes any indoor gathering takings place at Levels 3, 4, and 5 and to date no exemptions have been made. </p><p>Given the epidemiological situation with reducing the still high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and considerable numbers of hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of COVID-19 and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including cultural activities.</p><p>At present, Ireland is at Level 5 of <i>The Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>.  The public health risk at level 5 means that we are all asked to stay at home, with limited exceptions.  Information on the public health measures currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at the gov.ie website.</p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020 give effect to level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  The Regulations list essential retail and essential services which may operate under level 5 restrictions.  This list does not include private or commercial dance classes.  Under the Regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. </p><p>Similarly, The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, regardless of the form e.g. Irish, ballet, jazz etc.  </p><p>I fully understand the benefits that activities such as dance bring to peoples overall health and well-being. The measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests in so far as possible.</p></reply>

One of the earliest priorities of both Minister O&rsquo;Brien and I was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while simultaneously supporting local authorities.</p>  <p>  &euro;600m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of a six-month waiver of rates from 27 March to 27 September 2020.  To strengthen this support the Government subsequently announced an extension of the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m. This brings to &euro;900m the financial support to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates, which is an unprecedented measure that offers support to businesses and certainty to local authorities.</p>  <p>  The waiver applies to the majority of ratepayers, with a small number of categories excluded, such as utilities, banks, large supermarkets and corporates, whose businesses have not generally been as severely impacted by the pandemic.  However, in acknowledgement that some ratepayers in the excluded categories may have closed during the period of the public health restrictions or were otherwise adversely affected, ratepayers in these categories  may also be eligible, if they can demonstrate that the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on their business.  Ratepayers should engage with directly their local authority in this regard.  </p>  <p>  For clarity, the commercial rates waiver refers to 2020 and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic only; the scheme is unrelated to Brexit. </p></reply>

This increase arises mainly from the contribution towards increased pay and pension costs resulting from the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation and relating to the Public Sector Stability Agreement, which as increased from &euro;109.6m to &euro;130.3m.</p>  <p>  The local authority budget process for 2021 is now underway. In that context, Minister O'Brien and I recently wrote to each local authority to advise that, in light of the fact that the future trajectory of Covid-19 is unclear, it is not currently possible for Government to make open-ended commitments in respect of commercial rates or other income pressures that may arise in 2021. This is reflected in the figures referred to in the question. However, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage regularly and constructively with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and other matters arising. </p></reply>

A number of contracts in the facilities management area, for example, include social clauses as per the Department's Universal Design and Access Policy and associated Action Plan.  The Department has liaised with the OPW on introducing numerous improvements to the accessibility of our offices in line with this policy and plan.  Furthermore, Office of Government Procurement (OGP) frameworks, which include social criteria, have been used by my Department during this period e.g. under the transport framework, 10% of the taxi fleet must be wheelchair accessible. </p><p>My Department is currently finalising a three-year Corporate Procurement Plan (CPP) and this will take account of the requirement for social and green public procurement to be incorporated into tender processes and contracts.

The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes and the increased build targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land. </p>  <p>  In progressing this major construction programme it is important to pursue timely delivery while also ensuring value for money in terms of Exchequer funding. In this regard, social housing projects, like all publicly-funded construction projects, must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Public Spending Code and Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability. </p>  <p>  My Department, working with local authorities has sought to streamline its "4-stage" approval process for social housing and to introduce other measures to increase the pace of delivery. As a result of this work a pre-construction programme of 59 weeks was agreed, which includes design, Part 8 approval, detailed design, preparation of tender documentation, issuing tenders and tender reports. The 59-weeks includes 15 weeks for the requisite Department approvals, which occur in parallel with local authority activities where possible.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been able to reduce this pre-construction timeline further using design and build frameworks. Off-site construction has also been used to reduce local authority construction timelines.</p>  <p>  Building on this work, in September I increased the Single-Stage Approval Process for local authority Social Housing Capital Construction Projects from &euro;2m to &euro;6m, to give further autonomy to local authorities to progress projects by reducing the number of approvals sought from the Department from four to one. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 20 projects (50 units) (under &euro;2m) currently going through the single stage process and one project (under &euro;6m) about to transition due to the increased limit. To date approximately 35 projects (113 units) are on site or completed having used the single stage process.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I established a High Level Housing Delivery Group which meets regularly and includes key stakeholders from the local authorities Approved Housing Bodies, the Housing Agency and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (HDCO). This Group meets regularly to monitor and coordinate delivery of social housing programmes and to identify and address any systemic issue that could block or delay progress. </p></reply>

The LDA Bill will focus on the establishment of the corporate form and financial structure of the Agency. Once the primary legislation is in place, arrangements will be finalised in relation to the capitalisation of the LDA with funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion being provided from ISIF.  My Department is currently working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the draft legislation to ensure the LDA are given all necessary powers to carry out its functions. </p>  <p>  The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which brings essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market.</p>  <p>  Along with its initial 8 sites, the LDA is working in partnership with local authorities to develop and master plan a range of strategic sites. One example is the Shanganagh Castle site. The LDA, in partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, have been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on this site. It is intended that approximately 34% of the units in this development will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. </p>  <p>  As part of its remit, the LDA is also working to develop an inventory of all relevant public lands to allow for better management of these land assets, including their strategic planning and urban regeneration potential. This database will contain information on all relevant public lands including location, mapping and title. It is intended that the forthcoming LDA Bill will provide that all state bodies will be obliged to assist the LDA in the compilation of the database, where appropriate. It also provides that the LDA will report to the Minister periodically on the optimal use of public lands. In accordance with the Programme for Government, the LDA Bill will require all public bodies disposing of lands to first offer them for sale to the LDA. </p>  <p>  In line with its mandate, the LDA will retain experienced staff with extensive skills and experience in project management, finance, planning, development, law and procurement and will provide professional services to master-plan key sites/areas for development in key urban areas, in partnership with local authorities and other state bodies. For example, the LDA is currently working with Limerick City and County Council on a site near Colbert Station, funding a master plan of the site which consists of lands owned by the Council, CIE, the Department of Education and the HSE. It is also working closely with Cork City Council in relation to the development of Cork Docklands. The LDA currently has 41 staff members and it is actively recruiting further staff with the required skill sets and expects to have 80 employees by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

On average my Department will receive ten or more requests a year to facilitate the operation of polling stations by foreign Embassies. </p><p>In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and following consultations with the Department of Health, my Department instituted a number of additional requirements to ensure that public health measures were adhered to where an Embassy wished to operate a polling station.

Following confirmation that it was not legally possible to facilitate postal voting, officials from my Department engaged intensively with the Embassy to ensure that polling would be carried out in compliance with public health guidelines.</p><p>With the move to Level 5 of <i>The Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19</i>on 22 October, and following further consultation with the Department of Health, the Embassy was requested  to put a number of additional public health measures in place to ensure that voting could be carried out in a safe manner.</p><p>Under the regulations governing Level 5 restrictions, in particular Statutory Instrument 448/2020, provision is made to allow for those engaged in providing, or accessing, essential services to move outside the 5km limit. The list of essential services includes &ldquo;The provision of services essential to the functioning of diplomatic missions and consular posts in the State&rdquo;. The Department of Foreign Affairs considers the operation of a polling station by a diplomatic Mission to allow its citizens to vote to be a service essential to the functioning of a diplomatic Mission in the State. </p><p>Polling stations were set up at the RDS by the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova for the Moldovan Presidential elections, which were held on Sunday 15 November. Following written confirmation from the Embassy of its ability to adhere to public health measures, my Department confirmed that Moldovan citizens who were eligible to vote were permitted to travel outside the 5km limit for the express purpose of accessing the polling stations. Voters travelling to the polling stations had to be in a position to present evidence of their entitlement to vote. The Moldovan diaspora made up approximately 15% of the total numbers voting in the Presidential elections, with polling taking place in a number of countries across Europe.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation. </p>  <p>  An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. For individuals born outside of Ireland, they may claim citizenship if they had at least one parent who was born in the island of Ireland before 2005. </p>  <p>  Individuals born outside of Ireland can also claim citizenship through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth, or through a grandparent born in Ireland. Individuals who wish to claim citizenship through these means must have his/her birth entered on the Foreign Births Register (FBR). Citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. Further details regarding the process can be consulted at the Passport Service's website. </p>  <p>  There are no provisions for the spouse or partner of an Irish citizen to acquire Irish citizenship solely by virtue of marriage or civil partnership. Post nuptial citizenship was repealed with effect from 30 November 2005. There is no provision to apply for post nuptial citizenship retrospectively. </p>  <p>  An individual may apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. Minimum residency terms must be satisfied before an individual is eligible for citizenship through naturalisation. The Department of Justice is responsible for citizenship matters, including applications for naturalisation.</p></reply>

It comprises two Votes; Vote 27 International Cooperation and Vote 28 Foreign Affairs. </p>  <p>  The Department ensures that there is an appropriate focus on good practice in procurement and that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with all relevant procurement guidelines. Procurement takes place in compliance with Directive 2014/24/EU and supported by Procurement Guidelines published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). </p>  <p>  These rules require the Department to award contracts under procedures designed to achieve value for public money in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory competitive process.</p>  <p>  The Department, as a contracting authority, recognises that public procurement can be used to promote wider social considerations. The general position from a procurement perspective is that social criteria can be included in the procurement process provided that they are linked to the subject matter of the contract and are contract specific.</p>  <p>  The range of policy areas that come under social considerations include, for example environment sustainability, disability access, good employment practices, training for young or disadvantaged people.</p>  <p>  I recognise that social clauses are most effectively utilised in large-scale works contracts as opposed to contracts for goods and services. The majority of the Departments procurement contracts are with small firms or individuals providing professional, consultancy and general services.  However, procurement contracts in the Department for general services and ICT managed services requires contractors, as employers, to be fully compliant with labour rules, collective agreements and the EU Employment Directives. Tenderers are excluded from competition if they fail to meet the required social criteria.</p>  <p>  Other examples of social considerations in the Departments procurement contracts under environment sustainability is the introduction of solar panel energy to a number of our Embassies abroad with further projects planned and the introduction of product specifications for the purchase of hybrid motor vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Department will proceed to implement social clauses in its procurement contracts in a targeted manner in compliance with the 2019 OGP Guidance Note and the EU Procurement Directive.</p></reply>

There are credible allegations of mass casualties, including civilian casualties, and of human rights abuses. There is a grave risk of a humanitarian crisis. Tigray is home to many refugees, displaced persons and local communities already coping with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. If not contained, this conflict could threaten the stability of Ethiopia, Africa&rsquo;s second most populous country, and have serious regional implications for the wider Horn of Africa, one of the continent&rsquo;s most fragile regions. </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  The situation in Ethiopia was raised by HRVP Borrell at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 19 November. Minister Coveney intervened calling for continued EU efforts to push for a resolution of the crisis, and stressed the need to act fast and collectively to call for unconditional, unrestricted access for humanitarian actors to affected areas.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa is engaging closely with other EU Heads of Mission, the UN and other members of the international community in monitoring, reporting and advocating on the situation and in preparing for an emergency humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral development cooperation programme is in Ethiopia.  The Embassy of Ireland is in the process of providing &euro;416,000 to the humanitarian response in Tigray, along with a projected &euro;500,000 to support refugees in Eastern Sudan. My Department is actively looking at ways to address other critical funding needs in light of the escalating humanitarian situation.</p>  <p>  In the context of our upcoming tenure on the UN Security Council, Ireland will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the current conflict.</p></reply>

NEPS provides a casework service to schools through the assigned NEPS psychologist, or sometimes, temporarily, via the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological assessments &ndash; SCPA.  Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team (in post-primary) feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. This year due to Covid19 some elements of casework service is modified to ensure compliance with public health and your school&rsquo;s safety measures. </p><p>In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p><p>In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  </p><p>Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p><p>My Department works closely with the Department of Health and will be represented on the newly established National Implementation Monitoring Committee which will drive and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Sharing the Vision &ndash; a Mental Health Policy for Everyone. </p><p>The curriculum also plays an important role in teaching students about managing their wellbeing. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing. Wellbeing crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. When planning a Wellbeing Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. In particular the Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Wellbeing is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the schools Junior Cycle programme.  At primary level SPHE is mandatory SPHE supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. </p>  <p>  The provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies within the remit of the Department of Health, and the HSE specifically. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support. </p>  <p>  A key part of wellbeing promotion in any school is In relation to anti-bullying, the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. There is a requirement in the procedures for the School Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management on the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures. The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be available and published on the school website. There is no requirement for reporting centrally to the Department. My Department's approach in the procedures is that the Inspectorate, as part of its inspection of schools, specifically examine schools compliance with the anti-bullying procedures including the actions taken to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. </p>  <p>  My Department is working along with other Government Departments and agencies to support the full implementation of the national drug strategy - Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025 &ndash; participating on both the National Oversight Committee   leading and directing on its implementation and on the Strategy Standing Sub Committee on the overall co-ordination and implementation of the strategy actions. My Department participated in the development of the strategy and is leading on a number of actions to build the skills, knowledge and resilience and wellbeing in all of our children so they are equipped to deal with the challenges they face and to enable them to achieve their full potential and be the best they can be.</p>  <p>   In 2019, &lsquo;Know the Score&rsquo; was launched. This is a resource for teachers of senior cycle students aimed at guiding and supporting them to improve their knowledge and strengthen their skills in dealing with the risks associated with alcohol and drugs. &lsquo;Know the Score&rsquo; is the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students and was developed in partnership between public health and education professionals, with input from teachers and young people.</p></reply>

Firstly, I will outline the role of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department. NEPS provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners.

NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development.  NEPS psychologists provide a Support and Development service to schools that includes planning meetings, consultation, cluster group meetings and more formal teacher professional learning opportunities which includes teacher professional learning programmes such as the Friends Resilience Programmes and the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning programme.  These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  My Department is working to adapt these programmes for online delivery later in the academic year. </p>  <p>  NEPS also supports school leaders and teachers to establish and operate student support teams.  Student Support Teams are part of the student support system in a school. </p>  <p>  At primary level Social, Personal, Health Education (SPHE) is mandatory and it supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships. Since September 2020, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Primary Health and Wellbeing team have been providing bespoke (virtual) CPD and support to schools in the following areas; Teaching and Learning in SPHE (including visual arts), Stay Safe Programme, RSE, Anti-bullying (including Internet Safety and Cyber-bullying), Teacher Wellbeing and Restorative Practice. PDST&rsquo;s Wellbeing support is rooted in the SPHE curriculum. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, all students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing. Wellbeing crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. When planning a Wellbeing Programme, schools can access the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. Strand 4 of the SPHE short course -  My Mental Health, focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times.  Teachers can access support from the PDST and the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) for these areas of the curriculum. The PDST facilitates a Mental Health 2-Day Seminar each year. Due to the current context, PDST&rsquo;s Mental Health Seminar has been postponed until 2021. Since September 2020, PDST advisors have facilitated online bespoke in-school support. During PDST&rsquo;s support engagements, they have supported schools through facilitated dialogue around Junior and Senior Cycle SPHE and RSE.</p>  <p>  The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice was published by my Department in July 2018 and sets out the ambition and vision of the Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school.  The policy describes how schools can best promote wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Policy Statement indicates that schools should adopt a whole-school, multi-component, preventative approach to wellbeing promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions.   </p>  <p>  Since the policy was published, significant work has taken place to realise the vision set out. A Wellbeing Office has been established in NEPS to support the implementation of the Wellbeing Policy and a Wellbeing Steering Group, oversees the implementation of the Policy.  In order to develop the required Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and resources for schools, the Department worked with 30 schools (10 post primary and 20 primary) in an Action Research Project to support the implementation of the Wellbeing Promotion Process.  The work was led by the PDST in collaboration with Junior Cycle Teachers (JCT) and NEPS. This findings from this research project will assist the Department in reviewing and planning for the needs of schools and centres for education in relation to wellbeing promotion nationally. </p>  <p>  A number of key resources have been made available to schools and further supports will be made available.  These include Statements of Effective Practice to guide and standardise the approach to reviewing wellbeing promotion in schools, parent, teacher and student questionnaires and directories of CPD and online support available from the Department, its support services and the HSE in the area of wellbeing</p>  <p>  My Department will continue the coordinated implementation of the Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy over the coming months.  </p></reply>

Medmark, the current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance.</p>  <p>  A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the employee to Medmark, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.   The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  An employee is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, higher risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  </p>  <p>  Under the current HSE guidelines, a pregnant employee is not deemed to be at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, unless suffering from a serious heart condition. A teacher who is well must therefore attend the workplace.  The school has a responsibility as the employer to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full.  </p>  <p>  If this, or any other relevant medical matter, is reviewed and updated by the HSE, Medmark will be informed as the occupational health service provider, by the HSE, and will adjust their decision making processes accordingly.  </p>  <p>  Where an employee considers the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, a review can be requested by the employee where Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The employee may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. </p></reply>

Music schools are not recognised schools as set out by the Education Act. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in relation to the particular concern of music classes in schools. The position is that in person drama classes, dance classes and music classes are suspended between levels 3 and 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19.   </p>  <p>  Education is, however, considered an essential service under the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020, which give effect to the level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  Under Part 2 of the schedule to the regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible.  </p>  <p>  As such, some drama, music and dance lessons may take place where they are required to comply with the national curriculum for primary and post-primary education. For these classes, schools are required to ensure that infection prevention control measures are in place in line with the School&rsquo;s COVID-19 response plan and public health advice to limit the risk of spread of infection. </p>  <p>  These arrangements do not include classes which are extra-curricular classes i.e. those which an individual is pursuing outside of the school day for their own personal development or are courses of additional study outside of the school day but which relate to the curriculum e.g. grinds.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this vital aspect of education to young people. The Programme for Government states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools. Work on the development of an updated curriculum and interim guidelines for RSE has been ongoing following the publication of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. </p>  <p>  Schools are required to teach RSE as an integral component of Junior Cycle SPHE up to Third Year. Schools are also required to teach Senior Cycle RSE even in the absence of timetabled SPHE classes. School policy will determine the context of the RSE programme and delivery will involve a co-ordinated approach, including both core class periods and cross curricular work.</p>  <p>  Survey data published by my Department in respect of 2015 (Lifeskills Survey) showed that just over a quarter of respondent post-primary schools reported meeting the requirement of providing six RSE classes per year. 16% provided three to five classes per year, 41% provided one to two classes per year, while 5% provided none.</p>  <p>  More recent data from 2018 indicated that just under half of respondent post-primary schools are meeting the requirement to provide six RSE classes per year, with 14% providing three to five classes, 26% providing one to two classes per year and 4% providing none. </p></reply>

These supports include the household benefits, telephone support allowance and fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The household benefits package (HHB) is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;265 million this year on HHB.  It consists of the gas / electricity element of the package (&euro;35 a month) and the free TV licence element. </p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;24.50 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;686 for the fuel season) from October to April at an estimated cost of &euro;261 million in 2020.  The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  In Budget 2021, I announced an increase of &euro;3.50 a week in the weekly rate of Fuel Allowance payable.  While the increase in the fuel allowance payment took account of the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels from May 2021, the fuel allowance rate will increase from the 4th January 2021 thus ensuring recipients will benefit from the increased payment over this winter period.</p>  <p>  As a result of the Covid-19 Emergency, the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection secured Government approval to extend the 2019 / 2020 Fuel Allowance season by an additional four weeks.  This extended the payment of &euro;24.50 per week to all recipients of the fuel allowance from Friday 10 April (when it was due to expire) until Friday 8 May 2020 at an estimated additional cost of over &euro;31m.   </p>  <p>  The telephone support allowance (TSA) is a weekly payment of &euro;2.50.  The estimated full year cost of the scheme is over &euro;17.5 million.  To receive the allowance a customer of my Department must be in receipt of a qualifying payment such as the State pension and also be in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.  The scheme supports recipients by assisting with the cost of communications and/or home security solutions.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances with special heating requirements.  In addition, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  </p>  <p>  While I fully understand that these are difficult and distressing times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

In that context, I am happy to confirm that the timeframe for returning the completed form has been extended by an additional 30 days.

The CE scheme can play an important role in breaking the cycle of long-term unemployment for some people and improve their chances of employment.</p>  <p>  The 2020 CE Budget is &euro;364 million.  At the end of February 2020, prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, there were 21,131 participants on CE.  At the end of October 2020 there were 19,244 participants on CE.</p>  <p>  During the first phase of the Covid-19 emergency earlier in the year,  my Department continued to provide the necessary funding for CE schemes while also introducing a number of contingency measures.  These measures included the extension of all existing CE participant contracts for the duration of the emergency enabling many CE schemes and their CE participants to continue to deliver their range of services to the community.</p>  <p>  Following the Government's introduction of Level-5 restrictions in October, the Department reintroduced these contingency arrangements and continued to provide funding for CE schemes.  Department officials have been liaising with CE schemes to arrange for those participants who were due to finish during the period Level-5 restrictions are in place, to have their contracts extended until restrictions ease, unless a participant is taking up employment or reaches the State Pension age. </p>  <p>  While referrals to CE schemes can continue in current circumstances, the number of referrals from Intreo Offices may be impacted by the need to deploy Intreo staff to other frontline duties and in order to comply with public health restrictions.  During this period, CE sponsoring authorities are also being encouraged to continue to promote awareness of the benefits of CE in their local communities, ensuring that CE vacancies are well publicised.  They can advertise CE their existing CE vacancies free of charge on the Department's JobsIreland website.</p>  <p>  Once restrictions begin to be lifted there will be a renewed focus  on identifying long-term unemployed candidates for available CE vacancies and to fill the additional places provided for under the July Jobs Stimulus.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

Both options commenced with one year of participation with the possibility of either one or two more years, depending on the option taken.  Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major QQI award.</p><p>In 2017 the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced and a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:</p><p>&lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage.  If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;</p><p>The saver clause that was introduced allowed CE participants who commenced under that option to continue on CE for a maximum of three consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous. The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively.<i></i></p><p>The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  CE participation was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years. </p><p>In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year's participation on CE is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  The same rules and eligibility criteria attached to participation on CE are applied throughout the country.  </p><p>The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  </p><p>While I understand that CE participants may wish to remain on a CE scheme for longer than the permissible time, the Deputy will appreciate that such extensions would have a detrimental effect on other long-term unemployed candidates wishing to avail of the opportunities afforded by CE.</p><p>I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

Participation limits on these schemes are necessary to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons.  It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market.</p><p>Following 12 months in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment CE placements for those aged between 21 and 55 years will be for one year. However, if a CE participant is working towards a QQI Major Award or working towards a recognised industry standard, their time on CE can be extended by up to a maximum of 3 years to complete the full award/qualification standard i.e. a total participation of 3 consecutive years in which to complete any outstanding modules.</p><p>The person concerned will have completed three years on CE on 11th December and their employment should cease on that date. However having reviewed the position my Department will continue to fund this participant placement up to 15 January 2021 to ensure no disruption of payment over the Christmas period.</p><p>The Department's Activation service will work with the person concerned to ensure that the skills  and experience they received during their time on CE are maximised.  This process will help identify potential employment opportunities and offer support to them in overcoming any barriers to employment.</p><p>  The Department strongly supports the work being done through Community Employment schemes and the vital roles they are playing in local communities. Community Employment vacancies are advertised on and are promoted and supported  locally  by the Department's Activation service.</p></reply>

JobPath's role is not to source actual jobs for participants. </p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and October 2020, some 283,826 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service and of these 168,155 have completed at least one full engagement with JobPath. In the same period, 64,632 jobseekers had commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  Of these, 40,876 have sustained employment for 13 weeks, 32,811 have sustained employment for 26 weeks, 26,992 have sustained employment for 39 weeks and 22,581 were still employed after twelve months. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service. They have not yet had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain statistics on the specific types of employment commenced through JobPath.  </p>  <p>  However, an econometric review of JobPath, published last year, noted that in 2018 the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment with the JobPath service are 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath. Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes in the same period, it means the overall positive employment/earnings impact is 37% in 2018 for those who are supported by the JobPath service.  These findings indicate that jobseekers who engage with JobPath are more likely to get a positive employment outcome than those jobseekers who aren't supported by the service. </p></reply>

Where the records of children in care are concerned, the Ryan Report recommended that reports, files and records essential to validate the child&rsquo;s identity and their social, family and educational history must be retained (recommendation 7.20).</p><p>Following the publication of the Report a detailed Implementation Plan was prepared and published in July 2009. Of the ninety-nine actions contained in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, ninety-five are now complete. The two outstanding actions referred to in the original Parliamentary Question (No. 591 of 22 September 2020) are the responsibility of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>These actions, which are aimed at ensuring the records of people who have been in care are stored securely and are available to those to whom they relate in future, are being addressed by Tusla through the ongoing development of the National Childcare Information System (NCCIS). The Agency has implemented the NCCIS to maintain records of children in care. The NCCIS has been fully implemented in all Tusla areas and is the central repository/ archive for current children in care records. Tusla has also successfully completed the data migration to the NCCIS of all historical children in care records held in legacy ICT systems formerly managed by the HSE. The NCCIS programme and subsequent successful migration projects represent significant progress on the implementation of the relevant actions.</p><p>Tusla has advised that further initiatives are planned under the Tusla Data Management Strategy 2019-2022 to extend the NCCIS repository to cover the registration of historical children in care paper files held by the Agency. This includes completing an audit of all paper file locations and recording high-level information on the NCCIS, such as the child&rsquo;s details, as well as references to the physical location of all related paper files. </p><p>Historical children in care records, which were held by the HSE, transferred to Tusla with the establishment of the Agency under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. These records date back to the 1970s when the health boards were established. Examples of care records held by Tusla are care orders; birth certificates; admission to care records; daily logs; key working records; care plans; family history; risk assessments; medical records; records of significant events; complaints; and education records. While the records of industrial and reformatory schools are, for the most part, maintained by the Department of Education, records relating to one industrial school held by the HSE also transferred to Tusla on establishment.</p><p>Tusla has advised that it has recently appointed a National Records Manager and is establishing a Records Management Unit. This new unit is tasked with assessing the feasibility, dependencies and budgetary requirements in relation to the outstanding elements of the relevant actions in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan. Tusla will complete a paper on the outcome of this work in 2021 to inform the decision-making process in relation to advancing these actions. </p><p>Individuals who were previously in care can seek access to their personal records from Tusla either under Freedom of Ireland (FOI) or Data Protection legislation. Guidance around how to submit FOI and Subject Access Requests is available on the Tusla website as follows: </p><p>Tusla Freedom of Information Request Guide: </p><p>Tusla Data Subject Records Request Portal: </p><p>Separately, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has recently committed to working to establish, on a formal, national basis an archive of records related to institutional trauma during the 20<sup>th</sup>century. The National Archive will include historical institutional records. It will be designed in cooperation with professional archivists and historians, as well as with victims, survivors and their advocates.

Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it.</p><p>The Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures. These include awareness raising, providing for mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain categories of persons and improving safeguarding arrangements in organisations providing services to children. The Act operates alongside the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017, which sets out how all reasonable concerns about a child should be reported to Tusla. The Act recognises that a child&rsquo;s welfare includes their emotional welfare while the Guidance sets out definitions of abuse, including emotional abuse, and signs for its recognition. </p><p>Referrals to Tusla regarding the possible harm to a child from a parent are assessed in line with Tusla&rsquo;s policies, procedures and best practice. Tusla has advised that its child protection and welfare assessment considers any past harm and any future danger to a child as a result of complicating factors in a child's environment. These factors include any parental behaviour that is deemed to have a negative impact on a child resulting in them being seriously harmed, including the behaviours that would indicate emotional abuse. Tusla also considers any strengths and existing safety present for the child in the context of the harm and then works collaboratively with parents, professionals and others to create effective safety for the child into the future.</p><p>However, parental alienation is a very challenging and complex issue. It generally arises in situations of extreme inter-parental conflict, which can result in children withdrawing from one parent without the other parent deliberately directing them to do so, but as a response to the conflict. Mediation can sometimes offer parents an opportunity to work through issues arising. </p><p>Tusla social work staff are supported in their professional and evidence informed assessments by access to an online evidence informed toolkit that provides detailed up-to-date research and recommended interventions on key areas such as attachment, critical analysis and thinking, child development, the impact of abuse, separation and loss and parenting capacity. Tusla also provides all staff with access to an entire research centre  with relevant current research and publications relevant to child protection and welfare practice. In addition to regular professional supervision, this ensures staff are supported in maintaining their expertise in an ongoing and supportive learning environment.</p><p>Tusla works collaboratively with child and adult mental health services, the Courts and other therapeutic services in respect of any relevant matters referred to it, including in relation to necessary interventions to support the safety and wellbeing of a child.  </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. The Family Court Bill will be a key element in the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The Department of Justice has recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group. This Group will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system, in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure, as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. My Department is represented on the Oversight Group.</p></reply>

These measures included;</p><p>- Minimisation of on-site provision with priority given to teaching and learning that can only take place on-site;</p><p>- Onsite provision of teaching and research in laboratories, practical tuition and workshops and for skills-based learning (including in relation to apprenticeship);</p><p>- Limited planned on-site attendance for other priority student and learner cohorts at intervals for specific purposes and with avoidance of congregation as well as small tutorials and elements of first-year orientation / induction which cannot be undertaken on line, so long as these are conducted on a staggered basis to avoid congregation or large on-site attendances;</p><p>- Necessary library attendance where there is advance booking/registration;</p><p>- Continuation of research activities with appropriate mitigating protection;</p><p>- Suspension of on-site social and club activities to limit congregation on and off campus.</p><p>On the request of the acting CMO, these measures were subsequently extended nationwide until the announcement on 19<sup>th</sup>October which moved the country to Level 5 restrictions.  </p><p>The extensive work which has been undertaken to underpin the operation of the higher and further education system has been based on detailed planning and contingencies by higher and further education institutions, ongoing reporting and more recently the development of Outbreaks Protocols, and their implementation and communication to staff, students and learners.  The scope for continuity of practical skills provision at more restrictive levels is afforded on the basis of this strong sectoral engagement, planning and reporting, ensuring ongoing close alignment with the framework.</p><p>In devising and implementing the framework we have been mindful of being as inclusive as possible.  Accordingly all publicly funded higher education, private higher education (through HECA members) and education and training offered through ETBs, including that offered on a contracted basis is comprehended within the Guidance and therefore can take place within the current restrictions .  Given the statutory remit of SOLAS, Safepass and CSCS/QSCS training are comprehended.  Community based education is also in scope. </p><p>Outside of this, there is a diverse continuum of education and training of varying degrees of duration and formality.  Our basis for engagement with such providers across this spectrum of diverse sectors is very limited and it would be a major undertaking on the Department&rsquo;s part to oversee the work required to give the necessary confidence in their processes and their implementation, sufficient to provide confidence in the provision of practical skills at more restrictive levels. However, it is the Department&rsquo;s view that such education and training taking place outside of the sectors outlined above, and to which the Deputy refers, falls within the provisions of general Government advice and the HSA Protocols for Returning to Work.</p></reply>

This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework has been developed as part of the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s commitment to play its part in delivering on the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020.</p>  <p>  The Framework was developed in collaboration with students, mental health and suicide prevention specialists, academics, researchers and institutional staff. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I also secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This overall funding of &euro;5m comes at a time of great urgency in relation to student support and re-opening of our higher education institutions. This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. </p>  <p>  Following on from publication of the Framework, the HEA contacted institutions to progress its implementation and to follow up on the earlier funding allocations. Many institutions are already in process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, we're expecting many more to follow suit over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The HEA has outlined that the funding allocation for counselling services specifically is data driven, taking cognisance of research reports such as the USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the My World 2 report, the AHEAD &ldquo;Learning from Home&rdquo; report, and also reflecting USI&rsquo;s prioritisation of increasing capacity of counselling services and the finally promoting the implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. </p>  <p>  In that way, the funding is intended to have a direct and immediate impact for students in this academic year, and the HEA will be requesting a further more detailed report at the end of the academic year which should clearly indicate the metrics used by institutions to measure impact and demonstrate outcomes including in respect of the capacity of counselling services offered by third-level institutions.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling in this current year will allow for development of active outreach to students and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.   </p>  <p>  In October, I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students, Text TCD to 50808. Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required. </p></reply>

This funding will enable institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors, Assistant Psychologists etc.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. </p>  <p>  Following on from publication of the Framework, the HEA contacted institutions to progress its implementation and to follow up on the earlier funding allocations. Many institutions are already in process of increasing their counselling service capacity; there are a number of recruitments of additional counsellors and assistant psychologists live at the moment, we're expecting many more to follow suit over the next few weeks.  This increased capacity/resourcing will allow for development of further active outreach to students.</p>  <p>  The HEA has outlined that the funding allocation for counselling services specifically is data driven, taking cognisance of research reports such as the USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the My World 2 report, the AHEAD &ldquo;Learning from Home&rdquo; report, and also reflecting USI&rsquo;s prioritisation of increasing capacity of counselling services and the finally promoting the implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. </p>  <p>  In that way, the funding is intended to have a direct and immediate impact for students in this academic year, and the HEA will be requesting a further more detailed report at the end of the academic year which should clearly indicate the metrics used by institutions to measure impact and demonstrate outcomes including in respect of the capacity of counselling services offered by third-level institutions.</p>  <p>  The increased capacity/resourcing of counselling in this current year will allow for development of active outreach to students and deliver more support and training to campus staff to identify, support and refer students in difficulty. This whole of campus approach to student support is a central principle in the National Framework for Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention.  While specific services such as counselling provide the specialist response to mental health difficulties, all staff should be aware of how to engage and respond supportively to a student in distress, and how to make effective referrals to the services, and we will be working towards achieving that in line with the framework.   </p>  <p>  In October, I also announced the new keyword partnership with 50808. This is a Free 24/7 anonymous text support service. Students text their institution keyword to 50808 to begin a text conversation e.g. Text DKIT to 50808 for Dundalk IT students, Text TCD to 50808. Although this partnership with student counselling services was in train before the publication of USI National Report on Students and Covid-19, the 50808 partnership responds directly to the almost 27% of students in this report who said they would like to use a text service provided by their college service and 26% who said they would use a text service provided through an external service. 50808 volunteers will also signpost student texters to their campus and local community supports, based on their location, in instances that where further support is required. </p></reply>

It provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 for each new apprentice registered between 1st March 2020 and end June 2021. &euro;2,000 of the grant is paid to the employer once the apprentice is registered, and a further &euro;1,000 is paid after one year if the apprentice is still in employment at that time. </p><p>The impact of Covid-19 on businesses has resulted in a decrease of approximately 24% in new apprentice registrations for the year to end October (from 5,173 in 2019 to 3,952 in 2020).  The introduction of the AIS has supported the recovery of apprentice registrations with September and October showing significant recovery compared to prior months, with October registrations (196) comparable to those of the prior year. </p><p>As of the 18<sup>th</sup>November, 965 claims have been submitted online in respect of 1,667 apprentices.  522 of these claims have been approved in respect of 654 apprentice registrations to a value of &euro;1.308m.

The NTF replaced the pre-existing Apprenticeship Levy which had been in place under The Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Act 1994.

The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 1 December 2020.   </p>  <p>  Yesterday, I secured Cabinet approval to bring forward amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill to provide for two new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </p>  <p>  The first offence will deal with the taking, distribution, publication or threat to distribute intimate images without consent, and with intent to cause harm to the victim. It is intended to carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The second offence will deal with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim. It is intended that this offence will carry a maximum penalty of a &euro;5,000 fine and/or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The amendments proposed also provide that it will be irrelevant that a person may have consented to the taking of an image if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent. It will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.</p>  <p>  Further amendments approved by Cabinet will update harassment legislation to broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover all forms of persistent communications about a person, not just indecent images, and to increase the penalty from seven to ten years to reflect the harm that can be caused by most serious forms of harassment. </p>  <p>  Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society. I am, along with my Government colleagues, fully committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives are underway to address this. </p>  <p>  Progression of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill is a priority action for me as Minister for Justice and I am committed to seeing it enacted as quickly as possible. I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Deputy Brendan Howlin in advancing the proposed amendments and I very much welcome the support expressed by all for this legislation. I look forward to progressing through the legislative process as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The figures for 2020 are for the year to date, up to and including 23<sup>rd</sup>November.  I am informed that there is no specific incident type which can be used to identify all incidents relating to gender-based violence.</p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that combatting Domestic Sexual and Gender Based violence is a key priority for me and my department. In recognition of the importance of the multi- agency approach required to address these matters fully, the draft Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct an audit of statutory responsibilities in this area. I have just published a request for tender for a suitably qualified independent expert to undertake this audit who will, as part of their work, be required to take account of the views of those working at the frontline. The results of this independent audit will provide us with comprehensive analysis to inform how we advance our infrastructure to have the best outcomes in the future. In line with our Programme for Government Commitment, it will be completed by the end of March 2021.</p><p>Without prejudice to the outcome of this audit, the Programme for Government commits to the development of the third National Strategy to be agreed before the end of 2021, which will place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. In partnership with our stakeholders, my Department is currently coordinating a review of the achievements made under the second strategy to help inform the third and we are fully on track to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016 &ndash; 2021 which is a whole-of-Government approach addressing the many actions necessary to address these matters fully.</p><p>The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.</p><p>A range of other relevant actions are being pursued in this area, for example:</p><p>- Giving full effect to the actions contained in Supporting a Victims Journey <i>A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases</i>which is a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the O&rsquo;Malley recommendations</p><p>- my Department has agreed with the Central Statistics Office that it will conduct a major National Sexual Violence Prevalence Study, which will look in detail at women and men experience of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large scale surveys every decade, to provide a robust evidence-basis for Government policy;</p><p>- an independent study on domestic homicide and familicide is being carried out;</p><p>- public awareness campaigns have been organised on domestic abuse (&quot;What would you do?&quot; which ran from 2016-2018) and sexual violence (&quot;No Excuses&quot;, which commenced in 2019 and is scheduled to run until 2021)</p><p>- an expanded Victims Charter has been published and is available on the website www.victimscharter.ie</p><p>- a proactive approach to dealing with incidents of domestic abuse  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through their ongoing Operation Faoimseach which is a proactive initiative designed to ensure that victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected during this unprecedented time. Under this operation domestic abuse victims continue to receive the highest priority by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also continuously improving its specialist services and Divisional Protective Services Units are rolled out nationwide with specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims.</p><p>I would emphasise that implementation of the Second National Strategy is monitored on an ongoing basis and actions may be added to it by agreement of the Monitoring Committee, which as mentioned is made up of representatives from state agencies and the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may also be interested to note that my Department is currently leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned from the inter-agency plan which we put in place to address domestic abuse, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This process includes input from the community and voluntary sector working in this area.  This will strengthen our national response to the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>  </p></reply>

It is important to note that Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance. </p>  <p>  In the first budget of this government, I am pleased that we have secured significant additional funding to start delivering on the commitments we made to people with disabilities in the Programme for Government. Budget 2021 provides for an unprecedented level of investment in disability services, with an investment of &euro;100m for new initiatives in 2021. This will build on the investment already in place, and on the &euro;20 million once off funding being made available in 2020 for disability voluntary service providers engaged in the Transforming Lives Reform programme. Additional funding to support recovery of services in the context of COVID-19 has also been provided this year.  </p>  <p>  The &euro;100 in new funding in 2021 will be targeted at five key areas: children&rsquo;s services, day services, community supports, residential services, and integration.  The HSE are currently finalising their National Service Plan for 2021 and in this context, the HSE have been asked to examine how these key priorities can be progressed in 2021 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.  </p></reply>

All women who have had a termination of pregnancy are entitled to these services, which are provided free of charge in a range of locations across the country.</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; freephone counselling helpline became operational on 1 January 2019. The My Options Information and Counselling service is available from 9am-9pm Monday to Friday as well as Saturday 10am-2pm and is staffed by Counsellors. The telephone nursing service is available 24/7 and is staffed by nurses and midwives. My Options can provide an interpreter for 240 different languages and the &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; leaflet has been translated into six languages.</p><p>In addition to other support services available, the HSE published the <i>National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death</i>in 2016.  The purpose of the standards is to enhance bereavement care services for parents who experience a pregnancy loss or perinatal death.  These standards cover all pregnancy loss situations from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death, as well as situations where there is a diagnosis of foetal anomaly that will be life limiting or may be fatal. </p><p>Since then, Bereavement Specialist Teams have been established in all 19 maternity hospitals/units across the country, to assist and support parents, families and professionals dealing with pregnancy loss. The teams are supported in their work by staff including social workers, palliative care teams and chaplains. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the National Standards, a national website is available for use as a resource specifically for parents bereaved through pregnancy loss and perinatal death, and the healthcare professionals who care for them.

The restructuring of services, social distancing measures and self-isolation can be particularly difficult for those who are trying to remain drug or alcohol free and for those who are in recovery.</p>  <p>  The Government plan for living with Covid-19 details how non-Covid health and social care services will be resumed, especially during the challenging winter months. This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p>  <p>  The Department has set up a working group with drug and alcohol service providers to develop a 'Framework for the Restoration of Drug and Alcohol Services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. The working group has identified issues on which guidance and supports are required. I expect to be in receipt of the finished Framework document in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss continued support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs.  On 13th November, I announced the provision of &euro;480,000 in once-off funding to support the restoration of drug and alcohol services during Covid-19. This &euro;480,000 is being provided to the network of 24 Drug and Alcohol Task Forces for distribution to community and voluntary drug and alcohol services in their areas. Each task force will receive up to &euro;20,000 in once-off funding to meet Covid-19 related costs.</p>  <p>   As this is also a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This 5 level Framework reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. </p><p>Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  </p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.

It provides residential care for up to 60 residents and approximately 120 day care places per week. All service users have a diagnosis of dementia. The majority of the residential places receive funding support through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS). Separately, the HSE contracts for approximately 25 Day Care places per day at St Joseph&rsquo;s. </p>  <p>  The NHSS, commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated by the Minister for Health pursuant to Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. </p>  <p>  As part of this function, the NTPF will enter into "Approved Nursing Home Agreements" with registered private and voluntary nursing homes to record the maximum price(s) that have been negotiated. It will be appreciated that particulars of all such negotiations and reviews are a matter between the nursing home and the NTPF. Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes.  </p>  <p>  The NTPF has statutory independence and as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, I have no role in NHSS price negotiations. I understand however, that engagement through the established mechanisms has occurred.</p>  <p>  You will be aware that a wide range of financial and non-financial supports related to COVID-19 have been made available to the private and voluntary nursing home sector. Among other supports, this includes the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme for Nursing Homes, now extended to June 2021, and the ongoing provision of PPE. I encourage St Joseph's to ensure that it is availing of all relevant supports during this time.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the nursing home sector especially during these unprecedented times and officials and I meet regularly to discuss a range of matters with sector representatives.</p></reply>

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The HSE has however a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department and has been published. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. </p>  <p>  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised a work programme which has been initiated and which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment. This will include an examination within the next 12 weeks of potential options on a legislative framework to extend eligibility in such cases. In parallel to the legislative work, officials will also consider proposals that would enable those with a terminal illness to access services without necessarily requiring a medical card.</p></reply>

There will be delays associated with the requirement to cease works on the site of the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital due to Covid-19 restrictions. As of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was of the view that the Main Contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.   </p>  <p>  The current overall capital build cost of the project is &euro;1,433bn.  This includes all of the capital cost for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two Outpatient Department and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght Hospital campuses, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces.  The &euro; 1.43bn figure on capital cost as set out above does not take account of the impact of COVID on the construction sector, including the NCH. </p>  <p>  In addition to the capital project there is a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development. The inclusion of these elements alongside the capital build account for a total overall project cost of &euro;1.73 billion. </p>  <p>  The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of further cost.  </p>  <p>  The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the Main Contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments. Any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could potentially be a matter for dispute resolution and it is not possible at this stage to forecast the cost implications as the position continues to unfold. At this point it is still too early to fully assess the time or costs impact of the pandemic on the project.</p>  <p>  The NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital. There are Governance structures in place to oversee and monitor progress on the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Project and Programme. These include the Children's Hospital Project and Programme Board, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Project and Programme Steering Group, chaired by the Deputy Director General of the Health Service Executive. The Steering Group directs the overall programme of work within agreed parameters, and reports to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Project and Programme Board.</p></reply>

This is particularly important as we deal with the challenges presented by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Trade missions have become an integral part of this strategy, and the selection of the destination of each mission is agreed following consideration of a number of factors, including Bord Bia's market prioritisation analysis. The latter exercise has already assisted in the selection of Japan as a destination for two very successful trade missions. </p>  <p>  Of course, our traditional in-person method of developing trade with customers is not feasible currently. To that end, my Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, is holding a series of Virtual Trade Missions on five dates spanning November and December with customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. These interactive engagements will include Irish exporters and existing and potential overseas customers. Also in November, a series of virtual meetings has been held with key international customers in various countries, including customers from Japan and the UAE.</p>  <p>  At the moment, I do not have any immediate plans to lead trade missions to Japan or the UAE. However,  I can confirm that officials from my Department, in consultation with Bord Bia, are finalising my trade mission programme for 2021.</p></reply>

My Department is providing additional vital supports to rural and community organisations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:</p>  <p>  On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations. These initiatives provide support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for their crisis telephone support line, and an email helpdesk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries. </p>  <p>  On 11 May 2020, a &euro;40 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and is administered by the Department. This funding is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society.</p>  <p>  The package included:</p>  <p>- A &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund providing a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis. An additional &euro;10M was allocated to this fund as part of the Budget 2021 process and my Department is currently finalising the distribution of this additional funding. To date 590 organisations including many charities have been allocated almost &euro;31M under this fund; and</p>  <p>- A &euro;5 million Government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which focuses on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges. To date, 52 organisations have been allocated a funding value of approximately &euro;3.2 million. A second round of applications are currently being assessed and it is anticipated that the successful awardees will be announced in early December</p>  <p>  On 9 April 2020, an initial &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that are participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which is being led by the Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme (CSP) to provide local services through a social enterprise model.  As a result of COVID-19 my Department also developed a &euro;1.2m Support Fund to assist all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, during this crisis period. The Fund provided additional funding for a number of weeks to many of these organisations. Pobal, who manage the programme on behalf of the Department, have undertaken a detailed review of the financial position of all the CSP supported organisations, as their ability to generate income has been greatly hampered by the Covid-19 crisis in many cases.  The outcome of this review will inform decision regarding any additional supports that might be required by these organisations.  The Department should be in a position to make an announcement on this matter very shortly and any additional supports to be provided will be considered in light of available resources.</p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small scale infrastructure projects in rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.  In 2020, the supports provided through CL&Aacute;R have been tailored to help rural communities respond to the new COVID-19 environment, including the new Meals on Wheels and Linked Services measure. This measure provides funding to community organisations for the purchase of kitchen or food delivery equipment and vehicle adaptations that may be necessary as a result of new public health advice.  Funding of almost &euro;340,000 was announced for 45 successful projects on Friday, November 20th.</p>  <p>  The Department worked with Pobal to put in place guidance for community and voluntary groups regarding reopening after the initial lockdown.  This guidance is updated regularly by the Department as the situation develops, and is now focussed on operating safely.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when safe to do so.</p></reply>

The call document provided examples of potential social consideration clauses that could be applied such as, reserved lots for social enterprises, or dedicated/weighted marks for social enterprise applicants. </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding at a standard rate of 75% of total eligible costs incurred but the rate increased to 80% for library authorities who included a social consideration clause in their procurement process. </p>  <p>  In response to the call, the Department received applications for 49 projects from 30 library authorities, all of which were approved, and six of the projects submitted by four library authorities (Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan x2, Westmeath x 2) included a social consideration clause.</p>  <p>  Pobal, which works on behalf of Government is an agency under the aegis of my Department.  It uses standard Office of Government Procurement contract templates. A key element in Pobal&rsquo;s procurement strategy is to engage in socially responsible public procurement. </p>  <p>  In September 2020, Pobal issued a new internal Procurement Policy with a &ldquo;think social first&rdquo; strategy whereby Pobal will ask if services or goods can be provided by a social enterprise or workshop. Also in 2021, Pobal&rsquo;s new three-year Corporate Procurement Plan will set out target contracts that Pobal will aim for with regard to social enterprises to tender for. </p></reply>
