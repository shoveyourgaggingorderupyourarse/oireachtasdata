This is an important legislative requirement.</p>  <p>  Continued operation of a service is contingent on registration with Tusla's Early Years Inspectorate which operates as the statutory regulator for the sector. Tusla monitors compliance with the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 through the registration process and through inspections of services. Any breach of the Child Care Act 1991, or of the Regulations, is taken very seriously by my Department and by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Where a service meets the requirements for registration but refuses to cooperate with this process, for example by operating as an unregistered pre-school service, the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate may escalate the matter to the District Court. It is Tusla's policy to seek closure of all unregistered services,  and if engagement is not forthcoming from the provider of these services, Tusla will bring the matter before the courts. </p>  <p>  The courts have a range of powers under the Child Care Act, including the power to impose fines and to prohibit an individual from providing an early years service. These are generic sanctions allowed for under the Act and are not specific to any particular case. </p>  <p>  In February 2019, I signed the School Age Childcare regulations. These allow, for the first time, for the registration of school age childcare services in Ireland. Childcare services already registered with Tusla under the early years regulations have until August 18th to register their school age service. Stand-alone school age childcare services must register with Tusla before May 18. These regulations will be followed by more comprehensive regulations after a further period of consultation.</p></reply>

In order to address this my Department undertook, along with the Education and Training Boards, a mapping exercise with Pobal of all youth service provision in the country in 2017. </p>  <p>  This year, the Education and Training Boards are building on the knowledge gained in 2017 by carrying out a full area profile, needs assessment and service requirement for each of their areas.  This process is to help the ETBs identify the specific needs of young people in their areas and the services required to meet those needs. </p>  <p>  Ten of the ETBs will be focussing on already existing youth service provision in this exercise.  The remaining six ETBs, including Louth Meath ETB, have been asked to also identify, through this exercise, areas where new service development is required.  This is because these 6 ETBs have had no recent new youth services established in their areas.</p>  <p>  I expect this to be completed by the end of May.  My Department is committed to working with Louth Meath Education and Training Board to explore ways to address emerging needs.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country.  This includes those from disadvantaged communities.  The  youth funding provided by my Department was &euro;58.9m in 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provided an additional &euro;1.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services which will be used, primarily, for programmes that target disadvantaged young people.  This will include investing in new service provision where need is proven.  I have asked for a sum of &euro;30k to be set aside for each of the six ETBs, including Louth Meath ETB. This will support the cost of a quarter year of a youth service provision.  </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising the 2019 funding allocations for the youth projects and youth services throughout the country. Every effort is being made to complete this process as soon as possible and allocations will be notified to projects in the near future. </p>  <p>  The funding allocation for the targeted youth projects and services in County Meath amounted to &euro;152,854 in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  In 2019, I provided an additional 12% in overall funding for this scheme, bringing the total allocation to over &euro;2m.  This includes an allocation of &euro;131,735 for Louth Meath Education and Training Board.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising details for a Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme for voluntary clubs/groups and a small capital scheme for staff led youth services to be launched in 2019.  The full details of the application criteria for these schemes and the funding allocation provided to Louth Meath ETB will be announced in the near future.</p></reply>

In this regard my Department has collaborated with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in agreeing a comprehensive set of actions under the 5 Year Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022.</p>  <p>  These actions are in support of the overarching 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and are designed to affirm the importance that early learning and care settings have in encouraging the development and revitalisation of the Irish language.  </p>  <p>  The aim of these actions is to build on the existing measures, supports and partnerships in place in the area of Irish-medium early learning and care, and to further improve these supports and services. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, First 5, the recently published ten year Whole-of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families contains two actions specifically related to the provision of Irish language supports to the early learning and care sector.  </p>  <p>  My Department funds some 228 services which identify themselves as Na&iacute;onra&iacute;.  Total funding of some &euro;16m was provided to such services over the past four years.</p>  <p>  Much is currently being done in my Department to ensure improved communication with Irish speaking childcare services. For example, in respect of the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme, the website and parent application will be available in Irish. Irish speaking support staff will be available to answer parental queries, and communications in relation to the Scheme will also be available in Irish. </p>  <p>  Training and materials for the Access and Inclusion Model that helps children with a disability to participate in the ECCE scheme are available through Irish.  Inspections operated by Tusla and the Department of Education are available through Irish, as are mentoring services from Better Start. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to continuing to support services wishing to operate through the medium of Irish. </p></reply>

I have secured a budget of over &euro;786 million for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which includes funding for the recruitment of more social workers and support staff for Tusla. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that all referrals are screened when they are received.  All urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. Other cases are referred to family support services or dealt with by child protection teams, as needed.</p>  <p>  Once a referral has been screened, Tusla social work staff carry out a preliminary enquiry to determine the best course of action. The preliminary enquiry looks at all relevant information, and a decision is made on whether an immediate protective response is needed.</p>  <p>  Tusla's goal is to complete all preliminary enquiries inside five days, and data on this metric is published on a quarterly basis.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of cases awaiting allocation to a dedicated social worker. These cases are given appropriate attention by the duty team, which can include  checking with professionals who see the child regularly, or visiting the child and family at home, getting additional information about the child's situation and in some instances, where a child is in care, organising a Care Plan Review and visiting the child.</p>  <p>  One of the key challenges for Tusla in carrying out this important work is recruiting social work staff with the appropriate experience and qualifications. I can advise the Deputy that my officials are working with Tusla, and with the relevant educational bodies, to develop ways of increasing the number of training posts for social workers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-28a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800057#WRA02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 21 and 38 together.</p>  <p>  Assisting families to access high quality, affordable early learning and care and school age childcare is a priority for me as Minister and hence I take the issues raised by colleagues and services very seriously.</p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes and I want to see investment in this area continue to increase significantly over the coming years. I am delighted that First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families commits to doubling investment over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  Given the large amount of public money invested in these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. I believe that my Department's approach to protecting Exchequer funding and ensuring compliance, is balanced appropriately with supports we provide to services to enable them continue to deliver a sustainable and high quality service.</p>  <p>  Pobal, as administrator of my Department's funded childcare programmes, conducts compliance visits to childcare service providers. These visits check a service&rsquo;s compliance with the published rules of Exchequer funded programmes.</p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show a significant level of non-compliance. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  In particular many childcare services have been found to be in breach of programme rules concerning attendance records and registrations. This issue has been particularly acute among services offering the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS).</p>  <p>  Non-compliance, like the type we have seen in CCS, represents a risk to Exchequer funds as it can lead to services receiving funding in excess of their entitlement. For this reason, my Department, working with Pobal, identify incorrect registrations and apply the relevant corrections to ensure that services are receiving the correct level of funding. </p>  <p>  The level of overclaim identified varies for each service and may impact some services more than others. Pobal has been working with services to explain the financial impacts and manage the overclaims recovery process. </p>  <p>  I recognise fully the challenges that can be faced by community services where incorrect registrations have been discovered. That is why my Department has developed a strong Case Management system, operated by Pobal, through which a dedicated team assists services facing challenges.</p>  <p>  This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Where financial difficulties or sustainability issues arise however, a budget I have created to assist with these challenges can then be tapped into to assist services transition, in a manageable way, towards sustainability.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged that the majority of services have engaged constructively with the process so far and a way forward has been found. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises. Again, I want to stress that expert assistance, and financial support is available to services who need it.</p>  <p>  The existing or legacy targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). The NCS was developed based on evidence of the best interests of children and families. Its attendance rules will reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. My Department has engaged with service providers on the development of the NCS and continues to do so.</p>  <p>  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.</p>  <p>  At the same time, rules will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p>  <p>  My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how the NCS will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.  </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment.</p>  <p>  Turnover for many services has increased substantially due to the fact that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families that I published last November. </p></reply>

They deserve to be valued and respected for this.</p>  <p>  My Department funds a wide range of initiatives to support the quality, affordability and accessibility of early learning and care. However the State is not the employer of staff and cannot therefore set wage levels.</p>  <p>  Instead, I have actively supported a range of measures to improve pay and conditions. These include the 117% increase in investment since 2016 that has enabled services to operate at optimal capacity; the 7% ECCE capitation increase for providers last September and the introduction of Programme Support Payments to providers, which this year amount to &euro;21.4m.</p>  <p>  The average wage in the sector rose from &euro;11.93 per hour in 2017 to &euro;12.17 per hour in 2018, but there is a very long way to go before staff have the wages and working conditions that reflect the importance of the work they do, particularly now with 22% of the workforce being graduates.</p>  <p>  Services are experiencing difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified staff, mostly I understand due to poor terms and conditions and partly because of the major growth in the sector that has happened in recent years. </p>  <p>  Pobal data shows that 130,000 children were attending services in 2014 but this grew to 230,000 in 2018. While the staff turnover rate fell from 28% in 2017, to 24% in 2018, the rate is still too high.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor my officials can initiate a Sectoral Employment Order, but my Department is ready to input to such a process, if and when the sector seeks it.</p></reply>

These children are thus more likely to enter the criminal justice system and serve periods of detention. This can have profound negative impacts on their emotional and physical well-being as well as affecting the opportunities available to them as adults. </p>  <p>  My Department commissioned further research under a partnership project with the University of Limerick. Funding of &euro;1.2 million (&euro;450,000 in 2018 and &euro;750,000 in 2019) was allocated under the Dormant Accounts Act, 2012. It facilitates the expansion of the research begun with the Greentown Study. It is intended to replicate this study in two other towns. Additionally, a national survey will be conducted to indicate how widespread the Greentown findings are. This will culminate in an expert-led intervention programme to be trialled next year.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that, through this research, we will be in a position to make robust interventions available to motivate and assist vulnerable children in danger of criminal influence and their families.</p></reply>

Open cases are allocated to a social worker and assigned a priority level: high, medium or low. At the end of December, there were a total of 1,003 High Priority open cases, 3,296 at Medium Priority and 2,133 Low Priority awaiting allocation to a social worker. </p>  <p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that high priority does not necessarily mean high risk, and that all urgent or high risk cases receive immediate attention. Identified cases that have not yet been allocated receive support and a service from Tusla's duty teams.</p>  <p>  The transition to a single national agency responsible for the welfare and protection of children has not always been easy and work remains to be done. Challenges are ongoing in respect of the recruitment and retention of staff, the integration of key services for children and families and the vital cross agency working that allows for quick and effective responses to all the situations referred to or dealt with by Tusla. The development of a national child care information system, the NCCIS, will support social workers in the work and provide a more effective protective service.  I am confident that Tusla is fully dedicated to meeting those challenges, and to continue to improve the service they deliver to the most vulnerable young people in our society.</p></reply>

Following the conclusion of the criminal case and sentencing of the perpetrator, the Review was resumed and has now been completed. It has been highlighted by Tusla that not all of the young people involved have chosen to waive their statutory right to anonymity.  Tusla must not infringe on this statutory protection.</p>  <p>  It is important to be mindful that a number of the young people involved in this case may be extremely vulnerable.

It is also our responsibility to bear in mind the significant if unintended impact this could have on the young people at the centre of the case.

The scheme will open to applications this October, with payments flowing from November.</p><p>As previously noted to the House, the provision of a timeline for the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme has always been dependent on having the necessary legal and ICT infrastructure in place.  Good progress is currently being made in this regard.</p><p>Last July, the primary legislation establishing the Scheme, the Childcare Support Act, was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines made under the Act are now being finalised.  </p><p>Last July, I also awarded a contract for the development of the Scheme's supporting IT system.  The contractor, Codec, is currently working intensively with officials from my Department and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system so that it will be available on schedule in October. </p><p>In December, I signed regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services with Tusla, and these regulations came into force on the 18<sup>th</sup>of February. This means that school age childcare services will be able to participate in the scheme from the outset. </p><p>A national communications campaign on the Scheme is also underway.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports, to allow everyone- parents, providers and representative groups- to prepare for the Scheme.  Key elements of the campaign in March included the launch of a new website- - as well as a major nationwide training programme for providers, offering over 12,500 training places across 600 venues.  I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in both the website and the training. </p><p>In September and October, my Department will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness amongst parents of their potential entitlements under the new Scheme.</p><p>In the interim, in order to fast-track many of the benefits of the National Childcare Scheme, and to ensure all Government investment was being fully utilised, in September 2017 I announced a series of enhancements to the existing targeted childcare subsidy schemes.  These enhancements involved a new universal subsidy for children under 3 years and increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates.  The interim measures exceeded our target and benefitted 84,000 children in the programme year September 2017- August 2018. These measures remain in place for the 2018 /2019 programme year and continue to experience high demand.</p><p>As stated above, the National Childcare Scheme is due to go live this October. As part of Budget 2019, I was pleased to have been able to further enhance the Scheme by raising the upper and lower thresholds for income related subsidies.  These increases will poverty-proof the scheme for families on lower incomes, and enable more families with middle and higher incomes to access support. </p><p>I continue to work intensively with my officials to deliver this landmark scheme which will alter the landscape of early learning and care and school age childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. </p><p>In parallel with this work, I will continue to support providers with regard to increased provision of early learning and care and school age childcare places. In 2019, I have secured a capital budget of &euro;9.606m for the sector which will enable a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. </p><p>I am also very pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan ( 2018-2027) and to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for early learning and care and school age childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.</p><p>This capital investment will be essential, I believe, to respond to the increased demand we expect as the National Childcare Scheme is introduced. Research is on-going in my Department to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. </p><p>Finally, many families and children opt for home-based rather than centre-based early learning and care and school age childcare. Continued access to childminding services is important. I will soon publish a Childminding Action Plan which will set out short, medium and long term objectives to regulate childminding in this country, hence enabling a larger volume of childminders access the NCS over time. This action plan will also set out the supports required to enable childminders meet the regulatory requirements that will be developed over an extended period. </p></reply>

Childcare providers may charge for optional extras, but where a parent/guardian does not choose any of the optional extras, their child must be provided with the full ECCE service provision. Each optional extra must be identified individually on the fees list. Services cannot prioritise ECCE places on the basis of uptake of optional extras.</p><p>There is one exception to this rule pertaining to services who offer 'sessional only' (up to 3.5 hours childcare provision per day), as stated below. </p><p><b>2.4.9Additional 30 minutes in sessional service </b></p><p>A sessional service provider may offer an additional 30 minutes per day but this must be categorised as an optional extra. Therefore the parent can choose to opt for paying for an extra half hour or equally, choose not to. </p><p>However, as per the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme grant funding agreement, part-time and full-time services may prioritise places for children who wish to avail of extra hours over those availing of the ECCE Programme only, on the principle that Early Learning and Care services are private enterprises and are therefore free to set their own admission policies which can include prioritising part- time or full-time places. </p><p>Parents who cannot access a free ECCE service are encouraged to look around for an alternative service that is in a position to offer it. Their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) should be able to assist them, or advise if there is no local alternative.  The website can help parents locate their CCC. The City and County Childcare Committees in turn keep my Department advised on capacity issues and whether parental preferences are being met.</p></reply>

These are available on a national basis through thousands of registered providers across all counties, including Wexford. They include:</p><p>-  The universal pre-school programme, which provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.</p><p>-The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and the targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS), which provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by providers. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</p><p>-  The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by providers for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work who need school-age childcare.</p><p>-  Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.</p><p>Radical reforms to the targeted schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced this October, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. </p><p>Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy towards the cost of Early Learning and Care. This stands at &euro;1,040 per annum currently for a child under 3 in full time registered Early Learning and Care. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided, with the level of subsidy determined by net household income and the age of the child (children). Households with a net income of less than &euro;26,000 will receive the maximum subsidy. This can be as high as &euro;5.10 per hour, available for up to 40 hours per week, for a child under one. Households with net income up to &euro;60,000 will also benefit, but on a sliding scale from the maximum subsidy level available for incomes under &euro;26,000. Further information is available at . </p><p>In addition to these universal and targeted subsidies, the NCS allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements. </p><p>Recent analysis undertaken by the OECD has concluded that, when the NCS is introduced, the costs of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to parents will come closer to the OECD average &ndash; from being one of the highest across the OECD.  For example, we will move from being the most expensive country in the OECD for lone parents to 11th position ( this research was conducted before Budget 2019 which increased investment by a further &euro;89m). This demonstrates significant progress. The NCS, in creating a flexible platform for future investment in funding, will allow subsidies to be expanded over time and importantly further progress to be made.</p></reply>

The scheme will open to applications this October, with payments flowing from November.</p><p>Good progress is currently being made in preparing for the Scheme's launch.</p><p>Last July, the primary legislation establishing the Scheme, the Childcare Support Act, was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines made under the Act are now being finalised.  </p><p>Last July, I also awarded a contract for the development of the Scheme's supporting IT system.  The contractor, Codec, is currently working intensively with officials from my Department and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system so that it will be available on schedule in October. </p><p>In December, I signed regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services with Tusla, and these regulations came into force on the 18<sup>th</sup>of February. This means that school age childcare services will be able to participate in the scheme from the outset. </p><p>A national communications campaign on the Scheme is also underway.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports, to allow everyone- parents, providers and representative groups- to prepare for the Scheme.  Key elements of the campaign in March included the launch of a new website- - as well as a major nationwide training programme for providers, offering over 12,500 training places across 600 venues.  I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in both the website and the training. </p><p>In September and October, my Department will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness amongst parents of their potential entitlements under the new Scheme.</p><p>Under measures included in Budget 2019, I was pleased to have been able to further enhance the Scheme by raising the upper and lower thresholds for income related subsidies.  These increases will poverty-proof the scheme for families on lower incomes, and enable more families with middle and higher incomes to access support. </p><p>I will continue to work intensively to deliver this landmark scheme which will alter the landscape of childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. </p><p>In parallel with this work, I will continue to support providers with regard to increased provision of childcare places. In 2019, I have secured a Capital budget of &euro;9.606m for the sector which will enable a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. </p><p>I am also very pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan ( 2018-2027) and to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the earlier National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.  This investment will be essential, I believe, to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new National Childcare Scheme is introduced.  </p></reply>

It must be remembered that the different areas, although all in the HSE, had continued in reality to operate different practices and policies, reflecting their different health board origins.  Tusla's task was to reform the 17 areas into  a single organisation with new management structures, bring together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, (the HSE, the Family support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board)  develop  national operational policies and realign the new organisation to current need. All of this had to occur while providing the ongoing complex business of child protection services in the face of  increasing referrals. </p>  <p>  Tusla has been engaged in a programme of reform  which involves the standardisation of business processes, the development of quality assurance mechanisms and improved data system to reflect service demand, outputs and outcomes.  A National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) was rolled out to all 17 Tusla areas in July 2017.  The NCCIS is producing high quality data and making child protection services more effective. Tusla has also implemented a national model for child protection, Signs of Safety, and, through its own auditing work, identifies practices that need improvement.  Tusla now has common definitions and thresholds for child protection cases,  which, for the first time, provide a true picture of children's need in our country. Knowing where the problems lie is an essential step in delivering improvements. </p>  <p>  A major issue for the organisation since its establishment has been achieving a sufficient number of social workers to meet the ongoing rise in referrals for child protection and child welfare services.  Tusla are finalising a Workforce Strategy to focus on future need to ensure they are in a position to address their statutory work. </p>  <p>  HIQA have rightly identified issues in relation to retrospective cases and safety planning that need to be addressed in their Statutory Investigation published last summer. I established an Expert Advisory Group to advise me and the Board of Tusla on the progress that was being made in implementing actions.  I met with the Chairperson of the EAG, Dr Moling Ryan, on Monday last and he provided me with a report identifying progress and areas needing further prioritising.  </p>  <p>  My officials are currently working with the education sector, including the five Universities and one Institute of Technology involved in qualifying social workers. The purpose of the work is to increase the  future provision of social workers. </p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks about the number of child protection and welfare referrals that have yet to be assessed.  At the end of December 2018, over 6,000 cases were unallocated, representing 23% of all cases. All  high-risk or urgent referrals do receive an immediate service and urgent response. Tusla has identified 5 of the 17 areas  that between them hold the majority of unallocated cases. I have asked Tusla to make a presentation to me on the special measures it is putting in place in these areas to manage this worrying situation. </p></reply>

We take these reports very seriously and have raised our concerns with our Chinese counterparts, in bilateral and multilateral contexts, and as an EU Member State.</p>  <p>  The subject of human rights were raised and discussed during political consultations held with China in November 2018, including our concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang. </p>  <p>  Ireland participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), also held last November. The UPR is the mechanism through which the United Nations Human Rights Council examines and addresses the human rights performance of its member states. In our intervention, in addition to expressing concern at reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs, in particular their detention in political re-education camps, we urged China to respect freedom of religion and belief and recommended that China grant access to the OHCHR to all regions of the country including Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The EU also continues to raise concerns regarding freedom of religion and belief on several occasions at bilateral and multilateral levels. During the last EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in July 2018, the restrictions on the Uighur and other Muslim minority populations were discussed. The next Human Rights Dialogue is expected to take place in early April.</p>  <p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019, the EU raised concerns about the existence of political re-education camps and widespread surveillance and restrictions particularly targeted at Uighurs in Xinjiang, and urged China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland fully supports the EU position, and actively contributes to its actions and statements.</p>  <p>  Through our ongoing contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing, Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang with the Chinese authorities, along with our EU partners and other like-minded Member States.</p></reply>

In advance of the fourth and most recent session in October 2018, Ecuador circulated the zero draft of a legally binding instrument.  The next session of the Group will meet in October 2019 and Ireland will work with our EU partners to look at how we might actively and constructively engage in the negotiation process, notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date.  While we are open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty, we believe that all economic operators should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. The draft treaty that has currently been circulated focuses on transnational corporations and it is Ireland's view that any new treaty should cover both companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.</p>  <p>  We would wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point, I would note that of the 21 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.   </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. </p></reply>

I am not in a position to comment on individual cases, and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the pricing or provision of insurance products, as these are matters of a commercial nature, and determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.    </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016 that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  This Working Group, now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., has undertaken an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  </p>  <p>  Following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last week and shows that 24 out of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been accomplished.  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy is confident that the two outstanding actions will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:</p>  <p>  - The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na </p>  <p>  - The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its Fifth Programme of Law Reform and is being given immediate attention=</p>  <p>  - Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system</p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses, such as those in the hospitality sector, and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-28a.132.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800059#WRC04800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 to 58, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The majority of hire purchase agreements, such as PCPs, are provided to consumers through credit intermediaries. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, credit intermediaries are authorised by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and when performing intermediary functions credit intermediaries are required to disclose certain information in writing to the consumer including the nature of the financial accommodation and details on the amount, number and frequency of payments, the total amount the consumer would have to pay under the agreement and, where applicable, the APR. </p>  <p>  While intermediaries are frequently involved in the process, hire purchase agreements are ultimately provided by hire purchase providers and these providers are the entity which is the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the good let to the consumer under the hire purchase agreement.  While hire-purchase providers themselves are not required to obtain a specific authorisation from the Central Bank (or the CCPC) for the provision of hire-purchase agreements, nevertheless this is an activity which is subject to statutory control and which contains important consumer protections.  For example, Parts II and VI of the Consumer Credit Act provide that important information be disclosed in advertisements for hire purchase agreements and also in such agreements as entered into by consumers.  This includes information on the cash price of the good, as well as the APR and hire purchase price. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the regulatory framework governing the provision of PCP and hire purchase agreements is kept under review to ensure that the level of consumer protection continues to be robust. Following reports on the PCP market by the CCPC and the Central Bank, last summer I asked Mr. Michael Tutty to conduct a review of the PCP market and regulatory structure and his report was subsequently published by my Department last November.  That report found that there was currently no evidence of consumer detriment arising from PCPs but nevertheless it set out a number of recommendations to help avoid possible problems arising in the future. The CCPC and Tutty Reports suggested that it would be desirable to ensure that certain provisions of the Consumer Protection Code (CPC) , in particular the relevant provisions on &ldquo;knowing the consumer and suitability&rdquo; should be applicable to PCP and hire purchase agreements and that the appropriate legal means of doing so should be investigated further. I have previously indicated that I broadly accept the recommendations and conclusions of the Tutty report and my Department is currently consulting the Office of the Attorney General on some specific issues raised in the report (including those in relation to the CPC). When a response is to hand, my Department will further engage with the Central Bank, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the CCPC on this matter. Also, in relation to the requirement to check the financial position of the consumer before he/she may enter into a PCP or hire purchase agreement, as the Deputy will be aware the Markets in Financial Instruments Act 2018 now provides that hire purchase and similar type agreements now fall within the scope of the Central Credit Register. </p>  <p>  It is also important to enhance the level of public awareness of PCP products and to provide information in relation to financial services more generally, including information in relation to the costs to consumers and the risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services. In this context the CCPC has conducted several awareness campaigns in relation to PCP car finance in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and I am advised that it is developing a further campaign for 2019. I am informed that part of the CCPC&rsquo;s information campaigns relates to the implications of a poor credit rating on future financial requirements. </p></reply>

The day to day supervision of insurance undertakings is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, and so I have consulted with it in respect of the information sought. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that there are currently 139 UK and 26 Gibraltar authorised insurance undertakings with freedom of service notifications into Ireland.  However, they note that not all undertakings with passporting notifications write business in Ireland.  In this regard, they advise that 64 UK insurance undertakings and 17 Gibraltar insurance undertakings currently have Irish policyholders.  Of these 81 undertakings, 12 undertakings to date, have not established a presence and sought authorisation in Ireland or another EU country.  I do not have information on the number of policyholders in those undertakings.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectations, I am informed that the Central Bank has engaged with insurers and brokers on Brexit, and that it has instructed them to take appropriate contingency measures to ensure the continuity of services for cross-border insurance policies between the UK and other Member States of the EU; inform existing and new customers and beneficiaries of the implications of these contingency measures and provide customers with clear information on the contingency measures taken or planned and how they might affect policies.  I understand also that the Central Bank is also working closely with UK and European regulators to exchange information about firms&rsquo; plans and actions needed to address any consumer protection concerns.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that my Department and the Central Bank are working closely to protect customers of insurance products in event of a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit.   In that regard, provisions in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 allow for a temporary run-off regime, which will allow certain UK and Gibraltar insurers and brokers to continue to service existing insurance contracts with Irish policyholders in the event of a &ldquo;no deal&rsquo;&rsquo; Brexit.</p></reply>

Currently, the only public information available in relation to awards are those settled by PIAB, and those awarded in Court. However what percentage these settlement channels make up of overall award levels, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was not able to establish.  In its report on the cost of motor insurance, the CIWG indicated as follows &ldquo;Claims details in relation to direct settlements between insurers and claimants are not publically available. Some commentators estimate that direct settlement comprise 60%-70% of all cases thus this represents a significant data gap&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Consequently, the CIWG recommended that such information be collected as part of the National Claims Information Database.  One of the key purposes of collecting claims data by settlement channels is to give greater insight into how costs and awards differ depending on the method of settlement.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database.  Section 4 of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 sets out the different settlement channels through which a claim may be finalised.  The breakdown of the various channels in the Section was identified as important to allow policymakers to see trends or distinctions in the costs related to these channels and to enable them develop more targeted response measures where necessary.  This information is expected to include motor insurance claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.   </p>  <p>  The Act was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The required consultation by the Central Bank with regard to the publication of the relevant regulations to outline the scope of the Database took place in mid-March and I understand that the Bank is finalising arrangements to publish these regulations.  The Central Bank plans to collect motor claims data from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of the year.  The Central Bank will also as the Deputy is aware consider the feasibility of expanding the scope of the database to cover employer/public liability later this year. </p>  <p>  To conclude, I believe that increasing transparency in and around the settlement channels is a key part of claims information, and having this information will allow policymakers have a better understanding of the way the market is evolving and thus enable them better identify and take action to address  trends in the market.</p></reply>

As part of the review, the Department examined a number of possible approaches including approaches in other jurisdictions. This work included examination of an insurance pool option which would involve setting up an insurance pool financed by an agreed percentage of insurance premiums being paid into it similar to Flood Re in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  The first point to note is that the Flood Re model is basically an insurance scheme underwritten and administered by the industry which the UK Government helped establish. My Department has had some discussions, with the Irish insurance industry about an equivalent arrangement and they have made it very clear that they do not think it is feasible in an Irish context.</p>  <p>  In addition it was concluded that even if industry were willing to participate, the State would have to be prepared to provide financial support in circumstances where the claims were above the level covered by the pool as it is unlikely that there would be sufficient capacity in the Irish reinsurance market to cover this extra amount. This is unlike Flood Re which uses a reinsurance backstop which is facilitated by the fact that there is a liquid reinsurance market in the UK.  It is important to note also that certain significant exclusions apply in the UK scheme, such as small businesses and houses built after 2009.</p>  <p>  In summary, the Department&rsquo;s review concluded that the approach of an Insurance Pool with State indemnification would lead to additional levies being imposed on all household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the State in the form of a State backstop. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to believe that its existing policy and investment in relation to flooding which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme by the OPW and Local Authorities, complemented by the exchange of information with the insurance industry on completed flood defence schemes.  This approach should lead to the increased availability of and lower cost for flood insurance and further improve the already high level of coverage in this country compared with many other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

From that engagement, I understand that neither body are aware of any models in other jurisdictions by which companies that are unable to obtain an insurance quote can avail of insurance similar to the Declined Cases Agreement.  The Bank has also advised that there is no formal cross-European mechanism in place to deal with these situations.    </p>  <p>  In addition, we are not aware of any public insurance models used in other European jurisdictions.  It should also be noted in this regard that any public insurance model, if it existed, would have to comply with the same prudential rules as apply to private insurers, namely the Solvency II Directive.  Therefore, in such a scenario the public insurer&rsquo;s consideration about providing a particular type of cover and the price to offer it are unlikely to be significantly different to that of a private insurer.       </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that unlike third party motor insurance, employer and public liability insurance is not a compulsory requirement in Ireland.  Consequently, there is no equivalent arrangement in Ireland to the Declined Cases Agreement which operates at an industry level to ensure no motorists are unable to secure the third party motor insurance that they are legally required to hold to operate a motor vehicle.  Such a proposal, if put in place, would in effect be a direct intervention by the State to force insurance companies to take on risk that they would not otherwise be willing to accept.  A consequence of this is that they would price such risk at what they consider an appropriate level which almost certainly would be prohibitively expensive.  It would not be possible in such circumstances for the Minister for Finance to direct that such cover be applied at lower levels, as neither he nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.  Another difficulty with such a proposal is that insurers generally operate in niche areas of the business market based on their risk appetite and their understanding of these areas.  Therefore, forcing companies to take on risks outside of their expertise may result in them leaving the market and it may also discourage new entrants to the Irish market. On this basis, I believe such a proposal could be counterproductive over the longer term.    </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Government is acutely aware of the difficulties that the cost and availability of liability insurance is having on businesses across the country and every effort is being made to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report in order to address the awards level differential between this country and England and Wales.  It is hoped that once this is done, there should be a significant positive impact on pricing.</p></reply>

From that date the Teaching Council has power to investigate a complaint about a teacher and to conduct fitness to teach inquiries.</p><p>Any person, including a member of the public, an employer or a teacher may make a complaint about a registered teacher.  In addition, the Teaching Council can itself make a complaint about a registered teacher. Grounds for complaint are set out in the legislation and can relate to such issues as alleged professional misconduct or poor professional performance. </p><p>The Teaching Council&rsquo;s fitness to teach processes are not intended to replace the procedures that are already in place in schools to deal with issues of professional conduct and competence. Underperformance or misconduct will continue to be dealt with first at school level and while generally school procedures should be exhausted before any inquiry by the Teaching Council takes place the Council can proceed where there are good and sufficient reasons.</p><p>In general, the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Investigating Committee has authority to consider complaints where the matters complained about took place on or after 25 July 2016. For complaints relating to professional misconduct and where the events took place before 25 July 2016, the Investigating Committee may decide to proceed to consider and investigate the complaint in exceptional circumstances, as follows: </p><p>(a)The conduct complained of is conduct that, if proven, would have constituted a criminal offence at the time that it occurred,</p><p>and  </p><p>(b)The conduct complained of is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a bona fide concern that a child or vulnerable person may be physically, sexually or emotionally exploited or abused. </p><p>The Council will tell the registered teacher if it receives a complaint about them. The Council will send the teacher a copy of the complaint, all documents enclosed with it and any further information it receives about the complaint during the complaint process. The teacher will have an opportunity to respond to the complaint.</p><p>It is a matter for the Investigating Committee to decide whether or not to refer all or part of a complaint to the Disciplinary Committee for an inquiry before a panel of the Disciplinary Committee.</p><p>An inquiry takes place in public unless the teacher or a witness about whom personal matters may be disclosed requests the panel to hold the hearing or part of the hearing in private, and the panel is satisfied that it would be appropriate to do so. </p><p>At the conclusion of an inquiry the Council may find that there is no case to answer. Alternatively there is a range of sanctions available ranging from the teacher&rsquo;s removal from the register (and consequently removing the ability to be paid in a state funded teaching post) to the provision of advice to the teacher.</p><p>Other than where the lowest level of sanction has been applied, the teacher may apply to the High Court for an annulment of the Council&rsquo;s decision.</p><p>If, as a result of the Council&rsquo;s investigation and disciplinary process, a teacher is removed from the register of teachers, then the inquiry panel can make a decision that the teacher is not eligible to apply to be restored to the register before the expiration of a period of time specified by the panel. </p><p>When the specified period of time set by the inquiry panel has elapsed, the teacher may apply to be registered again. Registration includes a requirement for the applicant teacher to satisfy the Council that he/she is a fit and proper person to be a teacher.</p><p>Further information on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s process for considering complaints about registered teachers is available on their website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

This includes how any such supports could support collaborative professionalism and innovation across the continuum of teacher education.</p>  <p>  The Council provides many supports already through the CRO&Iacute; Research Series (Collaboration and Research for Ongoing Innovation), which includes free webinars and e-zines on a range of topics for schools. It also includes the John Coolahan Research Support Framework, through which the Council allocates up to &euro;100,000 per annum to support teachers&rsquo; engagement with and in research. It hosts the annual Festival of Education in Learning and Teaching Excellence (F&Eacute;ILTE) attended by almost 1,000 people each year.</p>  <p>  The Council is keen to ensure that any additional funding which it may approve to support collaborative professionalism would leverage these and other resources in the system to be of maximum benefit to all teachers and learners.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards. The Department has acknowledged the letter and is considering the union&rsquo;s request.</p></reply>

The IDA always does everything it can - whether through site visits or in direct engagement with potential clients - to encourage overseas firms to locate or expand in regional areas. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant proportion of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. </p><p>That said, I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions remains a top priority for both the IDA and my Department. The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. In 2018, for example, the IDA delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. The last four years have seen 44,500 new FDI jobs created outside the capital. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead. </p><p>The table below outlines the number of IDA site visits to Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford in each year since 2012.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>38</td><td>31</td><td>30</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>51</td><td>61</td><td>308</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>196</td><td>180</td><td>205</td><td>242</td><td>284</td><td>327</td><td>269</td><td>1703</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>62</td><td>54</td><td>251</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>30</td><td>23</td><td>22</td><td>40</td><td>49</td><td>42</td><td>35</td><td>241</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>26</td><td>14</td><td>11</td><td>31</td><td>17</td><td>11</td><td>21</td><td>131</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<ol type="1"><li>the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</li><li>an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</li></ol>This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. </p><p>The Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including: </p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials; </p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures; </p><p>- the development of clinical guidance; </p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices; </p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and </p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented. </p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. </p><p>The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  The HSE has  published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found at: </p><p><i>hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-infants/vaginal-mesh-implants/vaginal-mesh-implants.html</i></p><p>The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks.</p></reply>

My Department is working on the development of draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p>  <p>  A draft General Scheme of a Bill is currently with legal advisers for advice and legal quality control review. As the Deputy is aware, there is presently a focus on matters relating to Brexit, including planning and preparing in a legal and legislative context. Unfortunately, this is having some impact on progressing the Heads of Bill for the NHSS at this time. However, subject to legal advice, I expect to bring the heads of bill to Government at the earliest opportunity. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect in 2019 subject to the legislative process.</p></reply>

The HPRA has advised that, of the reports received to date with clinical information confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy in relation to individuals vaccinated with Pandemrix, none of the reports where information on the date of vaccination was provided indicate a date of vaccination in 2011.  However, there are a small number of reports which do not include information on the date of vaccination.  Likewise, no medically confirmed cases of narcolepsy have been reported in association with the winter flu trivalent vaccine that contained a H1N1 component.</p>  <p>  For information, the HPRA operates the national adverse reaction reporting system which relies on submission of reports by members of the public, healthcare professionals and Marketing Authorisation Holders (i.e. pharmaceutical companies that hold the licenses for medicines (MAHs)), with members of the public and healthcare professionals encouraged to report when they consider a medicine may have contributed to the effects experienced.</p>  <p>  The composition of seasonal influenza vaccines is updated annually, if appropriate, to include relevant vaccine strains to provide appropriate protection against circulating influenza viruses.

In this regard, I am committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to re-examine the matter and respond to the Deputy directly.   </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the Convention is one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.   </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which includes a series of provisions to ensure that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is fully implemented, completed Committee Stage on 30 January 2019. The Disability Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2016 includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the UNCRPD. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles, and is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA. The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues.</p>  <p>  The Equality Division in the Department of Justice and Equality will be the designated focal point as it has policy responsibility for the equality aspects of disability matters. The Division already provides the Secretariat to the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) where the UNCRPD will be discussed regularly.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020. This lead in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively.</p></reply>

The Animal Health and Welfare Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.</p><p>Officials from my Department are directly involved in monitoring animal welfare on farms as part of their inspection duties in the areas of animal health, food safety, transportation and welfare. My Department also actively works via the regional Early Warning System to ensure that potential welfare problems in farming are identified at an early stage and wherever possible avoided.</p><p>This work is further underpinned by the Animal Welfare Helpline which my Department operates, Lo-call  0761 064408 , along with a dedicated email address, <i>AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie,</i>which facilitates the reporting by members of the public of concerns in regard to the welfare of animals.  All calls received are treated in confidence. The animal welfare hotline exists for the reporting of specific incidents relating to animal welfare which come to the attention of members of the public, which they believe are in need of attention. All complaints received are investigated and followed up on.</p><p>Control in respect of animal welfare is a matter that is also dealt with by a wider range of organisations not just my Department.  In the case of  non-farmed animals, a vital role is played by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and authorised officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA.  These latter organisations are some of the many recipients of substantial ex-gratia funding which my Department provides to underpin important work done by many organisations in the area of supporting animal welfare.</p><p>In December 2018, I announced  the largest ever Department allocation of funding to animal welfare organisations of &euro;2,751,000.  A total of 108 organisations are benefitting under these arrangements. Some of these organisations are focussed on dogs but many deal with a wide range of animals.</p></reply>

The EU Commission JRC report (2010) found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer in the EU per unit of dairy production, and the fifth most carbon efficient producer per unit of beef. However, inherent challenges remain for the sector in terms of contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and renewable energy targets.   </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently developing an environmental sustainability roadmap for the agri-food sector to ensure that the future development of agriculture and the land-use sector, including forestry, will be built upon and contribute fairly to Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets. This roadmap will be published later this year and will form a key element of the 2030 strategy.  In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required.   </p>  <p>  Meanwhile, my Department continues to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy.  The recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of measures we need to implement to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector.  My Department&rsquo;s approach is to focus on driving down the emissions intensity of Irish production through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the practical application of emerging scientific knowledge.    </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2019 that he intends to put in place a long-term trajectory for Carbon Tax increases out to 2030, in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action.   </p>  <p>  I continue to liaise with colleagues across Government on policy approaches to climate action, in particular on the development of a new &ldquo;All of Government Climate Plan&rdquo; led by my colleague Minister Bruton.</p></reply>

Agriculture Ministers were invited to comment on these documents and provide guidance to the Presidency on the next steps.     </p>  <p>  During the CAP debate, Ministers also discussed coupled income support on the basis of a paper presented by the Czech delegation.  The Netherlands delegation also informed Council of the outcome of the Congress &ldquo;CAP Strategic Plans &ndash; exploring eco-climate schemes&rdquo; which was held in Leeuwarden in early February.  Ministers also discussed the importance of the bioeconomy.   </p>  <p>  The Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 18 March was an important opportunity to highlight to the Council, the Commission and to my fellow Ministers, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the agri-food sector in Ireland and with potential knock-on effects across the EU market as a whole.  During the discussion on the meat market, I outlined the exposure of the Irish beef sector in particular and called for the full suite of measures available under the Common Market Organisation, including targeted support for farmers, to be deployed rapidly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.  I also highlighted the exposure of the Irish fisheries sector, and the need for careful joint EU management of fisheries resources, as well as financial supports for fishermen and their communities.   </p>  <p>  The Slovenian delegation presented a point of information under any other business to highlight the importance and uncertainty of small-scale fisheries in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a new, post 2020, European and Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). Commissioner Vella said that Small Scale Coastal Fisheries were an important sector for coastal communities and employment and as such enjoy preferential treatment in the EMFF proposal. Discussions on the EMFF proposal will continue in the Fisheries Council Working Party.   </p>  <p>  I also held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the impact of Brexit and the Commissioner has confirmed the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland. This process of engagement is continuing, and the Government will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agri-food sector. </p></reply>

The main aim of the scheme, which began in 2016 is to validate, in an Irish context, the strong international evidence that making homes warmer, drier and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people vulnerable to energy poverty, who are living with chronic respiratory conditions. The scheme is operating in the HSE Community Health Area 7 in Dublin postal areas 8, 10, 12, 22 and 24. &euro;20m was spent between 2016 and 2018 resulting in the upgrading of almost 900 homes.  </p>  <p>  The process of evaluating the scheme is ongoing and is being overseen by a Steering Group comprised of my Department, the Department of Health, SEAI and HSE. Reports from the HSE have indicated that the upgrades are delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants. Research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will further investigate the outcomes from the scheme. There are two strands to decision making around the future of the Warmth and Wellbeing approach, relating to health and energy. From the health perspective, the above mentioned measurement and evaluation of the data gathered from participants is necessary to validate the effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements in supporting better health outcomes. From the energy perspective key issues are, the development of effective delivery infrastructure by SEAI and the HSE, and on the ground learning about how to scale this up in the context of how we ramp up to meet the level of ambition in the NDP. Based on the outcomes of this research I will be considering the optimal next steps.</p></reply>

A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 78 fast chargers as a part of the ESB eCars network.

The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, there were over 7,600 electric vehicles on the road in Ireland &ndash; a doubling of the total from the previous year. It is estimated that the implementation of the ESB eCars project will provide the necessary fast charging infrastructure to support at least 40,000 electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  This project successfully completed the assessment stage and the validation stage is now underway. On completion of this stage further detail on the project, including information in relation to the location of chargers and a timeline, will be set out.</p>  <p>Funding for public charging in local communities is available through the Better Energy Communities Scheme. The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, supports community-based partnerships, many of which include local businesses and enterprises. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.  </p></reply>

During negotiations on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Connecting Europe Facility and Repealing Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014, the European Parliament proposed an amendment to the Annex. The Parliament's proposed amendment was to include the alignment of Derry - Sligo - Galway on the North Sea - Mediterranean Core Network Corridor. This amendment was deemed unacceptable by the European Commission on the grounds that alignments of the core network corridors can only include elements of the core TEN-T network, which as presently defined does not include any of Derry, Sligo or Galway. A number of similar proposed amendments by the Parliament concerning other Member States were also rejected on the same grounds.</p>  <p>  In late February 2019, my Department received correspondence from European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, which stated that the European Commission is considering advancing the review of the comprehensive TEN-T Network, which is due to take place no later than the end of 2023, as stipulated in the TEN-T Regulation. The Commission's review process will include: an evaluation study, to be launched this month and to conclude in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation process, opening this month and concluding in June 2019; and targeted consultation with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders, commencing in the second half of 2019. My Department intends to be fully engaged in all stages of this review process. </p>  <p>  In addition to our participation in this process, my Department will be making a formal submission to the European Commission shortly, calling for an early review of the TEN-T Network as outlined in the Programme for Government, taking into account our National Development Plan, our National Planning Framework and the implications of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Western Rail Corridor was originally included under the Transport 21 Initiative and was to be developed in Three Phases.  Phase 1 involved the reopening of the 36 mile stretch of railway line between Ennis and Athenry and this is part of the TEN-T comprehensive network.  This line was opened to the public in March 2010.  Exchequer funding of &euro;106.5 million was approved for Phase 1.</p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the development of the line from Athenry to Tuam.  However, this development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.  Phase 3 involved the development of the line from Tuam to Claremorris.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, both the 'Programme for a Partnership Government' and the recently-published 'National Development Plan' commit to an independent review of the costings for a proposal to extend the existing Western Rail Corridor.  A process for an independent financial and economic evaluation of WRC phase 2 has commenced and this will include broad consultation.  Having conducted a procurement process for contracts of this nature, Irish Rail anticipate the appointed consultants will commence work at the end of the month.  The study will take 5 to 6 months to complete and will include a comprehensive public consultation exercise.</p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that  a significant action has been taken in relation to record keeping and file management within Tusla.</p>  <p>  A National Child Care Information System, (NCCIS)  has been developed  as a technology solution to record all case history of every child, whether it be the subject of child protection or welfare referral to Tusla, to facilitate the integration and sharing of information on child protection and welfare between the relevant social work departments and to be a pathway to generate reports between local and national level all in real time. </p>  <p>  The system allows social workers to record work and track the progress of the case  of each child including any concerns that may arise. All case notes, attached documents, relevant information are held on NCCIS as the Master File and the system can be searched nationally by Tusla child protection and welfare staff, facilitating integration and sharing of information across the country. The system also allows social work team leaders and principal social workers to monitor case records.  </p>  <p>  Effective information governance and quality information are central to improving the quality of services provided to vulnerable children and families. The further roll out of the National Child Care NCCIS to all 17 Tusla areas this year, replacing paper-based systems and legacy electronic systems, will benefit Tusla.  For the first time, Tusla social workers are working off an integrated national IT system for child protection and welfare services which facilitates the integration and sharing of information. The system replaces all previous methods of record keeping and my officials will be updated on the roll out, integration and further development of this system.</p></reply>

Children and young people, depending on their identified needs, may be placed  in foster care, either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, or special care. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.</p>  <p>  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.    </p>  <p>  There are regular area recruitment campaigns to meet the ongoing need to continue to recruit  foster carers as carers retire from fostering.  Fostering teams are responsible for the recruitment and assessment of foster carers. When an assessment is complete, a report is presented to the Foster Care Committee who decide whether or not to approve the applicant.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of an appropriate range of foster carers is part of Tusla's business plan. Tusla are particularly interested in recruiting foster carers with the skills required to look after children with complex needs, or from a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The recently published HIQA overview inspection of Tusla foster care services found that a range of approaches were being employed locally to recruit a wider range of foster carers.</p>  <p>  For children who cannot live either at home or in  foster care, there are a number of types of residential care settings that may be appropriate, of which secure care is one type.</p></reply>

These include problems with addiction, mental health and in many situations, violence in the home.  Tusla is dependent, in the main, on services provided by other agencies to assist parents with their difficulties,  in order for satisfactory conclusions to be reached regarding the children. Where parents are not in a position to provide safe and appropriate care for the children Tusla may apply to the courts for a care order or may enter into an agreement with the parent for the child to be received into voluntary care. </p></reply>

If the preliminary enquiry finds that the family would benefit from a welfare support and  that a child protection response is not merited, the case could be diverted for a welfare response at this point. The preliminary enquiry also determines the priority status of each case.</p><p>Cases that are cannot be immediately  allocated to a social worker are overseen by duty social work teams, and about one fifth of cases may be dealt with as &ldquo;active on duty&rdquo; where specific actions by the social work team are taking place, including information gathering and visits to see the child. </p><p>Tusla collate data on the number of referrals that proceed to preliminary enquiry and initial assessment.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In 2019, &euro;60.4m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services, an increase of &euro;1.5m on 2018. The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  Funding to staff led youth services has generally been targeted at areas of disadvantage and not in proportion to the youth population of a given area.  Funding allocations for 2019 are currently being finalised by the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department.  Letters of allocation will issue shortly.</p>  <p>  In 2018, an amount of &euro;539,282 was allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland. My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Targeted Youth Funding Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.   </p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State as well as an Area Profiling, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement tool currently being used by Kildare Wicklow ETB. This mapping and tool will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.   My Department is committed to working with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

Another significant portion is to continue our journey to build an accessible, affordable and high quality Early Learning and Care system.</p>  <p>  Just over half of my Department&rsquo;s funding is targeted at services within Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to protect our children and to provide for their welfare. Tusla will receive additional funding of &euro;31 million in 2019 bringing its overall allocation to &euro;785 million. In addition to this, I am making a further &euro;3 million available to Tusla for specific developments in 2019 in relation to Family Resource Centres and Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence services.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;59 million is being provided for early learning and care programmes in 2019 which will bring early learning and care funding to just under &euro;575 million. Children, parents and providers are all set to benefit. The increased resource allows me to continue to meet the growing demand for universal and targeted supports. It also enables me to widen the thresholds of the new National Childcare Scheme that I will introduce later this year</p>  <p>  In addition to these areas, my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2019 contains provision for almost &euro;63.6 million for Youth Services. These resources will fund youth services throughout the country, including services for those at risk of disadvantage and help address some of the remaining challenges faced by LGBTI+ young people.  </p>  <p>  Other key areas of expenditure include &euro;26 million for the costs of Irish Youth Justice Service, including operational costs for the Oberstown Children Detention Centre; &euro;19 million for the operational costs of my own Department; &euro;9.5 million for Prevention and Early Intervention Programmes (which now includes the Area Based Childhood Programme and the PPFS Programme); &euro;7 million for the Intervention Programme for Children and Young People; &euro;5 million for the Adoption Authority of Ireland; &euro;4 million for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and just under &euro;3 million for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the significant additional resources secured for 2019 will enable my Department and its agencies build on the good work achieved to date. The extra funding continues this Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide high quality services for children and young people. </p></reply>

If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is at risk, this information is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, the Garda&iacute; should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla act immediately on notification of an immediate risk to a child.  Tusla, when alerted to a child at immediate risk, for instance a young child left alone at home or abandoned, will contact AGS if the child needs to be removed from that situation.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla.

In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA). Private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. Inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials. The overview of these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.   </p>  <p>  Tusla also  has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Tusla provides monthly, quarterly and annual information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers. Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.   </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.</p></reply>

An eligible child is defined as a child aged 16 years or over who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18. An eligible adult is defined as a person aged 18, 19 or 20 (inclusive) who was in the care of the State for at least 12 months between the ages of 13 and 18.</p><p>When confirmed eligible, an assessment of need will be undertaken jointly by the child&rsquo;s social worker and after care service within four months, or six months prior to their 18<sup>th</sup>birthday. The aftercare plan will be determined by each young person&rsquo;s assessment of need. </p><p>The assessment of need determines the level of support which the young person will require as part of an aftercare plan. It encompasses all categories of need including, at a minimum:</p><p>- Education</p><p>- Financing and budgeting matters</p><p>- Training and employment</p><p>- Health and wellbeing</p><p>- Personal and  social development</p><p>- Accommodation.</p><p>- Family/emotional support </p><p>The assessment of need will determine whether the young person requires an allocated aftercare worker.</p><p>Following the assessment of need Tusla will prepare an aftercare plan, if required.  An aftercare plan is a written plan that is prepared by the aftercare worker and the young person in conjunction with their social worker and other key people in their lives. These plans can be reviewed at the request of the young person or a person acting on their behalf. </p><p>Tusla reports in Q3 2018 that almost half of young people, aged 18 to 22, remained living with their  former foster carers.  This indicates a strong support in the transition for these young people. </p><p>Aftercare services provided by Tusla include:</p><p>- An allocated aftercare worker from the age of 17 years up to the age of 21 years and up to 23 years if in education/ training (depending on the assessment of need)</p><p>- A drop-in service - which will provide advice guidance, support and signposting when required to all young people eligible for aftercare provision.</p><p>- Financial support based on a financial needs assessment and eligibility for those in education or accredited training up to the age of 21 years, or until completion of their course of education up to the age of 23 years.</p><p>- Tusla provide a young person in aftercare in education or training  with an allowance of &euro;300 per week.</p><p>Other financial benefits</p><p>- Young people in aftercare are also eligible for the higher SUSI grant.  Unemployed young people in aftercare are eligible for the over 25 year old rate of unemployment benefit.</p></reply>

It is clear that if we are to successfully encourage people to return to living in town centres, an integrated solution involving all aspects of town living and supporting infrastructure needs to be considered.</p><p>The Steering Group therefore agreed that a pilot scheme, which takes a holistic approach to town centre living, should be developed in a small number of towns initially, with a view to a wider roll-out over time.  This approach goes beyond simply identifying specific property units, and will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations.  </p><p>The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p><p>Six rural towns were invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme which was launched in October 2018.  These are: </p><p>1. Boyle, Co. Roscommon</p><p>2. Callan, Co. Kilkenny</p><p>3. Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo</p><p>4. Banagher, Co. Offaly</p><p>5. Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan</p><p>6. Cappoquin, Co.

The funding will assist the Local Authorities to engage with their communities and local businesses, and arrive at practical solutions that can be delivered to achieve the objective of increasing the number of people living in our rural towns.</p><p>Representatives from each of the six Local Authorities involved in the pilot have had a number of meetings with my Department with a view to developing the detailed schemes.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p></reply>

The scheme provides modest payments to landowners to maintain these trails, based on agreed individual work programmes.</p><p>A current allocation of &euro;2 million per annum was provided for the scheme each year from 2016 to 2018 inclusive to cover these payments.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme.  In line with this commitment, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed. </p><p>My Department has recently advertised for expressions of interest from Local Development Companies and Local Authorities for walks that might be considered for inclusion in the expanded scheme.  My Department will consider these Expressions of Interest under a number of criteria, including the strategic importance of the trail, landowner agreement to participate, state of readiness, etc. </p><p>In addition to the core &euro;2 million funding, there are other costs associated with the scheme, including salary costs for Rural Recreation Officers who help to implement the scheme at local level, and small capital costs.</p><p>Table 1 below outlines the expenditure on the Walks Scheme from 2016 to 2019.  Payments to landowners are made twice yearly - mid-year and at the end of the year.  Hence, no payments have yet been made in 2019.</p><p>Table 2 below outlines the number of walks and the number of participants per county on the Walks Scheme from 2016 to 2018. It should be noted that the Scheme currently operates on 39 walks in total.  However, a small number of the walks included in the scheme cut across county and administrative boundaries, and are therefore recorded under all relevant county headings in the table below.  There is no duplication in the number of participants covered by the scheme. </p><p><b>Table 1 - Walks Scheme Expenditure 2016- 2019 </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Current   Expenditure</th><th>Capital   Expenditure</th><th>Total   Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;2,305,615</td><td>&euro;101,500</td><td>&euro;2,407,115</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;2,416,501</td><td>&euro;150,100</td><td>&euro;2,566,601</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;2,526,046</td><td>&euro;130,100</td><td>&euro;2,656,146</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 - No. of walks and participants by county</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>Scheme Walks per County </th><th>Participants 2016</th><th>Participants 2017</th><th>Participants 2018</th></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>4</td><td>96</td><td>87</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>5</td><td>628</td><td>629</td><td>641</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>2</td><td>79</td><td>79</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>2</td><td>52</td><td>54</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>4</td><td>291</td><td>292</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>3</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>1</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>5</td><td>229</td><td>230</td><td>230</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>1</td><td>27</td><td>26</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>3</td><td>163</td><td>162</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>2</td><td>67</td><td>68</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>9</td><td>114</td><td>115</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1</td><td>60</td><td>58</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>44</td><td>1911</td><td>1905</td><td>1926 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.</p>  <p>  Wherever possible reviews will be processed using information already held by my Department.  In some cases additional information is being requested to ensure people receives the best rate possible.  Approximately 25,000 requests for information have issued to date.  It is important that prompt responses are received to those requests so that the reviews can be completed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Reviews commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary regulations which together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made.  The most recently available figures show that as at week ending 22 March 2019, 8,367 reviews have been completed.  </p>  <p>  It will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the number involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  Over 100 temporary staff have been recruited to help with this work.  Outcomes will issue to all pensioners in writing when their review is complete.  </p>  <p>  Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay and arrears issued backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.   </p>  <p>  Given the scale (90,000 pensioners) involved, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it would not be reasonable to expect all to be processed immediately. While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing. </p>  <p>   Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly. Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks. I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements.</p>  <p>  The rent contribution agreement stipulates that "the HAP claimant acknowledges that the Local Authority will immediately suspend or cease making the Housing Assistance Payment to the landlord on behalf of the HAP Claimant in respect of the tenancy at the Property.  Upon the Local Authority ceasing to make the Housing Assistance Payment the HAP Claimant shall immediately become liable for all and any rent payable to the landlord." In practice, however, suspension would not normally take immediate effect and engagement with the tenant is initiated.   </p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  Apart from issuing the formal notification letters, there would always be attempts to contact the tenants by phone and by email to settle accounts and avoid escalation of the debt process. Depending on the particular arrears in question, both the relevant local authority and the landlord are informed when an account has not been cleared and of possible suspension and/ or cessation of the HAP payment.  However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord. </p>  <p>  If the tenant does not contact their local authority or does not enter into a payment arrangement within 8 weeks of the arrears commencing, both the landlord and the tenant are informed that the HAP payment may be ceased.</p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the practice of the SSC is appropriate, measured and effective and that local authorities, as housing authorities, have the expertise and resources to discharge their responsibilities towards social housing households including consideration of changed financial positions for households in HAP. There is no requirement for guidance from my Department to be issued regarding implementation of the debt collection process which is a matter for Local Authorities and the SSC operating on their behalf.</p>  <p>  In relation to the average time in, and amount of, arrears outstanding at the time of cessation, the SSC advise that this information is not readily available from their system as they operate from a live system. They have not historically extracted specific information at the exact point at which the tenancy is ceased and what the balance is at that point in time. Information is only recorded on the current balance which will more than likely have changed since the tenancy was ceased if a write off of the amount outstanding had been approved or if the tenant began to pay off the arrears. </p>  <p>  To date, the approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2018, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. Since HAP was rolled out in 2014 to end 2018, HAP support has been ceased for 665 tenancies due to tenant differential rent arrears. This represents 1.2% of all tenancies set up during that period.</p>  <p>  Tenancy sustainment is a very important factor in relation to keeping households in their homes. This is why the SSC operate, on behalf of the 31 local authorities, a graduated approach to cessation rather than the immediate cessation outlined in the rent contribution agreement. There are a number of avenues for a tenant experiencing financial difficulty including early engagement with the relevant local authority or the Community Welfare Officer. Notwithstanding the assistance available to tenants, there is a fundamental need for a tenant to acknowledge and make the maximum effort to fulfil their personal responsibilities and requirements in relation to contributing to their accommodation costs and to engage early when difficulties arise. The rent contribution that a household is asked to pay is calculated by the local authority having regard to the financial circumstances of the household and affordability. The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of the contributions from households and exchequer funding, so it is absolutely critical that additional unnecessary burden is not placed on the exchequer to offset non-payment of differential rent.</p>  <p>  As the HAP scheme grows, the SSC are continuously working to improve systems and processes, including debt management processes. My Department, with the assistance of stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, HAP Practitioners from local authorities and also the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will continue to work with the SSC to ensure that the debt management process is reasonable and effective and that the appropriate tenancy sustainment options are in place.</p></reply>

Guidelines entitled &ldquo;Rent Assessment, Collection, Accounting and Arrears Control&rdquo; were published by the Housing Unit (which subsequently became part of the Housing Agency) in January 2001.  These guidelines, developed in conjunction with my Department and the City and County Management Association, set out good practice in the administration of rent related matters.  The Guidelines stated that local authorities should review the rent assessment of all existing tenants at least annually to ensure that all tenants are paying the correct rent and to update rents to reflect changes in tenants&rsquo; incomes and in housing management costs.</p>  <p>  It will normally be a part of the tenancy agreement that the tenant should inform the local authority of any change in circumstances, including increases in family income.  When this is done by the tenant, any change in rent that is warranted can be applied promptly.</p>  <p>  The above Guidelines also state that arrangements for the repayment of rent arrears should be determined primarily by the tenants&rsquo; ability to pay.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of the potential for a draft national differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  </p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and  a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link: . </p><p>In addition, in relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review Part B &ndash; Fire Safety and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwellings only.  A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, which includes apartments, is being prepared for public consultation.</p><p>Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:</p><p>- Amendments to the Building  Control Regulations; </p><p>- Establishment of a  shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction IndustryRegister Ireland) Bill.</p><p>These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

In accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, the decision to borrow is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned, who have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions and are accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.   </p>  <p>  Section 106 of the said Act also provides that local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to undertake borrowing. In this regard, a request to borrow for housing land acquisition can be submitted by the local authority to my Department.  Sanction may be granted based on an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the Clonburris Strategic Development Zone. Following an oral hearing, a decision is not expected until the middle of 2019.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

Similar reports were produced at that time on Athlone, Carlow and Waterford. </p>  <p>   Given the strategic importance of such towns and cities where development and population overspill across county boundaries has occurred, it is my intention to introduce statutory joint structures to address boundary issues. This would entail a framework of statutory requirements to deal with the development and other interests of the areas concerned, rather than alteration of county boundaries or reliance solely on existing inter-authority co-operation. This would mainly involve functions similar to those which might be performed through inter-authority arrangements but on a more comprehensive, permanent and formalised basis under primary legislation. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that such urban area structures would have responsibility for certain key strategic matters beyond the existing standard functions of local authorities, especially in relation to spatial and economic planning and development and in relation to transportation strategy, forward planning and land use designation, retail strategy, and other such matters as the relevant local authorities agree.</p>  <p>  A specific local area plan has not been adopted for the cross-boundary area of Drogheda and, while an implementation group specifically targeting the Boundary Committee report is not established, there is strong ongoing cooperation between Louth and Meath County Councils. I have very recently met with the respective chief executives, and with chief executives from other local authorities with cross-boundary towns and cities, and I plan to make further progress on strengthened urban area structures for cross-boundary towns and cities in the coming months.</p></reply>

Working with the broader Housing and Planning Divisions in my Department, other key agencies, local authorities and the construction sector, the HDO supports the roll-out of complex projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery, and monitors progress across key sites as they progress. </p>  <p>  At the time of its establishment, the HDO comprised a team of 4 people with extensive expertise in project management, finance, planning and local government, including staff seconded from the local government sector and the National Development Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Having carried out a range of initial initiatives, and taking account of the fact that some assignments to the office were time-limited, the HDO was refocused in September 2017 to work more closely on supporting local housing delivery and land management. In that context, the current team of 3  comprises 1 civil servant and 2 officers with experience of housing delivery and the local government sector.  These officers have service ranging from 9 to 28 months in the HDO.  In addition to this complement of staff the HDO draws on supports from other relevant Business Units in my Department and other relevant public bodies and this can give rise to movements of staff resources between these connected areas from time to time.  </p>  <p>  As with all critical areas of activity in my Department, the resources available to the HDO are kept under regular review in the context of the ongoing evolution of the Office&rsquo;s role.  </p></reply>

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>  <p>  To support the introduction of affordable housing, including cost rental, the Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure, under the Serviced Sites Fund, over the next three years.  </p>  <p>  Two path-finder cost rental projects are currently being progressed. Firstly, the Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and two Approved Housing Bodies (Respond and T&uacute;ath) are working on a project at the Enniskerry Road, Dublin, which will deliver 50 cost rental homes. This project is providing very valuable learning and is helping to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects. Planning permission is currently in place and tenders have been assessed. An application submitted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund last year in relation to the project was successful. It is anticipated that construction will commence on this project in the second quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  The second project, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road in Inchicore, is estimated to have the potential to accommodate circa. 470 homes in a high quality development.  The current tenure mix as agreed with by my Department is 30% Social and 70% Cost Rental.  It is expected that the procurement process for the design team will get underway in Q2 2019.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated by the National Development Finance Agency that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable.  The new apartment guidelines were applied to all units.  The European Investment Bank is also working on this project in terms of financial and advisory services.</p></reply>

The purpose of a CBA is to assess whether or not the social and economic benefits associated with a project are greater than its social and economic costs. The CBA compares the costs of alternative ways in which an objective, or set of objectives, can be achieved, to determine the optimum path for the project. </p>  <p>  My Department received CBAs/CEAs in relation to eleven housing projects over the period 2017/2018, of which just one was submitted in 2017.
