Local Authorities were invited to submit up to 12 applications to my Department for consideration under the scheme.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 28th June.  My officials will be assessing all of the applications received, and decisions on the applications will be made when the assessment process is completed.</p><p>The Action Plan for Rural Development includes a commitment to develop a pilot scheme to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  I launched this initiative last October and announced that six towns had been invited to participate in the initial pilot.  The 6 towns which were identified for inclusion in the pilot are:  </p><p>1.Boyle, Co. Roscommon</p><p>2.Callan, Co. Kilkenny</p><p>3.Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo</p><p>4.Banagher, Co. Offaly</p><p>5.Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan </p><p>6.Cappoquin, Co. Waterford</p><p>Funding of up to &euro;100,000 each is being made available to these towns to develop proposals to encourage town centre living.  This funding is being used by the Local Authorities to engage with communities and local businesses to identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in their town centres.  It is envisaged that the solutions they identify could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p><p>The lessons learnt through this pilot initiative can help to inform our approach to supporting and investing in rural towns and villages in the future. I recently received interim progress reports from each of the relevant Local Authorities involved in the Pilot Scheme and anticipate receiving a comprehensive report in respect of the entire pilot initiative, before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over 10 years to the Fund and &euro;315 million is allocated to the Fund for the period 2019-2022.  </p>  <p>  In November 2018 and February 2019 I announced details of a total of 38 Category 1 projects (capital projects which were fully planning and consent ready) and 46 Category 2 projects (those needing further development to make them ready for delivery) which were successful under the first call from the Fund, providing &euro;86m in support for projects worth a total of &euro;117m.  </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the successful projects, my Department engaged with each lead party to complete due diligence requirements.  Contractual arrangements were also drawn up with the release of funding based on the achievement of key milestones in the projects.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that significant progress is already being made on the implementation of successful projects.  A number of the projects have already met their first milestone and had funding released.   To date, &euro;1,722,043 has been drawn down from the Fund by seven separate projects.  This is made up of &euro;1,654,161 drawn down for five Category 1 projects to date and &euro;67,882 for two Category 2 projects.</p>  <p>  I expect that payments from the Fund will significantly accelerate over the coming weeks and months as further milestones are achieved across all the 84 projects.</p></reply>

I am aware of the current situation in Hartstown Community Centre and I know how important the centre is to the community there.  </p>  <p>  Community facilities are funded from a range of different sources across different Government Departments and agencies.  In many cases, they also receive funding supports from the local authority, as is the case in Hartstown.  </p>  <p>  My Department funds the Community Enhancement Programme which funded capital projects to the total value of &euro;12.5m in 2018 and can be used to contribute towards the renovation of community infrastructure such as community centres.   There is an initial allocation of &euro;4.5m nationally under this programme in 2019.  The Programme is administered locally by the Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each Local Authority area.  Fingal County Council has been allocated &euro;163,310 in respect of the CEP this year.</p>  <p>  Given my overall responsibility within Government for Community Development, I am looking at ways in which my Department might assist in finding a resolution to this particular situation.  I understand the local authority concerned, Fingal County Council, is also  engaging with the Centre.   </p></reply>

Charitable status was granted to the company by the Revenue Commissioners on the 20th November 1996.  In 2005 ADM was re-named Pobal.  In accordance with Section 40 of the Charities Act, 2009, Pobal was entered onto the Register of Charitable Organisations on 16 October 2014.  </p><p>The basis for Pobal having charitable status is tied to the objects of the Company, which are specified in its Memorandum and Articles of Association.  I am satisfied that Pobal is fully compliant with the relevant legislative requirements including those of the Charities Act, 2009.  </p><p>On its own initiative, Pobal undertook a review of its charitable status and in that regard sought independent legal advice on the matter.  The review has now concluded.  The Board of Pobal met in May 2019 to finalise their discussions relating to the review. I understand that it was decided by the Board that it was appropriate for the company to retain its charitable status.  An update on the review was provided to my officials at an Oversight Meeting in June.  I am satisfied that Pobal have considered the matter thoroughly and have acted appropriately on the findings of the review.  </p></reply>

The introduction of such a scheme is a key priority for my Department to protect land owners and to support the continued provision of access to the countryside for recreational users.</p>  <p>  My Department has been advised that an indemnity scheme such as the one envisaged will require legislative provision.  In this context, my officials met with the Attorney General's Office recently to explore the various options open to the Department and to identify the precise legislation which would require to be introduced to implement such a scheme.  It appears that a number of separate pieces of legislation could require amendment. </p>  <p>  In light of the complexity involved, I am also considering other options that might be available to address the matter as an interim measure.  My officials have been making enquiries into alternative options and will continue to work to find a solution that meets the concerns of landowners who provide access to their lands for recreational purposes. </p></reply>

My own Department has several programmes in place to assist disadvantaged communities both urban and rural, and in the forthcoming discussions on Budget 2020 I will be seeking to ensure that we can continue to provide supports to communities who need it most.  </p>  <p>  While additional funding is always welcome, it is important to acknowledge the great work that is currently underway with resources provided by my Department.  For example, in Dublin, the SICAP programme will provide &euro;9.7m in 2019, giving vital support to those community groups and individuals most in need.  In addition, under the Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) my Department allocated &euro;675k to the Dublin area in 2019 so that community groups could avail of small capital grants to improve facilities in their areas.  </p>  <p>  The Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each area manages the SICAP programme and administers the CEP at a local level to ensure the funding is targeted to address disadvantage.  LCDCs play a key role in tackling issues in disadvantaged areas, bringing a more coordinated, whole-of-Government approach to local and community development.  They are best placed to ensure that state funding is channelled to those areas and communities most in need.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with Local Authorities through the LCDCs to ensure that appropriate local plans are developed and available resources are targeted effectively to support the development of vibrant and sustainable communities. </p></reply>

While there were some issues concerning the administrative requirements at the start of the programme, over the course of the last 2 years, I have implemented a series of actions to simplify the delivery of LEADER. These actions were developed in consultation with the Local Action Groups themselves. </p><p>I have previously highlighted the package of 31 actions I made to improve the programme. This package included: </p><p>1.  A significant reduction in the number of checks that are carried out on project applications; </p><p>2.  A standardised application form to assist applicants and streamline the approval process; and,</p><p>3.  Revised and clarified procurement arrangements.</p><p>In addition, I have continued to make a number of additional changes, over and above the package of 31 actions, to further empower Local Action Groups to approve projects.  </p><p>The impact of these changes is clear to see. 2,135 LEADER projects have been approved for funding of &euro;75.8 million since the programme commenced.  Almost 100 other Food and Co-operation projects have also been approved at national level, outside of the core budget available to the LAGs. </p><p>The amount of funding approved last year was over double that approved in 2017.  This year alone, nearly 600 projects have already been approved. </p><p>While my Department will continue to examine ways to further enhance the programme, I am satisfied that changes already made have substantially improved the process for LEADER applicants. </p></reply>

Projects must be selected under the programme by the end of 2020, while payments will continue in 2021 and later years as necessary.  </p>  <p>  We are now making significant progress in the delivery of the LEADER programme. 2,135 project applications have been approved by the LAGs for funding of over &euro;75.8 million. A further 383 projects seeking funding of &euro;27.6 million are at earlier stages of the approvals process. </p>  <p>  In addition, almost 100 projects have been approved at national level, outside of the core budget available to the LAGs, for Food and Co-operation projects.</p>  <p>  The level of progress on the LEADER programme varies between each Local Action Group.  However, on average, the LAGs have indicated that over 80% of their available project budget will be allocated by the end of 2019. This will place the LAGs in a strong position to allocate the full amount of funding available before the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  Indeed, there is a growing demand for more LEADER funding to be made available in some areas. In this regard, I was very pleased to announce earlier this week that an additional &euro;5 million will be shared between the LAGs that are most advanced in delivering the LEADER programme.  This is further evidence of the huge progress made since my Department introduced a range of administrative improvements to the programme in 2017 and 2018. </p></reply>

The CFI was circulated to a wide range of stakeholders and was also posted on my Department's website .  This paper was designed to inform stakeholders about the proposed development of the strategy, to seek their views on what constitutes volunteering and what the strategy should contain.</p><p>Among the areas that stakeholders were asked to provide their views on were:  </p><p>- a definition of volunteering;</p><p>- a shared vision for the future of Irish volunteering; </p><p>- the objectives of a draft volunteering strategy; </p><p>- the volunteering community; </p><p>- governance and funding issues; </p><p>- various challenges and opportunities that exist within volunteering today; and  </p><p>- monitoring, measuring and evaluating the impact of volunteering in society. </p><p>The response to the CFI was presented to the a National Advisory Group on Volunteering at its inaugural meeting, on 29th May 2019. The Group, which will advise on and oversee the development of the strategy,  is made up of a range of stakeholders representing Government and the community and voluntary sector.  It is chaired by Minister of State, Se&aacute;n Canney. </p><p>It is anticipated that the draft strategy will be completed later this year, following which there will be a further opportunity for the public to provide input before the strategy is finally presented to Government for approval.</p></reply>

However, my Department is very involved in the promotion of access to the countryside for recreational purposes. In that regard  Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) was established in February 2004 as a non-statutory body with a primary focus on the priority areas of access to the countryside, developing a countryside code, and developing a countryside recreation strategy.  </p>  <p>  Under a Comhairle na Tuaithe initiative, in 2011, a Mountain Access Scheme to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities was developed in two pilot areas; one at Mount Gable in Connemara and the other in the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.</p>  <p>  In order to help progress the Mountain Access Scheme, SLR Consultants with the support of the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, South Kerry Development Partnership and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, were tasked with assessing the potential for structured permissive access to the MacGillycuddy Reeks uplands and to identify the most appropriate management structure to ensure the sustainable management of the integral environmental and cultural heritage of the Reeks, while providing long term clarity on permissive recreational access to the mountains.  I understand that the SLR report also suggested a set of Key Performance Indicators covering issues such as management, revenue, training &amp;amp; education, enterprise and communication.</p>  <p>  On foot of the recommendations in the SLR report, a Management Forum, whose job it was to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report, was established in the Kerry pilot area in 2014.</p>  <p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe also established a Mountain Access Project Steering Group in 2014, which was tasked with reviewing progress in respect of the Mountain Access Pilots, developing signage for Mountain Access Pilot areas, and issues around a National Indemnity Scheme. During this time, tendering took place for the design of a mountain access logo, and mountain access signage and information panels for the two pilot areas, which are now in place.</p>  <p>  On 6th June last, at its first meeting of 2019, I presented a new mandate to Comhairle na Tuaithe which will reinforce and strengthen its advisory role in relation to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland.  At this meeting, I also announced the appointment of Dr. Liam Twomey as the new Chair of Comhairle.  </p>  <p>  I have also asked Comhairle to identify opportunities to develop rural enterprises based on outdoor recreation activity, and to consider the scope for the development of a new National Strategy for Outdoor Recreation, taking account of recent developments and investments across the sector. </p>  <p>  Also, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been working to develop a National Indemnity Scheme to indemnify private land owners, particularly in Mountain Access Scheme areas, with regard to the use of their lands for recreational purposes which when in place will further facilitate access to the countryside for recreational purposes, including mountain climbing. </p></reply>

The application processes for these programmes are reviewed before each call for applications is issued to ensure they are user friendly and fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the criteria for the CL&Aacute;R Programme, my Department initiated a process for the 2019 programme whereby local authorities further assist communities by verifying information for applicants and ensuring that all required permissions, match-funding, etc., are in place so applications fulfil all the scheme requirements. </p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme is the result of a review of the Communities Facilities Scheme and RAPID programme and provides a more flexible, streamlined and targeted approach to providing small scale infrastructure funding of a regenerative nature to enhance facilities in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  My Department also offers information sessions and workshops for communities and groups on its funding programmes and schemes. This is done to help applicants understand the schemes, criteria which apply and with completing the application process. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the issues faced by some communities who wish to apply for funding, but are hampered in completing application forms in a satisfactory manner due to capacity issues. </p>  <p>  To assist communities a series of regional &lsquo;Rural Opportunity' information sessions were hosted by my Department recently to raise awareness of the wide variety of funding supports available to rural communities from across Government Departments. Staff from my Department and a number of other Departments and agencies were also on hand at the events to provide further information to attendees on the range of supports available. </p>  <p>  My Department also recently ran a series of 'Helping Hands' workshops designed to make groups more aware of grant programmes, and to provide guidance on how to make an application. The events were aimed at community groups that have had no success, or limited success, previously and aim to provide hints and tips on how to make a better application and how to identify local supports that community groups can draw upon.</p>  <p>  The LEADER programme, which comes under the remit of my Department, is delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 sub-regional areas. I am committed to making the application process for LEADER as efficient as possible for all applicants. </p>  <p>  My Department engages regularly with the Local Action Groups (LAGs) that deliver LEADER to identify potential areas for programme improvement. Following a forum held with the LAGs in May 2017, I have implemented a series of 31 improvements to streamline the LEADER programme. I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the LEADER Programme to ensure the process is as streamlined as possible while being mindful of the EU Regulations governing the Programme. </p>  <p>  I believe these efforts will see any administrative barriers that may exist reduced in order that our funding has the broadest possible reach and that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is committed to keeping under review the administration of all our funding programmes and schemes to ensure they remain fit for purpose, targeted, can be accessed by those who need the supports most and are delivering benefits for communities across the country.

I also chair the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce which was established in 2016 to identify and overcome obstacles to mobile phone and broadband services. The Taskforce is a cross-Government initiative comprising senior officials from a number of Departments and State bodies.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the importance of access to high-speed, high-quality broadband services in rural areas and I engage regularly with my Ministerial colleagues in both Departments in finding ways to remove barriers to the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall policy responsibility for the National Broadband Plan. However, the Department of Rural and Community Development works closely with that Department and with Local Authorities to help prepare rural communities for the roll out of high-speed broadband.  </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, which is co-ordinated by officials of the two Departments, has successfully addressed a number of complex issues over the last three years, many of which will facilitate the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan when the contract for the State Intervention Area is signed.  Quarterly Progress Reports on the work of the Taskforce are published on the websites of both Departments, and on the Gov.ie portal.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development also supports preparations for the roll out of the National Broadband Plan through the network of Broadband Officers located in each Local Authority.  The Broadband Officers are co-funded by the Department and provide a vital point of contact for industry and the public regarding telecoms issues. </p>  <p>  The Broadband Officers are also leading on the development of Digital Strategies for each Local Authority.  These Digital Strategies will enable communities to make full use of digital technology in their daily lives, and will be particularly beneficial when the Broadband Plan is rolled out.</p></reply>

To help these groups, my Department held a series of six 'Helping Hands' events nationwide earlier this year, to make groups more aware of funding programmes, and to provide practical guidance on making applications. These events provided hints and tips on how to make a better funding application and how to identify local supports that community groups can draw upon.</p>  <p>  The response to these events has been overwhelmingly positive and my hope is that individuals and communities will be encouraged to take their own ideas or projects forward.  These events and other ongoing measures will ensure that our funding has the broadest possible reach and that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports. </p></reply>

Indeed Cyber Security is a standing item on the agenda of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I chair. </p>  <p>   The response to cyber threats remains a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment taking the lead role, with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the delivery of measures to improve the cyber security of the State.    </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is located in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provides a range of cyber security services to owners of Government IT infrastructure and Critical National Infrastructure. The NCSC is also home to the national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE), which acts as a national point of contact involving entities within Ireland, and as the point of contact for international discussions on issues of cyber security.  The scope of CSIRT-IE's activities covers prevention, detection, response and mitigation services to Government Departments and State agencies and critical national infrastructure providers. </p>  <p>   The Defence Forces provide seconded specialists to assist with the work of this team when resources allow. Also, as in any emergency/crisis situation, once the Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces may provide additional support to the CSIRT-IE team in so far as resources allow. </p>  <p>   Details regarding the specific establishment and composition of the Defence Forces Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) cannot be provided for operational and security reasons. In addition, I am informed by the military authorities that there is no external procurement for the Defence Forces Cyber Security Incident Response Team. From time to time the Defence Forces does go to the market for security related services.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles. Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I also wish to assure you that the Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills and equipment.

This is underlined by a commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  Unlike some other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions with regard to the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas on peacekeeping missions. In this regard, the Defence Forces participates on an international level in the sphere of Women, Peace and Security (WPS). Ireland's third National Action Plan  on WPS renews Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the Women, Peace and Security agenda, setting out how Ireland will continue to promote and implement the objectives of the agenda in its programme support activities, diplomatic advocacy and policy-making across the interrelated areas of peace, security and development. In relation to overseas deployment, a female Officer in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, is currently serving as Advisor to NATO Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security and a female officer in the Acting rank of Brigadier General has been appointed Deputy Force Commander in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). In 2016 a female officer commanded a Defence Forces contingent in UNDOF on a six month tour of duty. </p>  <p>  The participation by female personnel in all aspects of Defence Forces operations is further exemplified in the Defence Forces Equality Policy and the Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan, which outlines the Organisation&rsquo;s commitment to gender equality and its proactive approaches to recruiting females. </p>  <p>  In line with these policies and commitments, a number of initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. For example:   </p>  <p>  - Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment and within the general recruitment framework. </p>  <p>  - In order to extend the reach to the target demographic of 18-26 year old women, the Defence Forces has initiated a collaboration with Irish sporting bodies, commencing with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). </p>  <p>  - The introduction of best practices in recruitment such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants and a balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards.</p>  <p>   A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces are committed to gender equality and employ a gender perspective in all policies and regulations. Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote a gender perspective in operations.  </p>  <p>  A Defence Forces Women's Network has been established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. The Network allows women to identify any actual or perceived barriers to participation, which then feed into wider HR retention policies. The Defence Forces were shortlisted for the CIPD (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) Awards 2018, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion category, for its Women&rsquo;s Network initiative.</p>  <p>  A number of family friendly overseas appointments for commissioned and enlisted personnel have been introduced, where the normal 6-month tour of duty can be &lsquo;shared&rsquo; with another member of the Defence Forces resulting in a 3 month deployment. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces maternity policy includes measures such as Defence Forces personnel not being detailed for overseas/sea going service until a child has reached the age of two, to allow the mother to care for the child as part of a family friendly policy.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the White Paper on Defence 2015, a ten year strategy, further initiatives and projects will be developed to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks. This will include a survey to identify any impediments to the advancement of women in the Permanent Defence Force, as well as the impact of the requirements of career courses and overseas service on female retention and advancement. </p></reply>

The purpose of this system is to provide the UN with a dynamic up to date catalogue of trained and available forces to draw from when establishing or reinforcing a UN mission.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has pledged personnel and equipment capabilities under PCRS.  In addition, in response to current and emerging uniformed capability requirements for UN peacekeeping, Ireland has pledged and delivered training in Ireland and overseas, for troop contributing country personnel deploying to UN missions.</p>  <p>  Since the White Paper was published, we have also had an actual Naval Service deployment on an overseas operation.  Between 2015 and 2017, the Naval Service deployed ships to 'Operation Pontus', a humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, and between 2017 and 2018, the Naval Service participated in the EU mission, EUNAVFORMED, Operation Sophia also in the Mediterranean, which was primarily a security and surveillance mission. </p>  <p>  Given current priorities, the finalisation of this project has been deferred to allow us to bed in the new UN PCRS system and also respond to the UN priorities for peacekeeping training where we are actively engaged in supporting Troop Contributing Countries in the Sahel as an additional tasking.  The changing nature of demands and potential future mission profiles will also need to be considered in the context of the assets and capabilities which can be made available by the Defence Forces for overseas deployment, given existing operational demands at home and overseas.  </p></reply>

These committees comprise of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland.  All proposals are vetted and agreed by the Defence Enterprise Committee to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government and where collaboration with industry/ third-level institutes will support Defence Forces capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces, in turn, support Irish enterprise and research institutes, including third level colleges, through the provision of resources and expertise to areas of new technology or research, which have the potential to contribute to the development and enhancement of Defence Forces crisis management capabilities. Under this initiative, the Defence Forces are currently supporting a range of projects that cover research, training and innovation with Irish indigenous companies and Research Institutes.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government approval, the primary focus of these engagements was in relation to projects under the European Defence Agency and civilian or dual-use security type projects under Horizon 2020.  </p>  <p>  Under the 2015 White Paper on Defence,  three projects were launched in relation to the Defence enterprise  and innovation.  The establishment of the Security and Defence Enterprise Group forms part of these projects.   A joint Civil Military Project Team has been established to progress these projects as part of an overall programme.  A number of the essential building blocks have been put in place to support this project and the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are now engaging with the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation and with Enterprise Ireland in relation to best approach for engagement with industry and research institutes which includes the establishment of the Security and Defence Enterprise Group.   </p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of peacekeeping and crisis management missions is a key policy requirement. While each mission has elements of danger, it is the Government's position that all actions should be taken to minimise threats to the safety of personnel. Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The White Paper identified the procurement of a small number of armoured logistics vehicles for overseas missions as a force protection requirement. A contract valued at some &euro;6m (ex VAT) was awarded to an Irish company, Westward Scania, in 2017 for the provision of 10 new armoured logistic vehicles for the Defence Forces, in order to provide combat service support personnel with the requisite force protection to operate in a supporting role in high threat environments. The vehicles were delivered in 2018 and are in operational service. The procurement of these vehicles also enhances Ireland's ability to participate in integrated multinational deployments. </p>  <p>  Further investment in armoured vehicles continues with a multi-year mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers which is underway, this programme of works will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired for the Defence Forces in 2017. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. </p></reply>

A key ongoing challenge for the RDF is to recruit personnel.  A total of 66 new recruits have been inducted to the RDF to date in 2019. Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members.  PDF recruit exit interviews now contain information on applying for membership of the RDF. </p><p>Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a Specialist Reserve.  A gap analysis of skills sets in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) will identify potential roles for Reserve members who possess specialist skills.  Options to develop the First Line Reserve are also currently being examined.  </p><p>The assignment of responsibility of Director of Reserve Defence Forces to the Director of Combat Support and ISTAR  has allowed for the provision of guidance, across all units and formations with RDF assets, in developing their capabilities.  This is in line with the single force concept and the role of the Reserve as described in the White Paper on Defence.  The focus will be to harness RDF skills and talent, maximising its development on the basis of mutual engagement with the PDF.  Specific project areas will focus on training, regulation, recruitment, retention and promotions and will be supported through RDF and PDF reciprocal training, mentoring and education. </p></reply>

The Government also agreed an extensive implementation plan for the report. </p>  <p>  The implementation plan is arranged around three broad themes of valuing members of the PDF, retaining the best people and attracting the best people.

An intermediate drydock is carried out between two and a half (2.5) and three (3) years.  A full drydock is carried out at five (5) years. </p>  <p>  Naval Service ships which are beyond their originally projected 30 year asset life, are drydocked for inspection every year, in order to manage ageing hull risk.</p>  <p>  In addition to the planned maintenance (drydocking and refits) carried out on all vessels, there is a requirement to upgrade and refurbish vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology. This is referred to as a Mid-Life Extension Programme and these works aim to extend the life of a vessel and address obsolescence. The Mid-Life Extension Programme of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n commenced in March 2019, with an initial dry-docking phase, followed by an extended period of equipment upgrade and refit works. L&Eacute; Niamh&rsquo;s extension programme is due to commence in 2020.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this capital maintenance programme, Naval Service Ships are required to undertake planned routine and non-routine maintenance on plant and machinery every day, 365 days a year, regardless of whether the ship is on patrol, undertaking Maritime Defence and Security Operations or alongside the Naval Base off patrol.</p>  <p>  These works are carried out to ensure the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that they can carry out their roles as assigned by Government.</p>  <p>  Detailed maintenance and drydocking schedules have not been provided for operational defence and security reasons. </p></reply>

The primary aim of Ireland's PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO. </p>  <p>   Ireland participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which is a mechanism for planning and capability development for Defence Forces deployment on peace support operations that allows for external review of defence capability and provision.  PARP is based on a biennial cycle which defines priority areas, elaborates mutually agreed planning targets known as PARP goals, identifies the steps required to meet those targets and jointly reviews progress in implementing them.  The cyclical nature of the PARP process along with the further assistance received from NATO in providing their experience to Defence Forces capacity and capability ensures on-going development in our Defence Forces based on the current and ever changing security environment.  Ireland completed it's PARP assessment process in June this year.</p>  <p>   The PARP assessment is based on an analysis of a number of predetermined goals, of which some are now considered implemented with the capabilities being maintained, some are fully completed, and some are currently being implemented.  Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in Partnership for Peace has delivered significant improvements for our Defence Forces in terms of capability development and operational capacity. This has enabled us to make a positive impact, particularly in undertaking more demanding international crisis management operations.</p>  <p>   In tandem with the recent PARP review, given that this year marks the 20th anniversary of Ireland's participation in PfP, a review of the scope and effectiveness of Ireland's engagement in PfP has been initiated by the Department of Defence in association with colleagues in the Defence Forces and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The purpose of this review is to ensure that Ireland is getting full value from our PfP engagement, including on interoperability and capability development, given the changing nature of the security environment and the threats faced.  This review has included meetings at senior official level with NATO staff and a more expansive and in-depth engagement between the Department, the Defence Forces, and the NATO International Staff who conduct the biennial PARP reviews.  It is expected that this review will be completed later this year.  </p>  <p>   The PARP assessment documents contain confidential information.  The documents have not been published to-date and it is not my intention to depart from the standing practice of not publishing the PARP documents.  A report and assessment on the feedback from the recent engagement with the NATO International Staff on the PARP process and on capabilities should be finalised in the coming months and I will consider the report and its conclusions at that stage.  </p></reply>

I was pleased to be able to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Group on 16 January 2019.  The Implementation Group went on to hold its first working meeting on 3 April 2019 and is scheduled to meet again in October.</p>  <p>  A second commitment of the National Plan was a comprehensive baseline assessment of the legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland. My Department commissioned independent consultants to carry out this research in 2018, the final report of which is available on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  At its meeting in April the Implementation Group considered the findings of the baseline assessment and the establishment of three sub-groups, each tasked with prioritising and delivering key actions under the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles, namely, the State duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect and access to remedy. The composition and chair of these sub-groups has been considered by the Implementation Group and the establishment of the groups and the appointment of the chairs is a priority for my Department. It is anticipated that the sub-groups will be constituted and will begin work before the next plenary meeting of the Group in October 2019. </p></reply>

Libya, like all other countries, must manage migration in full compliance with international law. This is a matter primarily for the Libyan Government, which bears the responsibility and has the presence on the ground, rather than for external actors such as the EU.</p>  <p>  The EU is maintaining its political pressure on the Libyan authorities to end the system of detention centres. For example, when the EU High Representative met with the Prime Minister of Libya and the UN Special Representative for Libya in February, she raised conditions in detention centres. Ireland and the EU will continue to raise this issue at every appropriate opportunity. </p>  <p>  The EU is also working to ensure that other options exist to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants, by supporting the work of UNHCR and IOM, and I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Libya today with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Filippo Grandi. In December 2018, the Libyan authorities agreed to the opening of the UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility, as a hub to help refugees and asylum seekers to be swiftly evacuated. This is only a temporary solution for particularly vulnerable groups, including those who have been evacuated from detention centres near conflict areas. The EU will continue to work with the UN agencies, the Libyan authorities and others to find sustainable alternatives to the system of detention. </p>  <p>  Through our cooperation with the UN and the African Union, the EU has also helped over 45,000 migrants stranded in Libya to return voluntarily to their countries of origin, and has evacuated close to 4,000 persons in need of international protection. Since many more people remain at risk, the EU will continue to work with its partners to relocate them to safe places swiftly to receive assistance.</p>  <p>  I welcome reports from UNHCR this week that the Libyan Government has decided to release migrants and refugees from Tajoura detention centre, which was struck in a horrific attack earlier this month. I understand that the majority of migrants and refugees decided to leave the detention centre, and are being provided with support by the UNHCR. This is a positive development, but of course it comes too late for those who lost their lives in the attack. I call on the Libyan authorities to continue to cooperate with UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies to empty all the migrant detention centres in Libya as soon as possible, and in line with their responsibilities under international law.</p>  <p>  Efforts to ensure the wellbeing of refugees and migrants in Libya remain constrained by the current security and political situation there. Libya is in the midst of a civil war and conflict there has severely limited the capacity of the international community to monitor and influence events on the ground. The EU Delegation to Libya had to be relocated to Tunisia, and most EU Member States with Embassies in Libya had to close these, due to the growing security threat. There is also a governance vacuum in many parts of the country, and access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted in many areas. Governments need counterparts, if we are to exert pressure &ndash; counterparts which are actually in control of the territory where abuses happen. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants and refugees in Libya will require restoration of political stability and an end to lawlessness in Libya. This requires the formation of a fully functioning and unified Government, and a return to order throughout the country. The UN Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute; is working to achieve this. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions. In the meantime, we will maintain pressure on all parties to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian organisations to improve conditions in detention centres, to increase alternatives to detention, and, ultimately, to put an end to the system of detention in Libya.</p></reply>

During their visit, the President, An Taoiseach, myself and a number of Ministers engaged with the representatives of the island nations and discussed Ireland&rsquo;s values and our shared commitment to the multilateral system.

The year one detailed Progress Report was published concurrently with the summit and is available on www.gov.ie</p>  <p>  To date new Embassies have opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia and Santiago de Chile, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Mumbai and Cardiff. This brings to 88 the number of diplomatic Missions in the network. The expansion will continue this year to include new Consulates General in Los Angeles and Frankfurt.

We continue to make progress in increasing the number of officers in missions that currently have one or two officers. </p>  <p>  We have sought to deepen our engagement with the multilateral system with the launch last July of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Officials from my Department both at home and abroad have been actively presenting Ireland&rsquo;s case and seeking support among the other 192 UN Member States. This has provided Ireland with an invaluable opportunity to build relationships and contacts across the world, which will stand to us long after the campaign has ended. </p>  <p>  In October we obtained observer status at the Organisation of the Francophonie &ndash; an important step in increasing our engagement with the French speaking world. </p>  <p>  More recently I launched a new strategy for the US and Canada and a White Paper on International Development Policy. Work is underway on strategies for Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the Asia Pacific Region. And a series of consultations are also underway for a new Diaspora policy. </p>  <p>  A critical component of the Global Ireland programme is identifying new opportunities to diversify our markets in a post-Brexit world. &euro;8 million was allocated in budget 2019 to support the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise development network internationally. This investment will allow for a more targeted expansion of our State Agencies in both emerging and established international markets.  </p>  <p>   In my Department planning is underway for Ireland&rsquo;s participation at Expo 2020 in Dubai. Expo will showcase Ireland to a global audience, in a region with huge trade and investment potential and will support a 'Team Ireland' approach to promoting Ireland as a global partner for the development of new ideas and technologies, as well as an attractive location for business and investment.</p></reply>

A no deal Brexit will have severe economic and political implications for Ireland, North and South. The process of engagement with the European Commission, with its twin objectives of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it and at least avoiding physical infrastructure at the border on the island of Ireland, continues.  </p>  <p>  I have spoken with my EU counterparts about this work, and made clear that in addressing the border, Ireland is committed to protecting the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. Our place in the Single Market is a vital part of our economic model and crucial to Ireland's prosperity. </p>  <p>  EU partners have repeatedly made clear the EU&rsquo;s solidarity with Ireland on this issue. The EU has been clear that it is determined to do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect the peace process.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, any such arrangements in a no deal scenario will be temporary and will be sub-optimal compared to the backstop. This is why the backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and why we remain focussed on securing its ratification. As Michel Barnier has stated, it provides a &ldquo;solution which preserves, on the one hand, the integrity of the United Kingdom and on the other, the Single Market, while respecting what we have committed to respect: the Good Friday Agreement.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process will not disappear in a no deal scenario. We, with our EU partners, will insist that the issue of the border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement will need to be resolved as a condition for opening wider negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.325.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100062#WRF05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 133, 138 and 154 together.</p>  <p>  Let me state clearly at the outset that the Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly Brexit is for the UK to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed by the UK Government and endorsed by the European Council. However, given the ongoing political uncertainty in the UK, it is our assessment that there is a significant risk of a no deal Brexit on 31 October. While we continue to plan for all scenarios, work on no deal Brexit preparations has the highest priority across Government departments and State agencies.</p>  <p>  Following its approval by the Government, the updated Brexit Contingency Action Plan was laid before the Oireachtas and published on Tuesday 9 July. Its contents will be debated in detail in this House today. The Contingency Action Plan reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis to prepare for a no deal Brexit, including by setting out the next steps to be taken between now and 31 October. </p>  <p>  At EU level, there is agreement on a range of temporary contingency measures in key areas, including maintaining basic air connectivity and road haulage access between the EU and the UK in the event of a no deal Brexit. These measures have been undertaken in tandem with our ongoing engagement with our EU partners and with the European Commission, on key outstanding issues, including on potential supports for Ireland and affected sectors. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Government's work to reduce delays at ports and disruptions to supply chains, additional infrastructure has been put in place to manage the necessary checks and controls on our trade with the UK on an east-west basis post-Brexit.  Work at Dublin Port has involved nine projects across eight sites to deliver 13 new inspection bays, documentary and identity check facilities, office facilities and parking for up to 128 heavy goods vehicles. Plans are in place for a further 18 inspection bays. A 24-hour service will be provided at Dublin Port, and extended hours to match arrival times will be provided at Rosslare Port with on-call service provision outside these hours. </p>  <p>  Revenue accelerated and expanded recruitment and training schedules to meet the 12 April 2019 deadline, with an additional 400 staff trained and ready by that date. Revenue will continue to build on this and will have 450 additional staff in place by 31 October. Additional staff recruited in preparation for Brexit are deployed across a number of functions, with approximately half on import and export trade facilitation activities. Revenue will continue to monitor the need for further recruitment, deployment and training. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) had approximately 190 staff ready to carry out import controls and export certification on 12 April 2019. Further staff will be ready to carry out controls in the additional inspection facilities that will be available by 31 October. </p>  <p>  The HSE had 59 staff trained and available to conduct no deal Brexit (import and export) activities in time for the 12 April deadline. The HSE is progressing recruitment for a further intake of staff before the end of October. </p>  <p>  Revenue are confident that their IT systems will handle the increased transaction levels in a no deal scenario. DAFM&rsquo;s necessary IT systems were in place by March 2019. </p>  <p>  As stated in the Action Plan, there should be no illusion - a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications. Our need to prepare prudently is more pressing than ever. Citizens and businesses cannot assume that because a no deal Brexit was averted in March and April that the same will happen in October. </p>  <p>  The time between now and the extended Article 50 deadline of 31 October must therefore be used wisely and effectively, by exposed businesses in particular, on increased preparedness measures. It is only by Government, business and citizens working together, both nationally and with our EU partners, that we can aim to mitigate, as far as possible, the impacts of a no deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  We are determined to be as prepared as we can be, deal or no deal, for the changes Brexit will bring. We will continue this work as a fully committed EU Member State and with the unwavering solidarity and support of our EU partners.</p></reply>

I accompanied President Higgins to number of meetings where there were  discussions on Brexit, including with the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier; the Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel; and the Minister of State for Europe at the Federal Foreign Office, Michael Roth. </p>  <p>  In addition, I had a bilateral meeting with the Minister of European and Federal Affairs of the State of Hessen, Ms. Lucia Puttrich, where I briefed the Minister on Brexit issues. During the State Visit events, I also met with a number of Bundestag parliamentarians and took the opportunity to informally discuss Brexit with them as well.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate Germany&rsquo;s unwavering support in the Article 50 negotiations, including clear support for an operational and legally sound backstop to avoid a hard border. This solidarity was reaffirmed last week during the State Visit when President Steinmeier stated that Ireland's core interests are and will remain the EU's core interests. </p></reply>

The corresponding 2018 capital allocation, in the first year of Project Ireland 2040/National Development Plan 2018-2027 was &euro;13 million. </p><p>The main focus of capital investment in 2019, as was also the case in 2018, is on the cost of constructing and maintaining State properties overseas under Global Ireland 2025, the on-going Passport Reform Programme, Ireland&rsquo;s participation at EXPO 2020 and the continuing investment in ICT to support the Department&rsquo;s global ICT network.</p><p>The projected breakdown of the 2019 capital allocation of &euro;21 million, across the various areas referred to above, is as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>2019 </th></tr><tr><td>State properties overseas</td><td>&euro;8.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Passport Reform Programme</td><td>&euro;5.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>EXPO 2020</td><td>&euro;4.0 million</td></tr><tr><td>ICT </td><td>&euro;3.0 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;21 million </td></tr></table></p><p>Insofar as the current and future budgets for State properties overseas is concerned, details of the major current projects follow. It is planned to complete building works in 2019 at the Permanent Mission to the UN in New York at a total cost of &euro;5.6 million. This project will be completed on budget. Preliminary works continue to facilitate the construction of a new Embassy/Ireland House in Tokyo for which a site was purchased in 2017 for &euro;7.7 million. This project is currently under tender for design and management with construction tendering expected to be completed in 2020. The estimated construction cost for this project is &euro;16 million.  Tendering for the construction of new Chancery and Official Accommodation buildings in Abuja, Nigeria, is expected to take place in 2020. In 2018, the Department purchased a building for &euro;3.7 million for an expansion of the Washington D.C. Chancery. This project is still under development. </p><p>Under the on-going Passport Reform Programme, the main projects due for completion in 2019 will be the automated mailing project, the business process automation project, the bedding-in of the improvements to the on-line renewals service, on-going improvement to customer systems, and the commencement of the Passport Integrated Processing System. The overall budget for the Passport Reform Programme of &euro;21.4 million, for the period 2015-2021, is on target, in line with the business case.</p><p>An allocation of &euro;4 million in 2019 is provided for building costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EXPO 2020 in Dubai.  Ireland&rsquo;s national Pavilion is being designed by the Office of Public Works.  The total capital cost of the pavilion will be &euro;5 million and is expected to come in on budget. EXPO 2020 is expected to attract some 25 million visitors.  In a competitive global environment, participation will promote increased awareness of Ireland in the UAE and other key markets as a place to do business and as a destination for FDI post-Brexit.  Ireland&rsquo;s presence will also aim to support trade and tourism opportunities for Ireland in the UAE and wider Gulf region.</p><p>For 2019 there are also smaller planned capital projects in respect of ICT Services comprising infrastructure upgrades, rollout of new business systems and improved communications technology. Provision is also being made for ICT services to new Missions under Global Ireland 2025.</p></reply>

We have called on China to allow meaningful, unsupervised and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant UN Special Procedures mandate holders. </p>  <p>  At a bilateral level, I discussed the subject with China's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Wang Chao, during political consultations held in Dublin last year. Ireland's concerns about the situation in Xinjiang are also raised in our contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing. </p>  <p>  As I have noted in this House previously, the EU had a detailed discussion with China during the most recent EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in April 2019. During the discussion, the EU stressed that, while actions to counter terrorism are essential, such measures must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms and international laws. The issue was also raised during the EU-China Summit in the same month. </p>  <p>  In the multilateral context, the EU has consistently raised concerns about the situation in Xinjiang in recent sessions of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), including the 41st Session of the Council which is currently underway in Geneva. </p>  <p>  Ireland and a significant number of EU Member States participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in November 2018. Ireland urged China to respect freedom of religion and belief and recommended that China grant access to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to all regions of the country, including Xinjiang.  </p>  <p>   We will continue to raise these issues in the future, in both bilateral and multilateral forums.</p></reply>

On a political level, we already cooperate closely through a number of institutions, most notably the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council, both of which are institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>The British Irish Intergovernmental Conference was established to deal with &ldquo;the totality of relationships&rdquo; between these islands and to promote bilateral cooperation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of the two sovereign Governments. It provides an important opportunity to consider the East West relationship and a forum to discuss important issues, as the agenda of the last meeting reflected, including political developments in Northern Ireland, East-West economic cooperation, security cooperation, issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and issues of rights and citizenship. There have been three meetings of the Conference over the past year, in London last July, in Dublin in November and again in London on 8 May last.<b></b></p><p>For its part, the British-Irish Council brings together the Irish and UK Governments, the Devolved Administrations in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh,  as well as representatives of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The Council continues to work on areas of shared importance, with the Taoiseach and Minister Bruton attending the most recent Summit meeting in Manchester two weeks ago.</p><p>There are also strong inter-parliamentary relations maintained and developed through the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA), which brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, the UK Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish and Welsh devolved Assemblies, as well as the representative assemblies for the Channel Islands and  the Isle of Man. Three of the four BIPA Committees have carried out inquiries into the consequences of the UK exit from the EU for various sectors across this island, meeting with practitioners and stakeholders to hear evidence and further the discourse around this issue of primary importance.</p><p>However, notwithstanding the important work of these Institutions, there is a real danger that, post-Brexit, our two countries could lose the habit of cooperation that we have developed working side by side in EU institutions since 1973. Therefore, we will need to work hard to protect and develop our relationship as close neighbours and good friends. </p><p>That is why, at last November's British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, we discussed a joint paper outlining a possible model to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between Ireland and the UK post-Brexit. </p><p>As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving the Taoiseach and Prime Minister and senior Irish and UK Ministers. These summits would be supported by close bilateral work at both political and official levels. </p><p>This commitment was reaffirmed at the most recent BIIGC, held in May this year, and officials on both sides have commenced the process of turning these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation.</p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in London remains our largest bilateral Embassy globally, and has had additional staff assigned to it since the Brexit vote to reflect the fact that our relationship with the UK is such a high priority. Our Consulate in Edinburgh continues to be very active, and our Consulate in Cardiff has reopened in recent months. Our Global Ireland policy contains a pledge to open an additional consulate in another British location post-2019. &lsquo;Team Ireland&rsquo; also enjoys a significant footprint in Britain with our trade, tourism, and investment agencies continuing to make a positive impact. </p><p>I am therefore confident that these existing structures and proposed new arrangements will provide ample opportunity for positive engagement between our two Governments into the future.</p></reply>

Central to our approach is the commitment to double our impact in the region by 2025.  </p>  <p>  In support of that ambitious target, significant work has already been undertaken, including the opening of Ireland&rsquo;s first resident mission to New Zealand in Wellington, which opened in November 2018, and Ireland's first Consulate General in Mumbai, India, which opened in March 2019. Further new Missions are envisaged to open under the strategy, including Ireland's first resident Mission to the Philippines in 2020, and a third consulate in China before 2025. These new Missions will take to 17 the number of Irish Embassies and Consulates in this fast-growing and important region, which is home to over 4 billion people.  </p>  <p>  In line with the expansion of our physical Mission network, there has been a drive to increase our human presence on-the-ground. Including both posted diplomats and local support staff, there has been an 8% increase in the headcount in our Embassies and Consulates in Asia Pacific between 2017 and 2018. This is expected to grow further as new Missions are opened, and further deepening of our existing network takes place. In addition to the work underway in my own Department, the State Agencies have also invested heavily in their Asia Pacific presence, both expanding their network with new offices in Shenzhen, Ho Chi Minh, Tokyo and Melbourne, and reinforcement of existing offices in the region. </p>  <p>  In support of our aim to double our impact by 2025, we have also increased the money available to missions in the region through a doubling of the Asia Pacific Regional Fund (APRF) to &euro;480,000 in 2019. The APRF focused on activities which build awareness of Ireland and promote our values, and for public diplomacy and visibility raising initiatives. Projects this year include a media and film industry trip to Ireland from Beijing, Bloomsday celebrations in Shanghai, a Women in STEAM event in Jakarta and research into perceptions and awareness of Ireland in Japan.</p>  <p>  To guide and shape our future engagement with countries in the region, the Government will publish the whole-of-Government Asia Pacific Strategy in the Autumn. This strategy will detail how we will develop long-term strategic relationships, build stronger two-way economic partnerships, share our culture and engage our diaspora and increase our visibility in the region.</p></reply>

Further engagement is planned in the coming months with a view to rolling out ambitious targets and actions across the Department before the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  In addition and in recognition of the increasing threat posed by climate change the Government in its new policy for international development, A Better World, places climate action as one of its four main policy priorities. The policy commits Ireland to increasing its international engagement on climate change particularly with those most affected by its impact.</p></reply>

Therefore, year on year figures previously presented in PQ 4480/18 have adjusted slightly in accordance with this new reporting methodology.</p><p>The NTMA bills each delegated State authority on a monthly basis. This billing process is based on the amount paid out by the SCA in the previous month on all claims which are being actively managed and finalised and relates to damages, legal costs (agency and plaintiff) and other expert costs. </p><p>Under the NTMA, the SCA is responsible for making decisions in relation to the management of all aspects of the claims under their remit. Where the State is liable, the SCA endeavours to settle claims expeditiously and economically. In cases which involve contributory and/or third party negligence, the SCA endeavours to settle such claims on appropriate and reasonable terms. In cases where liability is fully disputed, claims are contested using appropriate resources e.g. State and expert witnesses, all relevant documents/records (i.e. training, checklists, photos, etc.).</p><p>The SCA, in accordance with Section 16 of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2000, uses the Post Office Savings Bank to fund claims costs and expenses. As payments are made on claims for damages, legal costs and other expert costs, the SCA seeks reimbursements of these from each delegated State authority so it can in turn refund the Post Office Bank account.</p><p>In relation to the General Indemnity and Clinical Indemnity Schemes, the SCA does not retain individual claims portfolio funds.</p></reply>

While implementation of the Roadmap is primarily a matter for my colleague, Ms Regina Doherty T.D., the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and her Department, the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) was allocated a number of specific measures.  The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from this Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Revenue, and the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Strand 3 of the Roadmap is concerned with improving the governance and regulation of supplementary pensions to, among other things, achieve scale, improve standards, and simplify the provisions of pensions.  The actions allocated to the IDPRTG under the Roadmap derive in the main from Strand 3, and the terms of reference of the Group reflects this focus.</p>  <p>  Action 3.14 commits to &lsquo;Undertake a broad review of the utilisation of the ARF option and consider whether regulatory oversight of this product is fit for purpose'. Officials from my Department have examined submissions from interested parties, as part of the IDPRTG&rsquo;s work in reviewing the utilisation of the ARF product.</p>  <p>  The IDPRTG&rsquo;s work on the review of ARFs is still underway and the Group hope to finalise their work and report to me on these matters shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.400.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100063#WRG05700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159, 160, 196, 199, 215 and 216 together.</p><p>In relation to question 30734and in the context of extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work across all Government Departments and Agencies, Revenue determined that in a &lsquo;Central Case&rsquo; scenario (i.e. an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period until the end of 2020), an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required.</p><p>In September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. </p><p>Budget 2019 provided Revenue with an additional &euro;10 million pay provision, for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019, to manage an orderly UK withdrawal. Following a Government Decision in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment programme in preparation for Brexit. </p><p>In the period from 2017 to date, I am advised that Revenue has assigned over 450 additional staff to customs related roles, deployed across a range of functions, with the majority assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities and policy and operational roles. Resources are deployed based on evolving business needs and to tackle any risks as they emerge. Revenue will continue to adjust its recruitment and training plans in response to business needs, including Brexit-related developments. </p><p>With regard to question 30735  , I am advised by Revenue that the EU Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme, aims to enhance international supply chain security and to facilitate legitimate trade and is open to all Irish businesses who are involved in making Customs declarations. </p><p>There is no legal obligation for businesses to become an AEO in order to trade with the UK post-Brexit. While there are benefits to AEO there are also obligations, so a decision to apply for AEO is a matter for careful consideration by each business based on a full assessment of its supply chain and operating model. Full details of the AEO programme are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that in 2018, 30 of the 42 applications for AEO status were received by Revenue in the second half of that year and the increased interest in AEO has continued in 2019 with 82 applications to date.</p><p>The breakdown for each of the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019 is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>AEO Applications</th><th>AEO Authorisations Granted</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>22</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>13</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>16</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>42</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2019 to date (09/07/19)</td><td>82</td><td>46</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to questions 30983 and 31361  , Revenue identifies businesses that trade with the UK by analysing the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) data. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is currently analysing VIES data from 2018 which has identified approximately 92,000 businesses having traded with the UK in 2018. On further examination of the data, Revenue identified that approximately 70% (65,000) of these businesses do not currently hold an EORI number. </p><p>Details of the value of trade with the UK in 2018 for the approximate 65,000 businesses who do not have an EORI number is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Value of Trade</th><th>Number of Businesses (approximately in each category).</th></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;&euro;1M</td><td>250 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100K-&euro;1M</td><td>2,600</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;50k - &euro;100K</td><td>2,800</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;5K &ndash; &euro;50K  </td><td>19,000</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt; &euro;5K </td><td>*</td></tr></table></p><p>* Revenue is continuing its analysis of data in order to establish the number of businesses that had only one transaction or a minimal level of transactions in the year.</p><p>Revenue pointed out that for businesses that may have had only a once off transaction or infrequent trade with the UK, it may be that such transactions and trade are not expected to arise post Brexit. It is a matter for each business to assess its supply chain in the context of Brexit and determine what steps it needs to take to be prepared.</p><p>Revenue advised that acquiring an EORI number is the minimum requirement for businesses that wish to trade with, or through, the UK when they leave the EU.  It is a simple and free online process which is available on a 24-hour basis. Once a business is registered with the Revenue Online Service (ROS), the turnaround time for Revenue to process an EORI number application is approximately 3 minutes. </p><p>Details of the number of EORI registrations applied for and issued since 2017 is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of EORI   Registrations</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,595</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2,976</td></tr><tr><td>2019 to date**</td><td>7,128</td></tr></table></p><p>**reflect figures up to 8 July 2019</p><p>Revenue continue to encourage businesses that have not yet applied for an EORI number and who will need one post Brexit to do so as a matter of urgency. In that regard I am advised that Revenue will be in direct contact with such businesses over the coming weeks. Once businesses have acquired an EORI number they need to continue their preparations to ensure they avoid significant delays in moving goods to, from or across the UK. At a minimum, every business should have the facility to make customs declarations or have plans in place for a customs agent to do so; know the origin and Commodity Code of their goods or products, and talk to the person who transports their goods or products to make sure they have the information they need to be able to move those goods or products.</p><p>In relation to question 31360  , I am advised by Revenue that it estimates that there will be an increase in customs declarations from current levels of approximately 1.6m per annum to over 20 million per annum post-Brexit. Consequently, a key priority for Revenue has been to upgrade the relevant IT systems to ensure that it can cater for this potential volume increase in the post-Brexit environment and to work with the relevant software providers in supporting their preparedness for Brexit.</p><p>In Budget 2017, I included provision for a &euro;2 million investment in scaling up the Revenue customs IT framework. As a result of this, Revenue carried out significant work to increase systems capacity to cater for trade with the UK as a third country.  I am advised by Revenue that robust stress and performance testing has taken place to ensure their systems will have capacity to cater for the volumes and the impact on the systems, particularly at peak times. This upgrading was completed prior to 31 March 2019 and I am advised by Revenue that it is confident that the IT systems will handle the increased declaration levels in a no-deal scenario.</p><p>I am further advised that Revenue has engaged directly with software providers and customs agents to ensure these key players are aware of the requirements in the post-Brexit environment.</p></reply>

The total amount lodged to the Escrow Fund was circa &euro;14.285 billion (representing the principal amount and relevant EU interest). This represents the full amount of the alleged State Aid and no further such payments will be made into the Escrow Fund. </p><p>The Department of Finance recently published the financial statements for the Escrow Fund for 2018 which are available at the following link &ndash;</p><p><i></i></p><p>The financial statements illustrate that the net assets of the Escrow Fund as at 31 December 2018 totalled &euro;14.269 billion, representing a decline in value of &euro;16 million. This decline in value for the Escrow Fund reflects the current negative interest rate environment as illustrated by the consistent negative official ECB Overnight Deposit rate (-0.4%) and negative yields on highly rated euro-sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds. </p><p>The arrangements in the Escrow Framework Deed include the agreement that all claims of ownership and access to this money is suspended until the European Courts have concluded the proceedings that the Government and Apple have brought. In general terms, all income/expenses, including any gains or losses will accrue to the Escrow Fund. The final proceeds of the Escrow Fund at the conclusion of the entire legal process, will be returned to Apple or paid to the State depending on the final determination over the validity of the Commission's Decision in the European Courts. As this process is expected to take a number of years, it is not possible to determine what the value of the Escrow Fund might be at that point in time.</p></reply>

The establishment of the FSPO resulted from the merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Bureau.  </p><p>Under section 15(4) of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 the Ombudsman may appoint staff to his office and determine their duties with the approval of the Minister for Finance and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) commissioned a Workforce Plan 2019-2023 and submitted the Plan to my Department.  This plan includes an analysis of the level of resources currently available to the FSPO against both current and predicted future demand for his services.It also addressed the large existing caseload which the Office inherited on 01 January 2018, along with the sustained pattern of increased demand which the office continues to experience.  </p><p>Following consideration of the Plan I sanctioned an additional 35 staff for the Office as follows:-<table><tr><th></th><th>Assistant Principal</th><th>Higher Executive Officer</th><th>Executive Officer</th><th>Clerical Officer</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Additional Posts Sanctioned </td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>35</td></tr></table></p><p>These additional resources will allow the FSPO to deliver a better faster service for its customers, keep pace with the speed of change, tackle existing waiting times, and deliver the objectives in its Strategic Plan 2018 &ndash; 2021.</p><p>Recruitment campaigns were advertised in May 2019, for the grades of Executive Officer and Higher Executive Officer, and the recruitment processes for these campaigns are currently ongoing.  Priority is being given to the filling of vacancies at HEO and EO levels within the following functional areas: </p><p>- Dispute Resolution/Mediation</p><p>- Investigation/Adjudication/Legal Services</p><p>Once the outcome of the current recruitment processes is clear, additional recruitment will be undertaken in Q3 and Q4 2019, which will also include competitions at the grades of Assistant Principal and Clerical Officer. </p><p>On the issue more generally,  in 2018 and to date in 2019 the Ombudsman has informed me that vacancies which arose have been filled, either through existing panels where possible or else through the establishment of new panels by way of additional recruitment campaigns.</p><p>I should add that the post of Deputy Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman is vacant since April 2019 and work is currently underway to arrange the filling of this post. </p></reply>

The establishment of the FSPO resulted from the merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Bureau.  </p><p>I understand that the Office of the FSPO was in contact with the Deputy and this answer reflects their agreement on the format of the response.</p><p>The following table outlines the number of staff employed by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman at the end of its first year in operation, i.e. 31 December 2018: <table><tr><th>Number  of Staff by Grade</th><th>Staff in position 31.12.2018</th></tr><tr><td>Ombudsman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Ombudsman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Principal Officer</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive   Officer</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer</td><td>3.2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>49.2</td></tr></table></p><p>A Workforce Plan for the period 2019 to 2023 was submitted to the Department of Finance in December 2018, which included an objective analysis of the level of resources currently available to the FSPO against both current and future demand for its services. The Workforce Plan aims to address the large existing caseload which the Office inherited on 01 January 2018, along with the sustained pattern of increased demand which the office continues to experience. </p><p>Following a review of this work force plan, I approved the recruitment of a further 35 staff at the following levels:</p><p>5 Assistant Principal</p><p>11 Higher Executive Officer</p><p>15 Executive Officer</p><p>4 Clerical Officer </p><p>The following table outlines the number of staff employed by the Financial Services and Pensions at the end of its Q2 2019, i.e. 30 June 2019, compared to the approved staff number: <table><tr><th>Number of Staff by Grade</th><th>Approved Staffing 2019</th><th>Staff in position at 30.06.2019</th></tr><tr><td>Ombudsman</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Ombudsman</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Principal Officer</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive   Officer</td><td>22</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer</td><td>42</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer</td><td>10.2</td><td>9.6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>90.2</td><td>61.6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.439.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100064#WRH02600"><p>As part of its Annual Report for 2018, NAMA recently revised its projected surplus to be returned to the State to &euro;4 billion subject to market conditions prevailing. The realisation of this surplus also depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  Based on the end 2018 projected surplus NAMA has estimated a entity return on investment (EROI) of 37%. The EROI benchmark is calculated based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the participating institutions as part of the loan acquisition price. NAMA&rsquo;s EROI target benchmark, as approved by its Board in 2014, is 20%. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this surplus has yet to fully crystallise and that the transfer of surplus funds to the Central Fund can only begin after NAMA's remaining subordinated debt and equity obligations have been repaid in full, which is expected to be in 2020.</p>  <p>  It is currently envisaged that the available surplus will be transferred to the Exchequer in 2020 and 2021. It is estimated that &euro;2 billion will be transferred in 2020 with a further &euro;2 billion being transferred in 2021. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged. </p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs. </p></reply>

No further data has become available in respect of these reliefs since 30 May.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the annual cost of the Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) tax credit and the number of companies that availed of it for years up to 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, is published on the Revenue website at the following link:</p><p>https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/tax-expenditures/r-and-d-tax-credits.aspx. </p><p>The available information in respect of multinational and SME companies is split between companies administered by Revenue&rsquo;s Large Corporates Division (LCD) and non-LCD companies. Most of the companies administered by LCD are multinational companies. Also shown is the distribution of the R&amp;amp;D claims by the number of employees of the claimant companies.</p><p>A review of the research and development tax credit is being undertaken by my Department in 2019. This review will examine the interaction of SMEs with the credit as part of its scope.</p><p>In relation to the Knowledge Development Box (KDB), the number of claimants and cost are published in Revenue&rsquo;s recent paper on 2018 Corporation Tax payments and 2017 tax returns, which is available on the Revenue website at link https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/ct-analysis-2019.pdf (Table 13 shows the KDB claims). Due to the small numbers of taxpayers claiming KDB, Revenue cannot comment further on the size of the claimant companies.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that a claimant company has a period of up to 24 months to make a claim for KDB relief. It is anticipated that companies will make use of the 24 month time frame available, therefore more claims in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 may be made by September 2019.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the ESRI produced research on the carbon tax in 2018, including on the distributional impacts of a once-off increase in the tax. The research found that households at all income levels will face similar percentage increases in consumer prices in the event of such an increase, but with the impact felt differing on the basis of the carbon intensity of the goods they consume and the ease with which households can switch their consumption. In the case of a &euro;5 increase in carbon tax, the research found that costs would increase by &euro;0.45 per week for the poorest households and by &euro;2.30 a week for the richest, reflecting the different consumption patterns experienced by these households. However, in terms of shares of income, the impacts on poorer households was found to be more than double that on richer households. For a &euro;5 increase, the poorest households will have to spend 0.16% more of their income to continue the same level of consumption (of all commodities), whereas the richest will have to spend 0.07% more.</p>  <p>  The model used in this research was limited to performing a static analysis and could not capture the impact of producers and consumers altering their behaviour in reaction to increases in the carbon tax. The next phase of this joint research work underway utilises a the more dynamic Ireland Environment-Energy-Economy (I3E) model which can examine phased increases in tax rates over time. As part of this work, the Department has also commissioned the ESRI to undertake an extension of the model to distinguish impacts by household income level and location. This research is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in advance of the budget so as to inform budgetary decisions on the carbon tax.        </p></reply>

It is payable in respect of all residential properties, subject to certain exemptions. It is administered by Revenue in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended. Liability for LPT arises where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and 1 November in the preceding year for subsequent years. For example, the liability date for 2019 is 1 November 2018.</p>  <p>  Revenue provides a wide range of phased and single payment options for LPT. The phased payment options include monthly direct debit through a financial institution, payment via deduction at source (DaS) from salary or pension and via approved payment service providers (An Post, Omnivend, Payzone). The single payment options include debit card, credit card, Annual Debit Instruction (ADI) and cheque.</p>  <p>  There are no additions to the amount of LPT due regardless of which payment option a property owner chooses. Therefore, Revenue does not generate any additional income as a result. </p>  <p>  Also, while Revenue does not apply any service fees, the financial institutions and approved payment service providers are commercial entities and do charge transaction fees.</p></reply>

For example, in 2016, the most recent year for which complete data are currently available, 454,700 taxpayers received tax relief on health expenses at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;131 million and 6,800 taxpayers received tax relief on nursing home fees, at a cost of &euro;33 million.</p><p>Regarding Question 30929-19, I am advised by Revenue that prior to the commencement of PAYE Modernisation on 1 January 2019 (2019 tax year onwards) the practice was that an End of Year Statement (P21) only issued on request from a taxpayer or where a taxpayer completed a Form 12 tax return. The approach ensured the taxpayer record was fully up to date prior to the P21 Statement being generated and avoided the possibility of an overpayment or underpayment being incorrectly reflected.</p><p>The commencement of PAYE Modernisation means that Revenue is now receiving real-time pay and statutory deductions information from employers/pension providers for their employees/pension recipients on or before each pay date. The availability of such real-time data will allow Revenue to automatically provide preliminary End of Year Statements to all employees/pension recipients each year, for example, the End of Year Statements in respect of 2019 will be available in early 2020. </p><p>The End of Year Statement will include the pay, tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) information for each employment/pension, as reported by the employer/pension provider, and will indicate if an over-deduction or under-deduction of tax and USC has occurred. The availability of the End of Year Statement will encourage taxpayers to claim any additional tax credits or reliefs, such as health expenses, or to declare any additional incomes, which can be done by completing a pre-populated Form 12 tax return. Once a taxpayer confirms that the End of Year Statement is correct, a P21 Statement will issue and any overpayments will be automatically refunded.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s innovative use of real-time information to streamline and simplify the PAYE process ensures that taxpayer records are fully up to-date and all employments, pensions, incomes, credits and entitlements accounted for before a final review is conducted and a P21 issued. It is hoped this simplified facility will encourage taxpayers to claim their entitlements and ensure as far as possible, that they pay the right amount of tax at the right time. </p><p>Finally, I commend Revenue for the very significant improvements it has made to the PAYE system and the efforts it has made to simplify the tax system for citizens. </p></reply>

The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 Act provides for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT registered traders importing goods from non-EU countries, which will be implemented if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement. The Act has been enacted and remains subject to commencement, until it is clear that the UK are exiting without an agreement.</p><p>Under the system of postponed accounting, importers will not pay import VAT at the point of entry, instead, importers will account for import VAT through their bi-monthly VAT return.  The VAT will therefore be reclaimed at the same time as it is declared in the VAT return.  </p><p>In a 'no deal' scenario, postponed accounting will be introduced for all traders for a limited period to alleviate immediate cash flow issues. Following an initial period, at a time to be decided by the Minister for Finance, continued use of the postponed accounting system will depend on fulfilling criteria which will be set by the Revenue Commissioners.The system of postponed accounting will not be mandatory and those traders who wish to pay VAT at point of entry, may continue to do so.</p><p>In the event of a no deal exit, exports to the UK will continue to be zero rated.</p></reply>

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability, and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 &lsquo;Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 &lsquo;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&rsquo;) to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: </p>  <p>1. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p>2. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65% to 100%, and  the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100% funding over the next number of years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, has prepared a public consultation paper on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020. This consultation, which has been published on the Department of Finance website, is open to all persons and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to submit feedback.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance I have reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and that since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo).</p></reply>

The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. Revenue has referenced the original scope of its zero rating concession but acknowledged that the scope had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including health and nutrition experts as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward are evidence based. Officials in my department are considering the submissions received and a report was submitted to the Tax Strategy Group on 9th July. The TSG papers are due to be published on my Department's website by the end of July. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.529.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100065#WRJ05300"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or businesses.</p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge the general problems faced by many consumers, businesses, and community and voluntary groups, in relation to the cost and availability of insurance.  I also appreciate that there is some frustration about the perceived pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.</p>  <p>  I wish to reemphasise how important this issue is for the Government.  As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The Deputy will recall that the CIWG has produced two reports since its inception and has been working to implement the 33 recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report published in 2017, as well as the 15 Recommendations of the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report, published in 2018.  To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:  </p>  <p>  - the passing of the Judicial Council Bill by the Oireachtas on 9 July in order to implement the  recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission regarding award levels in this country, including a judicial recalibration of the existing Book of Quantum guidelines;</p>  <p>  - the commencement by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.  </p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I have worked closely with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD to progress the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas as a matter of priority.  I am therefore pleased that the Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 July, and I expect it will be signed into law by the President shortly.  </p>  <p>  Now that the Bill has been passed, it will be a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to establish the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly and will take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the remaining recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and I expect to publish the Ninth Update Report by the Cost of Insurance Working Group in the coming weeks.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

Following this, the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 was published on 17 June, and it outlines an ambitious course of action, setting out how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also to put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  The Plan represents a significant step-up in ambition, and with a strong focus on implementation the Plan contains over 180 actions, assigning clear timelines and steps to support delivery. The Department of Finance has been assigned lead responsibility for a number of actions, primarily in the area of environmental taxation reform, with a number of measures to be examined as part of Budget 2020. </p>  <p>   In preparation of the Plan, officials from my Department have participated in the various cross-Government teams established to undertake analysis of areas of substantial mitigation and adaptation potential, and which have supported the development of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  Additionally, during the Plan&rsquo;s development, progress was considered at two meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure at which I attended, and at three meetings of the relevant Senior Officials Group which were attended by Department of Finance officials. Furthermore, updates on the Plan&rsquo;s progression have been routinely discussed at the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board and Senior Management Group meetings. As Minister for Finance, I am kept up to date on progress in relation to development of  climate initiatives. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.547.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100066#WRK00600"><p>At the outset it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s  (CIWG) and was the subject of a particular recommendation.  In this regard, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to returning emigrants, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies. </p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.  My Department continues to review the implementation of this recommendation through its regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I understand that in general, insurance companies set a date by which a no-claims bonus will expire, where the driver has held no insurance in their own name for two or more years.  This applies whether the person continues to reside in Ireland, or they decide to move abroad and it is primarily a commercial matter for insurance companies.  Therefore, if the person is abroad for less than two years, then it should not be necessary to continue to pay for a policy while abroad.  However, the protocol states that if more than two years have passed since the Irish motor insurance policy was cancelled/lapsed, the Irish No Claims Discount is no longer valid.  Notwithstanding this, if the person has been abroad for longer than two years, Insurance Ireland members have agreed through the protocol that if the person has claims-free driving experience in a different country in their own name, they will take this experience into consideration if that person seeks a quotation from an insurer, on their return to Ireland, subject to the appropriate verifiable documentation being provided.  If the Deputy is aware of instances where it appears that a person is having problems in this regard, I would suggest that the person contacts Insurance Ireland, who operate a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that the overall implementation of the CIWG&rsquo;s recommendations is having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance.  The latest CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak, consequently the average consumer should be seeing reductions when renewing their motor insurance.  In addition, I would note that representations made to my Department from returning emigrants have dropped significantly in the last year.  I am hopeful that this reflects that more are receiving insurance cover in line with the protocol referenced above.  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p></reply>

It subsequently provided a final report to the CIWG in January 2019.  In this report, the CSO outlined the method that they would recommend for the compilation of a price index for public and employer liability insurance.  I understand that this method is currently being piloted by the CSO and that good progress has been made.  In this context, the CSO is working closely with a technology partner and has had positive engagement to date from most of the relevant insurance companies.  I understand from the CSO that the pilot project will conclude at the end of September. </p>  <p>  In that context, I would expect that it will make a report to the CIWG in relation to its recommendation on a path forward.  It should be noted however that the CSO is an independent Office and it will ultimately be for them to determine whether or not to proceed with such an index.</p></reply>

The objective of the proposal is to ensure that policyholders are informed as soon as possible after a claim against their policy is lodged and informed after a claim is settled. In addition, the proposal will seek to require insurers to engage with the policyholder to ensure that the policyholder&rsquo;s views can be taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  This proposal originates from Recommendation 8 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance. A corresponding recommendation was then included in the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance (Rec 10) as this issue is generally far more pertinent to businesses and other liability insurance policyholders rather than individual motorists. Thus, the proposal seeks to include within the scope of the changes small businesses which have an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less.</p>  <p>  The Department engaged with Insurance Ireland to seek voluntary agreement of this proposal through a protocol. Unfortunately, no such agreement could be reached on a non-legislative basis.</p>  <p>As a result, it is proposed to include this legislative proposal within the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill which is based on a 2015 Law Reform Commission Report.  The Government provided support in principle for the objectives of this Bill at Second Stage and noted the intention of the Minister for Finance to submit substantive amendments should the Bill reach Committee Stage. This proposal has been developed as a Committee Stage amendment, which Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy will propose at the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach consideration of this Bill  on the 11th July.</p>  <p>  The reason the legislative changes are not being drafted as a new separate Bill is because I see the Consumer Insurance Contract Bill as an ideal vehicle for addressing insurance consumer related issues, such as this one, from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective.  In addition, as all parties have worked very constructively together on important insurance legislation such as the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018, and the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 to date, I see no reason why this constructive engagement cannot continue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.569.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100066#WRK02900"><p>Firstly I should clarify that public service lump sums payments were not directly reduced by the Financial Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. The FEMPI legislation introduced measures that directly reduced pay, and reduced annual pensions of public servants, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre- 2013 public service pension schemes are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. </p><p>However because of what is known as the first grace period, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). However the second grace period meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or lump sum.</p><p>Thus it is only those who retired from 1 March 2012 onwards whose lump sums are potentially, indirectly impacted by FEMPI, and it is only the first FEMPI reduction which could have had an impact. However salaries of all serving staff have been increased, and some restored to pre-FEMPI rates, through pay increase measures contained in FEMPI Act 2015 and The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the first of these measures being applied from 1 January 2016. Thus the lump sums of those retiring since such pay increases were introduced are not affected to the same extent, or if the salary has been fully restored by the time they retired their lump sum is not affected at all. (As of June 2019, pay reductions have been fully reversed for all public servants earning up to &euro;30,000 and this includes approximately 9,500 civil servants).</p><p>Due to the fact that there was no explicit measure to reduce lump sum payments contained in the FEMPI legislation, but rather an indirect impact, and to varying degrees, on certain lump sums, the information requested is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work. </p><p>However the following table illustrates an example of the impact on the lump sums of individuals who retired between 1 March 2012 (the date after the expiration of the first grace period) and before the date of the first pay increase, at different salary rates. It illustrates the difference between the lump sum that would have been received had the FEMPI reduction of 1 January 2010 not been reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their lump sum, and the lump sum received when this reduction is reflected in the salary rate used in the calculation.</p><p><table><tr><th>Salary rate pre FEMPI pay reduction of 1 Jan 2010</th><th>Salary rate with FEMPI reduction of 1 Jan 2010 applied</th><th>Lump sum payment based on 40 years' service if pre-FEMPI rate used to calculate lump sum</th><th>Lump sum payment based on 40 years' service if reduced rate used to calculate lump sum</th><th>% difference</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;28,500</td><td>&euro;45,000</td><td>&euro;42,750</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000</td><td>&euro;65,500</td><td>&euro;105,000</td><td>&euro;98,250</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000</td><td>&euro;92,500</td><td>&euro;150,000</td><td>&euro;138,750</td><td>8%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  Their contract terms continue to apply and they cease working when they reach the age of 66, as previously provided for.  </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the www.gov.ie website and in the Oireachtas Library online catalogue.  </p>  <p>  Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision, pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I decided not to make any changes to those terms.</p></reply>

In November 2018, my Department published a consultation paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions in the Public Spending Code, along with a review of the other central technical appraisal parameters used in the Code. </p>  <p>  The paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions concluded that the model currently in use for pricing carbon in the Public Spending Code is outdated. It proposed a new methodology that values future greenhouse gas emissions according to a shadow price of carbon that is based on the estimated marginal cost that will be faced by society in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target. </p>  <p>  In practical terms, this means a new shadow price of carbon for non-ETS emissions of &euro;32 per tonne in 2020, rising by &euro;6.80 a year to reach &euro;100 per tonne by 2030. Beyond 2030, it is proposed that the shadow price of carbon will continue to rise by 5% a year. This means that the shadow price of carbon rises to &euro;128 for 2035, &euro;163 for 2040, &euro;208 for 2045 and &euro;265 for 2050.  </p>  <p>  The consultation period has now concluded and my Department has completed its evaluation of the responses received. It is my intention to publish a decision paper detailing my Department's response to the views received along with a circular revising the Public Spending Code to take account of the revised shadow price of carbon during the course of July. The circular will also update other technical parameters, including a downward revision of the test discount rate from 5% to 4%. </p>  <p>  Collectively, these reforms will ensure that the Public Spending Code incorporates a more realistic appreciation of the climate consequences of all Government investment decisions.

The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.  </p><p>The following reforms will be considered and implemented as part of the Public Spending Code review:</p><p>- Strengthen and harmonise capital appraisal guidance;</p><p>- Greater clarity on governance and roles and responsibilities, particular in terms of who is the Sanctioning Authority and who is the Sponsoring Agency for major projects; </p><p>- Introduce new mechanisms to improve the accuracy of cost estimates;</p><p>- Improve project life cycle to better reflect the realities of project delivery; and</p><p>- Complement the Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker in monitoring projects and costs.</p><p>The revised central elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the appraisal and management of public capital projects will be published this summer.  Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in the second half of 2019 and in 2020.</p><p>Procurement legislation is established on an EU wide basis through the suite of procurement directives. The most recent directives were issued in 2014 and have all been transposed into Irish law by means of Statutory Instrument.</p><p>The Capital Works Management Framework (&quot;CWMF&quot;) is the structure that has been developed to deliver the Government&rsquo;s objectives in relation to public sector construction procurement reform. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents that must be used on all projects that are to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan (&quot;NDP&quot;).  It is managed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in consultation with the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  </p><p>The performance of a key component of the CWMF; the public works contract, was reviewed in 2014 and a series of recommendations that apply to the conditions of contract have been implemented since 2016.</p><p>That review prompted the OGP to undertake a broader review of the procurement of public works projects in order to develop the next generation of the CWMF.  </p><p>A set of objectives have been developed to manage the review process which will permit a progressive refinement of the CWMF rather than awaiting the completion of the entire work programme prior to implementation.  Enhanced risk management throughout a project&rsquo;s lifecycle and quality of information will inform all aspects of the work programme.  </p><p>Consultation has already commenced with industry and the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues that are impacting on the successful and timely delivery of projects.  These are wide ranging and warrant careful consideration and cover areas such as: </p><p>- price variation;</p><p>- risk management;</p><p>- creating a better quality : price balance in the award of contracts;</p><p>- adoption of BIM on public works projects;</p><p>- liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p><p>- performance evaluation;</p><p>- encouraging collaborative working.</p><p>It is proposed to publish a range of position papers throughout 2019 and 2020 on these and other issues and invite submissions from interested parties.  Upon conclusion of the consultation process recommendations will be prepared by the GCCC on the measures necessary to address any shortcomings identified.  </p><p>The programme commenced with a focus on the early stages of a project&rsquo;s development with the publication of a position paper on the engagement of the consultant technical professionals upon which submissions have been received.  The paper focusses on improving the manner in which consultants are engaged to provide expert advice to contracting authorities on matters such as design, cost estimating, project management, procurement and contract administration.</p></reply>

The Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings as published in each Expenditure Report from Budget 2014 to Budget 2019  are available at the following link:</p><p>This spreadsheet also sets out the outturn for each Department for 2014 to 2018. </p><p>The expenditure ceilings are presented here as they were published in each Expenditure Report from 2014 to 2019. As such, they do not reflect any transfers of functions or technical adjustments which have occurred within the period. As a result, ceilings may not be directly comparable for all Vote groups across the period.  The transfers of functions that have taken place between 2014 and 2019 are set out at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>A number of technical adjustments also impact on analysis of the 2014 to 2019 period. Significant among these are changes made in 2017 to funding for Irish Water. Following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, all Motor Tax receipts are paid into the Exchequer, rather than the Local Government Fund, and all State funding for domestic water services is provided through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This resulted in an increase in gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government of &euro;792 million.  This increase had no impact on overall General Government expenditure. </p><p>On the Defence Vote, from 2015 onwards, the purchase of military equipment was reclassified as capital expenditure rather than current expenditure. This accounts for the apparent rise in Defence capital expenditure that occurs between Budget 2015 and Budget 2016. Conversely, REV 2015 reflected the disestablishment of the HSE Vote with expenditure of the HSE now met by way of a grant from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence, certain income previously recognised as appropriations-in-aid on the HSE Vote is now retained by the HSE and is no longer reflected in gross expenditure ceilings or outturns from 2015 on. </p></reply>

These expenditure figures are available on . </p><p>In a number of years, there are technical changes which impact on the year-on-year increases. </p><p>This includes the disestablishment of the HSE Vote in 2014, with expenditure of the HSE now met by way of a grant from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence, certain income previously recognised as appropriations-in-aid on the HSE Vote is now retained by the HSE and is no longer reflected in gross expenditure ceilings or outturns from 2015 on. </p><p>Another significant alteration includes changes to the arrangements for funding of domestic water services in 2017. This impacted on the year-on-year increase from 2017 to 2018. Following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, all Motor Tax receipts are paid into the Exchequer, rather than the Local Government Fund, and all State funding for domestic water services is provided through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This resulted in an increase in gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government of &euro;792 million.  This increase had no impact on overall General Government expenditure. </p><p>Also included in the spreadsheet is the percentage movement in both GDP and GNP (based on current market prices) from 2000 to 2019. For 2000 &ndash; 2018, this data is sourced from CSO.ie.  The General Government Balance as a percentage of GDP figures presented here are also from the CSO. For 2019, the Department of Finance projections are provided, as published in the 2019 Stability Programme Update.  </p></reply>

Such an estimate would require analysis of the availability and willingness of schools to provide for this and also the availability of suitably qualified tutors to be available for home based July provision.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which advises the Minister on these matters published its Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism in July 2016 which included a review of the July Scheme.</p><p>The review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides day-time respite for families and a structured day for students. The NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.  </p><p>It is expected that the Group will make recommendations shortly concerning a revised scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.  Before any changes are made, there will be consultations with stakeholders.</p><p>I met with a number of representatives from Down Syndrome Ireland on 3rd July 2019. There was a very fruitful discussion across a range of issues affecting children with Down Syndrome in the education system, including the review of the July Provision Scheme. The Department undertook to continue to engage with Down Syndrome Ireland on a range of education matters.</p><p>The policy of my Department is to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children with Down syndrome, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

The hourly rate of pay for Bus Escorts will vary from time to time in line with revised salary rates arising from the various Public Service Stability Agreements[1].  School management authorities are notified of any revised salary rates as they occur by way of circular issued by my Department.  The current hourly rate of pay is &euro;12.85.&rdquo;</p></reply>

To meet this demographic challenge, during the course of 2019 over 80 large scale projects and 140 projects under the Additional Accommodation Scheme will be under construction.  Details on those projects and on all other school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process towards tender and construction are  available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.  The Department is also increasing its investment in higher education infrastructure; many of these projects are currently in the planning phase.   </p>  <p>  The success of the schools building programme is predicated on the need to ensure that at any given time, there are sufficient number of school projects available to proceed to construction. If this is not the case, then there is the risk that capital monies made available for the purpose of accommodating children at primary and post-primary level, cannot be spent and that the State cannot provide for school buildings at maximum capacity.  This ensures that when some projects experience delays such as site issues, planning difficulties, design challenges, etc., other projects can be progressed. </p>  <p>  The Department seeks to progress all approved education building projects to completion as soon as possible and works towards this objective in all cases.</p></reply>

The specific amount to be spent by the Department on each project in 2019 will depend on progress during the year and availability of funds.  Project cost estimates and project delivery timelines are kept under review through the design and planning process and financial allocations are not definitively assigned to individual projects until the point of entering into a contractual commitment for that particular project.

The Act also provides for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy. </p><p>The creation of the fund was announced in Budget 2000 by the then Minister for Finance to raise the skills of those in employment, to give jobseekers relevant skills and to facilitate lifelong learning.  The NTF replaced the Apprenticeship Levy which was set up under The Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Act 1994. In May 2010, responsibility for the NTF was transferred from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>During the recession, the focus moved sharply from training those in employment to supporting unemployed people back into the workplace. However there has been a fundamental shift in the labour market over the last 6 years with unemployment falling from a 16% high in 2012 to 5.6% in February 2019. This has been reflected in a changed and rebalanced suite of NTF-funded programmes to support the larger working population, to address the higher demand for lifelong learning as the influence of technology increases and to seek to address emerging areas of skills and labour shortage. </p><p>The NTF enables more flexible responses to changing economic/labour market conditions. As the economic climate has improved, expenditure on training for those in employment has increased with a corresponding reduction in expenditure on training for those seeking employment. This trend is evident from 2014 to 2018 and will continue in 2019.</p><p>Following a consultation process, the Government, as part of Budget 2018, decided to raise the rate of the National Training Fund (NTF) levy by 0.1% in 2018 to 0.8%. As part of Budget 2019, the levy was raised by a further 0.1% to 0.9% and by 0.1% in 2020 on the basis of the implementation of planned reforms.</p><p>An independent review of the National Training Fund was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills as part of the package of reforms. This independent review, which was undertaken by Indecon, was published by the Minister for Education and Skills on 17 August 2018.  The report made 14 specific recommendations across 4 key areas:</p><p>- Reform of the future direction of the NTF.</p><p>- Utilising the NTF to support investment in Higher Education.</p><p>- Enhancing enterprise engagement and input to NTF priorities.</p><p>- Improvements in monitoring/evaluation of the NTF.</p><p>An Implementation Plan to deliver the recommendations contained in the Independent Review was published as part of Budget 2019 along with details of a new advisory group to the National Skills Council in order optimise enterprise engagement on NTF priorities. </p><p>I attach a file showing the amount collected from the NTF levy and the expenditure as requested and the number of participants funded by the National Training Fund from 2010 to 2018, which is the information available.  </p><p>Additional information is available in the recently published expenditure report available at the following link:</p></reply>

At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and at post-primary level to the Post Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS ceased making payments to IoTs and apprentices pay the full pro rata ASC.</p>  <p>  The amount charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in IoTs during the academic year. For craft apprenticeships, this cost would typically be one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT.  In the case of the new consortia led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as their off-the-job training has a more flexible structure.   In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution made by the apprentice. </p>  <p>  Based on projected apprenticeship provision in higher education institutions, apprentices or their employers will make up to &euro;6.6 million in ASCs in 2019.

In addition, the Government has already committed to a five year programme of increased investment amounting to &euro;300m, commencing next year, under the Human Capital Initiative. It represents a significant response to projected demographic pressures impacting on the sector over the next five years, as highlighted in the report on future funding. </p></reply>

Since then, the NCCA has embarked on a review of the primary curriculum with language and mathematics being the first areas to be redeveloped using a learning outcomes approach. </p><p>It is generally agreed that Learning Outcomes are broad statements of what a learner knows, understands and is able to do after completion of learning. In the case of the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum, the learning outcomes also set out big mathematical ideas for children&rsquo;s learning. The outcomes represent a shift towards thinking about what children will learn rather than what is to be taught.</p><p>Learning Outcomes in the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum will help teachersto: </p><p>- select what to teach and the best order in which to teach it</p><p>- choose the most appropriate teaching methods and learning tasks and experiences for the children in their specific classrooms </p><p>- improve assessment by linking methods to the intended Learning Outcomes thereby ensuring more authentic assessment </p><p>- provide more focused and helpful feedback to children.  </p><p>Sharing Learning Outcomes with childrenwill help them to:</p><p>- be clear about what they are meant to be learning in maths</p><p>- monitor their own progress </p><p>- be able to take greater control of their own mathematical learning. </p><p>Based on international research as described in NCCA&rsquo;s Research Reports 17 and 18, the overarching aim of the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum, to which the learning outcomes contribute, is the development of all children&rsquo;s mathematical proficiency. This proficiency encompasses conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, adaptive reasoning, strategic competence, and productive disposition. Mathematical proficiency has been adopted as a key aim in policy documents on mathematics in many countries, for example, the US (CCSSM/NGA, 2010), New Zealand (Anthony &amp;amp; Walshaw, 2007) and Australia (ACARA, 2009). </p><p>The NCCA will publish the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum for junior infants to sixth class in 2020 for consultation. </p></reply>

Circulars may be addressed to a variety of stakeholders including, for example, teachers, principals,  school managers and Education and Training Boards. </p>  <p>  Engagement with stakeholders on circulars can happen in a variety of ways. For instance, there are industrial relations fora set up across the education sector where issues arising from circulars may be raised. Education and Training Boards are required to comply with the Department's circulars. They are subject to audit by the Internal Audit Unit - ETBs to ensure, inter alia, compliance with the relevant circulars.</p>  <p>  In the instance where a school inspector, in the course of an inspection, becomes aware of a school&rsquo;s non-compliance with Departmental circulars, the inspector will bring the matter to the attention of principal and to the Board of Management as appropriate. The non-compliance may also feature in findings and recommendations section of the inspection report. Where serious and/or multiple instances of non-compliance are noted the Inspectorate forwards a memo on the non-compliance to the relevant section of the Department for their attention. </p>  <p>  Non-compliance with the requirements of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 (circular 81/2017) are always referred to in a discrete section of the inspection report.</p></reply>

In particular, I am very conscious that the school will have to continue to operate from unsatisfactory conditions with increasing enrolments until its new building is ready. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also recall that a programme provided by the contractor which had indicated a completion date in July has recently been changed to provide for a completion date in October. Let me reiterate my extreme disappointment and frustrated with this development. </p>  <p>  The contractor is responsbile for resourcing and programming the construction works in question. WCC, which is responsible for managing the contract, has expressed to the contractor directly its disappointment with the level of resources on site and the slow progress of the construction programme. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Westmeath County Council has reported to my officials that there has been a significant improvement in the activity on site in recent weeks. The project is well over 80% complete and, on that basis, I am hopeful that the project will be completed in October as is now planned. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure optimum use is made of the resources.</p><p>In 2017 the Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies.</p><p>The Divisional Garda Traffic Corps have been re-named Garda Road Policing Units, to reflect the role the Units will play in denying criminals the use of the roads network. In addition to the Roads Policing Units focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, they will also focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Divisional Roads Policing Units will work closely with other Divisional units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.</p><p>The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfer applications, including welfare issues. When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>The strength of the Roads Policing Units by Division, in each of the years 2009 to 31 May 2019 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link:</p><p>The overall workforce strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link:</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

This equates to just over seven reports per month, with 1 November 2018 being the date on which a new category for &quot;insurance fraud&quot; went live on PULSE. 50% of these incidents related to staged collisions.</p><p>It is important to note that the aforementioned figures refer to reports being made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the respective timeframe. Many of the alleged incidents reported during that period are historical in nature and occurred outside of the reporting timeframe. </p><p>It is also important to note that, while all incidents come under the umbrella of the &quot;insurance fraud&quot; category, not all of them relate to bogus insurance claims. For example, incidents of forged 'no claims bonus' documents, while being an insurance fraud, does not necessarily relate to a bogus insurance claim<i>. </i>Alternatively, a report of a staged collision clearly does link to a bogus insurance claim. Such nuances should be kept in mind when analysing this data.</p><p>Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have stressed that the data is correct as at 6 June 2019, however as it is operational data it is, therefore, subject to change.</p></reply>

A Family Court Bill will be introduced to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures. These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements.  </p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the family court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, a task force on the Family Court comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  A representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also joined the group. The work of this group is at an advanced stage. Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Work is well advanced on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill. When finalised, the General Scheme will be submitted for Government approval in the usual manner and will have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill is only one component of a new Family Court system. The provision of appropriate court facilities and services, including the designation of areas for support services, and the capital and current resources that may be required for this, will be important enablers for the operation of a new family court system. </p></reply>

They were prepared by a Standards Advisory Group, established in 2017 and comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion as well as representatives from AkiDwA, Children's Rights Alliance, the Core Group of Asylum Seekers and Refugees, the Jesuit Refugee Service, SPIRASI,  and the UNHCR. The Standards address a range of themes including accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State, food and catering, individual, community and family life, health and wellbeing, governance and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  They therefore build on the work done in the 2015 McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the Recast Reception Directive.</p>  <p>  The standards were opened to public consultation last year which included dedicated information workshops at a number of accommodation centres.   </p>  <p>  It is planned to publish the standards shortly. The current procurement process in respect of direct provision accommodation was designed with a view to ensuring that all direct provision accommodation will adhere to these standards, when they come into force in January 2021.</p>  <p>  I am committed to developing a robust independent inspection process to monitor and ensure compliance with the standards following their implementation. </p></reply>

Successful bidders were required to undertake mobilisation works to provide for residents cooking facilities,  a foodhall (where residents can obtain ingredients and food items as well as toiletries and household items through a points system) and designated living space for families outside of the bedrooms.  There is a 12 week provision for the completion of the required mobilisation works. No contract will be in effect until the mobilisation works are completed and subsequently inspected and verified as complete by RIA.</p>  <p>  The provider who is currently providing accommodation and ancillary services at the Towers Centre in Clondalkin, Dublin 22 was successful in being placed on the framework. The 12 week mobilisation period commenced on the 11th April 2019 which required all works to be complete by the 4th July 2019.  My Department has been informed recently that due to logistical reasons, the contractor was unable to commence mobilisation works. Following discussions, the contractor has agreed to commence these works and the current contract has been extended to allow this to happen. </p></reply>

This is usually in the form of a currently valid passport and may include other original supporting documents, such as a previously held or out of date passport, birth certificate or register of birth and marriage certificate.</p>  <p>  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot produce their current passport, or a previous passport, birth certificate or other supporting documents the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation. Such explanation should, where possible, be supported by satisfactory evidence that they have attempted to obtain such documentation and correspondence from the relevant authorities or embassy responsible for the issuing of passports and birth certificates in their country, clearly stating the reasons the documentation cannot be provided. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) will consider the explanation given and, if satisfied it is for reasons genuinely beyond the applicant's control, may suggest alternative means to the person to assist in establishing their identity and nationality. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship is governed by specific legal provisions and an assessment as to whether an application is eligible or not can only be made after an application has been submitted. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.896.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100070#WRO07100"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the manner in which the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are deployed is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no direct role in this regard.</p>  <p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  In common with all Government Departments and State Agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been preparing for Brexit and there is ongoing engagement between senior Garda management and my Department in this regard.  Preparation has had a wide-ranging focus on operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure and technology. I know the Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation can deal with any policing challenges arising from Brexit though clearly the circumstances which may arise are dependant on the political settlement.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, the Government's policy is that there will be no hard border on the island and there are no plans for such.  However, as he is also aware, policing in the border region has always presented particular challenges and this can be expected to increase in the context of Brexit.  It is also the case that violent dissident republican groups continue to seek to frustrate counter-terrorism efforts and organised criminals seek to exploit the two jurisdictions in order to try to evade detection.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Cross-Border Threat Assessment prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI estimated that some 43 per cent of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-border dimension. Likewise, mobile organised crime groups, responsible for multiple instances of domestic burglary, operate on an all-island basis.  There are increasing instances of borderless crimes such as cyber fraud and international terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The success of cross border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combatting the threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance the excellent levels of cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement recognised this and led to the establishment of Joint Agency Investigation Teams which have had considerable success in combatting this type of crime.   I understand this is also the context for the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit in Cavan.  </p>  <p>  Garda ASUs provide a rapid armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis. Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions. In the Northern Region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth.  An additional ASU for the Northern Region is to be established in Cavan.</p>  <p>  Garda deployments in all areas of the country including those along the Border have benefitted from increased recruitment in recent years.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as on 31 May, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,448 Garda&iacute;. There are 56 Garda Reserves and 153 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.   An additional 50 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region from the last attestation on 7 June 2019.  </p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have also provided the capacity to expand the specialist bureaus including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region in addition to the Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance by the Cost of Insurance Working Group recognised the data challenges in establishing the number of initial complaints and investigations through to the resultant cases of prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area and the Report made recommendations to address this matter. </p>  <p>  While the Courts Service was consulted in respect of recommendation 12 to commence producing statistics on prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area, it was considered that the addition of a specific Insurance Fraud category on the PULSE system would allow for the production of such statistics and consequently it was agreed that these statistics would be provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rather that the Courts Service as originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that while technical issues arose with the introduction of a new "insurance fraud" category on the PULSE system, these issues have now been resolved and the collection of statistics under the new category has commenced. </p>  <p>  The most recent figures provided to me by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na show that, in the period 1 November 2018 to end May 2019, 50 incidents of insurance fraud were recorded on PULSE. This equates to just over seven reports per month, with 1 November 2018 being the date on which a new category for "insurance fraud" went live on PULSE. 50% of these incidents related to staged collisions.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the aforementioned figures refer to reports being made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the respective timeframe. Many of the alleged incidents reported during that period are historical in nature and occurred outside of the reporting timeframe.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that, while all incidents come under the umbrella of the "insurance fraud" category, not all of them relate to fraudulent insurance claims. For example, incidents of forged 'no claims bonus' documents, while being an insurance fraud, does not necessarily relate to an insurance claim.  </p>  <p>  Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have stressed that the data is correct as at 6 June 2019.  However as it is operational data it is, therefore, subject to change. </p></reply>

The remit of the GNECB includes playing a pro-active role in the prevention and detection of fraud, and acting as a central repository for fraud related intelligence and therefore the GNECB effectively houses the Garda fraud unit.</p>  <p>  In relation specifically to insurance fraud investigation, which has been discussed on a number of recent occasions in this House, I have previously outlined how the Garda Commissioner is of the view that a divisional focus on insurance fraud is preferable to the establishment of a centralised insurance fraud investigation unit. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware of Deputy Commissioner John Twomey's appearance in front of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 9th July. At the Committee, the Deputy Commissioner clearly set out the organisation's plans for fraud investigation:</p>  <p>  "At meetings between Commissioner Harris and Minister D&rsquo;Arcy, both parties were agreed that private funding of a specialist insurance fraud unit was not the preferred option...</p>  <p>  Commissioner Harris has also informed the Minister that in line with the overall Garda strategy, GNECB will focus on major organised frauds including insurance cases and individual insurance frauds will be dealt with at divisional level. This is in line with the greater emphasis on divisional-led policing as outlined in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. This divisional-led approach is currently being trialled as part of our four Divisional Policing Model pilots."</p>  <p>  Deputy Commissioner Twomey went on to state:</p>  <p>  "The Commissioner believes that it is important that there is sufficient expertise at divisional level to deal with individual frauds. Each division already has a number of Garda&iacute; trained in fraud investigation and 50 more will be trained this year. The resource requirement for each Division will be different and will depend on the number of crimes reported and requiring investigation. Further  resources &ndash; 6 Sergeants and 6 Garda&iacute; - have also recently been provided to GNECB to assist in all areas of fraud investigation. It is anticipated that a competition for positions in GNECB will commence in the second half of this year. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop in-house expertise in investigating insurance-related fraud. All Detective Garda&iacute; and Detective Sergeants receive fraud training. In addition, since 2016, 132 Garda&iacute; have been trained in the investigation of fraud and e-crime investigation at University College Dublin."</p>  <p>  I trust this information provides a clear picture of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's plans to tackle insurance fraud across the State.</p></reply>

The programme outlines the steps SPSV operators can take to make life safer, more secure and compliant with current health and safety legislation, and there is a specific section on looking after their personal security.</p>  <p>  Separately, I am informed that all taxi drivers, as part of their initial training and preparation for examinations, are provided with the Official Manual for Operating within the SPSV Industry. This manual is produced by the NTA in consultation with the Garda Crime Prevention Unit and contains a chapter entitled Staying Safe. The chapter offers a range of information and suggestions on how to deal with difficult customers or dangerous situations. This includes suggestions on taking extra care in isolated areas, making eye contact with the customer when the customer gets into the car, and arranging a code word with the dispatch operator or a colleague that can be used in communication with them if danger is perceived.</p>  <p>  Information regarding ways to reduce the risk of robbery is also provided. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recommended that taxi drivers:</p>  <p>  - avoid carrying large sums of cash where possible;</p>  <p>  - not show, or tell, customers how much cash they have and be discrete with their cash when giving a customer change;</p>  <p>  - not display valuables; and,</p>  <p>  - lock their vehicles while in isolated areas or waiting for a customer to arrive.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also advises that taxi drivers who have been the victims of robbery or fare evasion should not chase the perpetrators because this might put their </p>  <p>  personal safety at further risk. In addition, it is advised that taxi drivers should not take any action that might be deemed to be illegal or, again, put themselves at risk, such as detaining a passenger by force.

The Superior Courts have an inherent supervisory role over solicitors including, particularly, the High Court, which can impose sanctions for professional misconduct up to and including the striking off of any solicitor concerned. This is to ensure that solicitors comply with their ethical obligations and act with the highest standards of conduct while also allowing the court to discipline or penalise solicitors who have failed in their duty to the court. The court therefore relies on solicitors to comply with their duties and to take careful instructions from their clients, to prepare their pleadings carefully, and to represent their client as best they can while complying with their duties to the court of candour and disclosure. </p>  <p>  Similarly, barristers have a duty to the court. Under the Professional Code of the Honorable Society of the King's Inns it is the duty of barristers to act at all times with honesty and integrity and not to engage in conduct which is prejudicial to the administration of justice. They are also obliged to comply with the provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and any relevant code issued by the Regulatory Authority.  Specifically, barristers have an over-riding duty to the court to ensure, in the public interest, that the proper and efficient administration of justice is achieved and they must assist the court in the administration of justice and must not deceive or knowingly mislead the court.  The Code of Conduct of the Bar of Ireland also provides that a barrister shall not knowingly make, procure or countenance the making of any false or misleading statement of fact, whether express or implied, written or parol, with regard to any matter in which the barrister is engaged to any court or other body. </p>  <p>  It should be noted, therefore, that the courts supervision of these matters is in addition to those broader measures that also apply to solicitors and barristers in the conduct of their business under their respective professional regulatory regimes. These are matters which will fall, to a growing extent, to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will come into substantial operational mode in this area from October 2019. This will happen under Part 6 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which I will be commencing at that time. The Authority will then deal with disciplinary and conduct matters in relation to both solicitors and barristers.  This will be bolstered by the separate establishment of the new Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal which will address serious misconduct in relation to both solicitors and barristers - including in terms of their possible striking off or disbarment with the approval of the High Court.</p>  <p>  As I have set out , there are serious consequences for any legal practitioner who may be found to have acted in contravention of those duties owed to the court, including as the Deputy has raised, where this may involve an element of fraud. I would also point out that this is without prejudice to any investigation of such fraudulent matters by the competent authorities under the criminal law.</p></reply>

On 6 February 2018, in response to parliamentary question 65, I advised the Deputy that my Department had established a Working Group to progress the action points raised under recommendation 25 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, i.e. the establishment of a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry.</p><p>This Working Group continues to meet in order to establish an appropriate mechanism whereby insurance companies can share information to assist in the combatting of fraud. However, data protection-related issues have dominated the group&rsquo;s deliberations and ultimately have made it impossible to establish the database by the end of 2018, as had been scheduled.</p><p>The Working Group has engaged in discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC), the respective UK bodies dealing with insurance fraud (the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department and the Insurance Fraud Bureau), and completed a report which includes the recommended agreed parameters of the database, who is to be responsible, how it will be funded, and who will have access.</p><p>As noted last year, the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the related Data Protection Bill will have a significant impact on any new data sharing arrangements between industry members and between the industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As such, the establishment of any new data sharing structures will require careful consideration against the changes to the legislative landscape. More generally, a critical balance will also be sought to ensure that data sharing between insurers is maximised while, at the same time, the data rights of the public are protected. Any changes, therefore, must be proportional to their effect.</p><p>The report of the Working Group was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General and the ODPC and in response, the ODPC strongly endorsed the group&rsquo;s view that a detailed Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was required in order to answer outstanding concerns regarding the potential addition of new datasets to Insurance Ireland's existing InsuranceLink database, and the increased sharing of data. </p><p>The ODPC recommended that further work be completed to detail the evidential requirements for the creation of a new database or the enhancement of the existing InsuranceLink database. The benefits of such a database should be assessed against the potential harm or detriments that could occur to individuals and their fundamental rights. The Office of the Attorney General has also considered the Working Group&rsquo;s report and further consultation will take place following the conclusion of the outstanding data protection matters.</p><p>In October last year, Insurance Ireland completed a DPIA in relation to matters such as the information currently held on InsuranceLink, as well as the specific additional data it is proposed will be shared, plus the additional circumstances under which the data will be shared. </p><p>Since receiving the DPIA, my officials conducted preliminary consultations with the ODPC, followed by more detailed consultations with the Department's internal Data Protection Support and Compliance Office (DPSCO). Subsequently, it was agreed by the Working Group (which met most recently in June 2019) that my officials would submit Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s DPIA on InsuranceLink to the ODPC on behalf of Insurance Ireland. The DPIA was submitted to the ODPC, in accordance with Article 36 of the GDPR, on 14 June 2019 and a response is awaited.</p><p>Engagement will continue with the insurance industry to see if it is possible to develop an enhanced version of the existing industry database, with the management of the database to be with an independent, not-for-profit body. This approach will provide for complete and open access to the data held on the database for all existing and new entrant market participants.</p><p>Subject to consultation with the ODPC, the next phase towards implementation of recommendation 25 will require the identification of such an appropriate independent body to manage the database. These matters will continue to be monitored by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, who produce public-facing reports to track the progress of each recommendation on a routine basis: </p></reply>

A decision on his previous application issued by letter to his legal representative on 14 May 2018.</p>  <p>  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received, and every application is considered on its individual merits, regardless of whether the applicant had applied previously.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. The fact that a person may have had an application refused does not preclude or disqualify them from submitting a fresh application in the future. Indeed, the letter advising an applicant of a negative decision also informs them that they may re-apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time. The letter advises that, when considering making such a re-application, they should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter and that any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The package of Brexit supports encompasses finance, advisory and awareness.  DBEI&rsquo;s focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.</p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p>  <p>  ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,613 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,405 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit.</p>  <p>  In addition, 644 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 605 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 531 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, developed in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, provides relatively short term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme is available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,700 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions. EI is working closely with regionally-important larger companies in exposed sectors such as food to support strategic investments to build resilience &ndash; EI invested&euro;74 million in these businesses in 2018. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p>  <p>  In addition, eligible EI client companies can respond to the threats and opportunities posed by Brexit by accessing the Agile Innovation Fund.  This fund supports clients to quickly develop innovations and respond to opportunities and threats in new and existing markets. The new Fund allows companies to access up to 50% in support of innovation projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000. A recent EI survey showed that EI clients that have availed of Innovation Capability, Funding and Collaboration support saw a 67% increase in global sales.</p>  <p>  EI also launched a Customs Insights online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  The majority of the above schemes are open to all SMEs, not just agency clients. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In my meeting with Commissioner Vestager on 24th January 2019, we discussed the severe challenges that Irish businesses, especially SMEs, will face when the UK leaves the European Union and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  We agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner&rsquo;s team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2017, the Commission approved a Rescue and Restructuring Scheme for Ireland for Undertakings in Difficulty.  Under the scheme, an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention by the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term. </p>  <p>  While the nature of the UK's departure from the EU still remains to be determined, Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

The Irish standards and regulations were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. These standards are in line with those introduced in the UK, which is particularly relevant given the cross-border trade in furniture on the island of Ireland and the presence of furniture manufacturers along the border area.</p>  <p>  The UK has undertaken two consultations (in 2014 and 2016) on the suitability of the UK regulations but has yet to amend its regulations. In view of the similarity of the regulations in both jurisdictions, my Department has liaised very closely with the relevant department in the UK and continues to monitor the situation to keep abreast of developments in that jurisdiction. My Department also liaises, both formally and informally, with other stakeholders in Ireland on the issue.</p>  <p>  Having similar regulations in place on both sides of the border gives consumers clarity and certainty that uniform safety standards apply, while manufacturers have certainty that their products can be sold in both jurisdictions without going to the added expense of manufacturing furniture according to different standards and legislation. Any change in existing regulations, or replacement thereof, will have to provide a robust level of safety when it comes to furniture going on fire. </p>  <p>  My Department is conscious of the need to ensure that if replacement regulations are to be introduced, they must be effective and evidence-based, bearing in mind the tension between short term effects (in relation to flame retardant chemicals providing time to escape a fire and the impact on fire crews&rsquo; operations) and possible long-term health considerations. There is also a need to ensure that if the Regulations are to change there will be no reduction in safety for the consumers of Ireland.</p></reply>

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to raise awareness and, where appropriate, to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department's ongoing engagement with businesses indicates that the proportion of businesses preparing for Brexit is increasing, particularly among those businesses identified as most exposed to Brexit-related impacts, and that awareness of the key Brexit challenges is also increasing. Almost 60% of Irish SMEs report a good understanding of the likely implications of Brexit impacts that are relevant to their business. The findings of our latest research suggest that planning for Brexit is increasing with almost 50% of SMEs taking some form of active engagement (up from 42% in 2018) in the form of planning or any other  mitigating steps. Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan. Among Enterprise Ireland clients, 85% have taken action in respect of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years my Department has worked to raise awareness of the key Brexit challenges which include supply chain, tariffs, customs, regulatory standards, working capital and movement of labour, goods and services; to build business preparedness levels; and to put a comprehensive set of supports in place for businesses. My Department and I have been active in the promotion of schemes and supports through participation in different campaigns, including the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. In addition to these, Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country to better understand their exposure to Brexit and the mitigating actions available to them.</p>  <p>  While there is little clarity on the means by which the UK will leave the EU in October, my Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports to ensure that businesses across the country are prepared for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU, whatever the circumstances of its departure.  Evidence now shows a marked increase in the number of impacted businesses preparing for change, which is both encouraging and welcome but I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led some businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses and I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17th April and up to July 8 it received 524 eligibility applications and issued 482 eligibility letters.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p><p>Over 5,300 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 199 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 266 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,260 Customs Insights Course participants.</p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.  The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (28 June 2019 unless otherwise stated)</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>669 applications received, 608 approved by SBCI, 150 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;32.93 million.<br /><br />(Uptake as of 5 July)</td></tr><tr><td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td><td>524 applications received, 482 approved by SBCI, 17 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;2.96 million.<br /><br />(Uptake as of 8 July)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td>5,334 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 1095 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>199 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new   markets</td><td>171 companies have been approved under this initiative[1]</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td><td>3,833 Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td><td>1,269 Customs Insights Course participants</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td>55 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>266 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>1,073 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td>605 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant[2]</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>340 LEO clients have participated in the programme  </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>644 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td>4,655 Participants at the Brexit Information events  </td></tr><tr><td>Customs Training Participants</td><td>531 Participants attended Customs Training</td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td>3,219 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

Its foundation is the National Planning Framework (NPF) and it includes a detailed investment plan for the period 2018-2027. </p><p>Project Ireland 2040, in highlighting the employment challenge, has identified the likely need to create in excess of 660,000 additional jobs in the period up to 2040. Project Ireland 2040 contains 10 Strategic Outcomes, one of which is; <b>&lsquo;</b>A Strong Economy, supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills<b>&rsquo;</b>.  The Department together with its Enterprise agencies have a key role to play in delivering this Strategic Outcome. The National Development Plan sets out the configuration for public capital investment over the period 2018-2027 to drive the implementation of Project 2040 and the National Strategic Outcomes of the NPF. Insofar as the capital funding for DBEI is concerned, the Plan commits a total of &euro;3.16 billion for DBEI capital priority projects over the first five years of the plan out to 2022, i.e. an increase of over 28%.</p><p>The Capital funding provided to my Department is mainly in the way of grants to support the multi-annual programmes of our enterprise development and innovation agencies.</p><p>The NDP identified the following specific Business, Enterprise and Innovation Priority Investments under the &ldquo;Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills&rdquo; National Strategic Outcome, whose delivery is the prime responsibility of DBEI;</p><p>- Expansion of Advanced Manufacturing Supports, linking centres and capacity across all regions Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund</p><p>- Strengthened SFI Research Centres and EI Technology Centres in higher education in all regions</p><p>- Participation in EU High Performance Computing Programme</p><p>- Upgrading of the Tyndall National Institute in Cork</p><p>- New Space Technologies Programme, to the benefit of firms in the regions</p><p>- Membership of CERN</p><p>- New cycles of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, benefiting Higher Education in all regions</p><p>- New Regional Sectoral Clusters to scale and internationalise enterprise in all regions</p><p>- New regional &lsquo;Technology and Innovation Poles&rsquo;, led through the Institutes of Technologies</p><p>- Brexit Business Transformation through firm level supports</p><p>- Expanding Enterprise Ireland budget for research and development</p><p>- Expanding IDA Regional Property Programme, to attract investment to regions</p><p>- A National Design Centre</p><p>- Seed and Venture Capital Funding to support regional start-ups and growth</p><p>- eHubs for entrepreneurship and start-ups in every county</p><p>The additional &euro;65million in capital money provided to my Department through the 2019 Estimates has allowed it to progress a number of the DBEI priority projects further in 2019. Specifically,</p><p>- the &euro;20m funding provided to the Disruptive Technologies Fund ensured that the funding for projects approved under the first phase of the Fund could be drawn down in 2019</p><p>- the additional &euro;10m provided to the IDA has enabled it to continue and expand its programme of providing property solutions, strategic sites and grants to deliver FDI across the regions of the country</p><p>- the &euro;6m provided to the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which builds upon the &euro;17m provided to the Scheme in 2018, will assist business to access the finance necessary to enable them to strategically transform/adapt to the impact of Brexit</p><p>- the additional &euro;2.75million in capital funding provided to EI has enabled it to progress a number of regionally focussed initiatives with Institutes of Technology through a programme of Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters to support regions across the country to build enterprise capability</p><p>- the capital funding provided to EI will has also allowed it to roll out the new &euro;175million Seed and Venture Programme which will focus on fostering a strong pipeline of high growth innovative businesses by increasing the availability of risk capital for start-up/early stage enterprises</p><p>- the Department&rsquo;s increased capital funding will ensure that Ireland can continue to expand and deepen its membership of and collaborations with international research organisations such as the European Southern Observatory and the European Space Agency </p><p>- the additional capital funding also allowed the new programmes for Postgraduate Research at Masters and PhD levels to continue to be rolled out</p><p>- the additional funding being provided to SFI has enabled it to refresh its Research Centres Programme thereby strengthening collaboration with enterprises across all regions of the country</p><p>- the additional funding being provided to the Tyndall Institute has enabled it to continue to upgrade and expand and stay at the forefront of new technologies</p><p>The capital allocation for DBEI in the first five years of the NDP to 2022 will enable us to continue the positive start to delivering on the ambition of the NPF and NDP. It is recognised that the full implementation of the Priority Investment Projects under NSO 5 will also require the allocation of substantial capital funding over the period of the Plan and DBEI and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) will work together as part of the annual estimates processes to ensure that all the aforementioned Business, Enterprise and Innovation Priority Investment Projects are fully implemented within the lifetime of the Plan to secure the desired outcomes.</p></reply>

The Unit also leads on engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to inform and validate our response to Brexit. </p><p>When the Unit was set up in 2016 it consisted of three staff, one Principal Officer, one Assistant Principal Officer and one Higher Executive Officer. Additional staffing of two Assistant Principal Officers, one Higher Executive Officer and one Clerical Officer were appointed in 2017. The Department also appointed a further AO to the Unit in early 2019 but this position has recently become vacant.</p><p>Also within this Division, two officials (Assistant Principal Officer and Administrative Officer) working in the Trade Policy Unit are assigned to Brexit related trade matters as part of their portfolios.</p><p>In the Division with responsibility for Indigenous Enterprise, two posts were approved (Assistant Principal Officer and Administrative Officer) to work solely on Brexit mitigation measures to support business impacted by Brexit.</p><p>A team of three was approved to establish a new Getting Business Brexit Ready Unit. This unit was comprised of one Assistant Principal Officer, one Administrative Officer and one Executive Officer. All three appointments were made in January 2019. A decision was later made to subsume the AP role into our Communications team to promote awareness of DBEI Brexit supports to all businesses in Ireland. </p><p>Staff expertise is also being drawn from across a number of different policy areas of the Department in shaping our Brexit response and a number of areas that are most impacted have been assigned additional staff including but not exclusively to deal with Brexit. We are continually prioritising the Brexit challenges and will actively keep the staffing requirements under review through workforce planning.</p><p>I have set out in the table below the number of additional staff appointed to Brexit related positions in my Department and in the Agencies under its remit during 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019.</p><p>In relation to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is not possible to provide the numbers for all new hires and replacement staff over the three-year period in the time allotted.

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility.</p><p>My Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that to ensure that businesses around the country are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m. I also provided extra staff for the regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.</p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018. The LEOs are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs are there to support businesses in preparing for Brexit, to ensure that businesses are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. </p><p>In addition, 644 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 605 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 531 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit, I allocated &euro;3 million in additional resources to Enterprise Ireland [EI] in budget 2019. EI has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p><p>Over 5,300 business have used EI&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 199 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 266 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,260 Customs Insights Course participants.</p><p>I also allocated &euro;2.75m additional capital to EI to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit, I allocated &euro;2million in additional resources to IDA Ireland, while an extra &euro;10 million has been allocated for the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. IDA Ireland continues to work closely with international clients, from a range of sectors, to help them assess and prepare for the potential impacts of Brexit, and to capitalise on any opportunities for additional Brexit-related foreign direct investment (FDI) in the future. </p><p>The IDA offers support and advice on Brexit-related risks and opportunities and the Agency&rsquo;s Brexit Toolkit, which is available to clients, includes the full range of supports across training, research and development and capital investment.</p><p>The Agency is working hard to avail of new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets. The Agency&rsquo;s efforts in this context have already yielded positive results, with over 80 Brexit-related investments and 5,300 associated jobs won to date. In addition, the Agency has recently launched a marketing campaign in key international markets to communicate clearly to both current and potential investors that, Ireland&rsquo;s investment proposition remains strong and that Ireland remains an attractive location for investment.</p><p>Funding to InterTrade Ireland has been increased by 18%. InterTrade Ireland plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 3,200 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p><p>ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,613 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,405 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTrade Ireland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, has leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  </p><p>As at 5 July, there have been 669 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 608 have been approved to date by SBCI. 150 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;32.93 million.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme, launched in March, makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years. This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17th April and up to July 8 it received 524 eligibility applications and issued 482 eligibility letters.</p><p>The first table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 28 June 2019.</p><p>The second table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.  The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p><p><table><tr><th><b>Scheme</b></th><th><b>Uptake (28 June 2019)</b></th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td><b>669 </b>applications received, 608 approved by SBCI,<b> 150 </b>Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of <b>&euro;32.93 </b>million.<br /><br />(Uptake as of 5 July)</td></tr><tr><td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td><td><b>524 </b>applications received, 482 approved by SBCI,<b> 17 </b>Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of <b>&euro;2.96 </b>million.<br /><br />(Uptake as of 8 July)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td><b>5,334 </b>Brexit Scorecards have been completed.<b> 1095</b> LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td><b>199</b> Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new   markets</td><td><b>171</b> companies have been approved under this initiative</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td><td><b>3,833 </b>Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td><td><b>1,269 </b>Customs Insights Course participants</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td><b>55</b> Agile Innovation projects have been approved<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td><b>16</b> Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over <b>1,200</b> in attendance</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td><b>266 </b>&ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td><b>1,073</b> Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td><b>605</b> clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td><b>340</b> LEO clients have participated in the programme <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td><b>644</b> mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td><b>4,655</b> Participants at the Brexit Information events</td></tr><tr><td>Customs Training Participants</td><td><b>531 </b>Participants attended Customs Training</td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td><b>3,219</b> SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

Particularly, as we draw closer to full employment, it is essential we continue to provide enterprise in Ireland with a high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent pool. My Department closely monitors the trends in labour market employment rates. As of Q1 2019, the employment rate of women aged 15-64 in Ireland is 64.3%. This is higher than the EU average, which is 63.5%.</p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is committed to a more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of our workforce. As such it has identified increasing participation in the labour force as one of its key pillars. Future Jobs Ireland sets the target of a substantial 3 percentage point increase in overall participation rates for people aged 25 to 69 years by 2025 with higher increases for females and older people.  In order to achieve this target, the framework details relevant ambitions underpinned by deliverables. The ambitions and deliverables relevant to increasing female participation include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>-Encouraging participation in the labour force through high-quality Early Learning and Care. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables to complement the implementation of the Affordable Childcare Scheme including the introduction of additional ways to reduce costs, enhance supply and improve quality.</p><p>-Fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. This ambition assists in the development of an inclusive society. It is underpinned by a number of deliverables including the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave to allow for greater flexibility of parents.</p><p>Improving incentives to participate in the labour force. This ambition includes a deliverable to consider income tax arrangements for second earners that optimise financial incentives to work, taking account of the impact that the income tax system may have on female participation in the workforce.</p><p>-Encouraging adult dependents and beneficiaries of other full-time welfare payments to engage in activation, enter and/or stay in the workforce. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables such as the development of a return to work service as part of the Public Employment Service offering; assisting women returned to work in the technology sector through Skillnets Ireland Women ReBOOT programme; and a review of recent analyses of inactivity to identify policy issues to support the development of policy responses.</p><p>Undertaking promotional campaigns to encourage greater levels of participation in the labour force. This ambition is underpinned by deliverables including a communications campaign to promote awareness of the Public Employment Service as a real recruitment option, especially for those groups with lower participation rates; and the development of promotions for female participation as part of Jobs Week 2019 and Jobs Fairs.</p><p>Employment rates by sex, age and citizenship (%), European Labour Force Survey, Eurostat, Q1 2019</p></reply>

Under the scheme, an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention by the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term.</p>  <p>  This scheme was developed as it was considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that my Department can respond swiftly to changing circumstances, as necessary.   However, there are many other supports in place that enterprises can avail of which should prevent them from reaching the point where they are in severe difficulty and at risk of going out of business.  However, we also recognise the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and therefore this scheme is part of a belt and braces approach to supporting enterprise.  </p>  <p>  To date, no applications for support have been received under the Rescue and Restructuring scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.1115.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100074#WRS02300"><p>The discussions at the informal EU Competitiveness Council, which took place on 5th July, were on the theme of sustainable growth.  Ministers focussed on integrating the single market, the digital economy and a modern industrial policy.  In the afternoon, the Council discussed smart solutions for a competitive and climate neutral Europe.  Trade matters are discussed by a different Council formation, whereas the Competitiveness Council - or COMPET - is generally composed of &quot;industry&quot; Ministers.</p><p>With regard to your request for an overview of EU Trade agreements and trade discussions, the EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), go beyond the reduction or elimination of conventional tariff barriers to include: </p><p>- non-tariff and regulatory barriers, services, </p><p>- investment, </p><p>- recognition of professional qualifications, </p><p>- intellectual property rights, </p><p>- access to public procurement, </p><p>- regulatory cooperation, </p><p>- sustainable development, </p><p>- labour and environment.  </p><p>They help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish-based firms.</p><p>The latest up-to-date information on specific FTAs is as follows: </p><p>EU-Canada (CETA) - On 21st September 2017, CETA was &quot;provisionally applied&quot;, under which EU/Irish companies gain access to the removal of customs duties and substantially improved access to the Canadian public procurement market. CETA also opened up new sectors of the Canadian services market, reduced regulatory barriers and provided more transparent rules for market access.  </p><p>Ireland already has a strong trading relationship with Canada which is reflected in the &euro;3.2 billion worth of annual trade between both countries.  The value of Irish exports to Canada is worth &euro;2.4 billion whilst the value of Irish imports from Canada is worth &euro;780 million.  </p><p>EU-Japan - The EU-Japan Economic Partnership (EPA) was signed in Tokyo on the 17th July 2018.  The European Parliament and Japan's National Diet voted to ratify the EPA in December 2018 and the Agreement entered into force on 1st February 2019.  Tariff reductions will be delivered on a phased basis over a period of up to 15 years.  It is expected that the Agreement will open up new opportunities for Irish exporters and companies across a wide range of sectors, including the agri-food sector, which will see particular benefits with new access for dairy products and beef. It will also facilitate greater ease in doing business in the financial services, med-tech, and green energy sectors and across the full range of trade interests that Ireland and Japan share. The Agreement also creates opportunities for Irish-based manufacturers in our pharmaceutical sector through an expansion of existing Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice to cover new pharmaceutical products.</p><p>EU-Mexico - On 21 April 2018, the EU and Mexico announced that they had reached Political Agreement in their negotiations to modernise the existing EU-Mexico Global Agreement to broaden its scope to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common phytosanitary standards (food safety and animal and plant health), sustainable development, rules of origin, public procurement.  The EU and Mexico hope to finalise the full legal text before the end of the year.  The final text will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature. The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, this will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and beef products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives.  There are also many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including in the automotive, aeronautics, electronics, financial and telecommunications sector.</p><p>EU-Singapore - The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed by the EU and Singapore at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit on 19th October 2018.  The FTA was ratified by the European Parliament on 12 February 2019.  The aim is for the FTA to enter into force during 2019.  The deal goes beyond many other free trade accords in committing to open up public procurement, an area where the EU has many leading suppliers, and agreeing on technical standards in areas such as motor vehicles, electronics and green technologies.</p><p>EU-Vietnam - A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was successfully negotiated with Vietnam in 2015.  The European Commission and Vietnam signed the FTA on 30 June 2019 in Hanoi.  The hope is that it will be ratified by the European Parliament during 2019.  The EU-Vietnam FTA will eliminate over 99% of tariffs and will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish exports.  The FTA will also create opportunities by addressing other barriers to trade and will address trade-related areas such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development.  The Agreement creates opportunities for the Irish Agri-food sector, in particular. Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years and the FTA will support further growth.  There are opportunities for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood, and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated under the FTA. The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers.</p><p>EU-Mercosur - The EU has recently reached political agreement on FTA with the Mercosur region (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay).  The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.  The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion.  It aims to reduced and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  In 2018, Ireland exported &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region.  In 2017 &ndash; the latest year for which data is available &ndash; services exports to Mercosur totalled almost &euro;1.5 billion.  Trade with this region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  This Agreement will see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.  The final text of the Agreement will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and translated into the various EU and Mercosur languages.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature - a process we believe will take 2 years based on previous FTAs.</p><p>EU-Australia and New Zealand - Negotiations for separate FTAs with Australia and New Zealand commenced in July 2018.  Three rounds of negotiations have been held with the most recent taking place from 25th-29th March 2019.  The fourth round is expected to take place during July 2019.  Good progress has been made in many areas to date, however more challenging discussions are also anticipated on sensitive issues such as recognition of the EU&rsquo;s Geographic Indicators for food and beverages, and in finding agreement on the structure of tariff offers.  To date there have been four rounds of negotiations for an EU-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement with the most recent taking place from 13th-17th May 2019 in Wellington.  Overall, progress has been constructive with some chapters capable of being closed.</p><p>EU-Chile - The EU and Chile launched negotiations for a modernised Association Agreement in November 2017.  There have been three rounds of discussions to date, the latest taking place in Brussels, 28 May-1st June 2018.  Over the course of the round the negotiating teams discussed all the issues covered by the Agreement.  While no date has been confirmed for the fourth round of negotiations, both sides agreed on work in relation to various areas, and contact will continue to this effect to continue advancing in all areas of preparation for the next round of negotiations.</p><p>Indonesia - Indonesia is a member of the ASEAN group.  The first FTA negotiations with Indonesia took place in September 2016.  The eighth round of negotiations took place in Jakarta from 17 - 21 June 2019.  The potential for further progress before October is limited as Indonesia will not have a new government in place until then following elections in April.  The negotiations are approximately at the half-way point.  Good progress has been made in a number of areas, however more difficult discussions undoubtedly lie ahead.</p><p>EU-US trade discussions - On the 25th July 2018, European Commission President Juncker and President Trump met in Washington to launch a new phase in the close friendship and strong trade relations between the United States and the European Union.  They agreed a Joint EU-US Statement to &ndash;</p><p>- work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,</p><p>- strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,</p><p>- launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and</p><p>- work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.</p><p>An EU-US Executive Working Group (EWG), was established on foot of the July joint statement, co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m and the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.  The EWG is vehicle for carrying forward this joint agenda and is scheduled to meet again in early May 2019.</p><p>On 15 April 2019 the<b></b>EU Council voted by qualified majority to approve the negotiating directives for the commencement of trade negotiations with the US in the sectors of conformity assessment (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic) and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products).  The approval of the negotiating directives is a key step on the road to a possible future trade agreement between the EU and US.  Furthermore, these mandates will enable the EU Commission, in consultation with Member States, to work towards removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to EU-US trade in industrial goods, key goals of the July 2018 Joint Statement of EU Commission President Juncker and US President Trump.</p><p>A recent economic analysis released by the EU Commission found that a targeted EU-US agreement eliminating tariffs on industrial goods would increase EU exports to the US by 8% and US exports to the EU by 9% by 2033.  In this context where Ireland and the US have a bilateral trading relationship worth more than &euro;100 billion per annum, the potential gains for Ireland, and resultant employment, from an EU-US trade agreement would be very positive.  </p><p>It will be a matter for the EWG to determine the timing of future EU-US trade negotiations.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to proposed duties on EU imports, I assume that this refers to two long-running disputes between the EU and US regarding alleged subsidies provided to their respective commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing (US) and Airbus (EU).  In both cases the WTO has found that the EU in relation to Airbus, and Washington State in relation to Boeing, provided subsidies to support these airlines in contravention of WTO rules.</p><p>The US has requested the authority to impose countermeasures worth $11.2 billion, commensurate with their estimation as to the adverse effects caused by EU subsidies to Airbus.  However, a WTO arbitrator is currently evaluating the claim and the report is due before the end of 2019 such that the amount has yet to be determined.  However, in advance of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, the US published in April 2019 a draft list of products that may attract increased tariffs.  This US list is divided into two sections, the first included aircraft related products and is targeted at the four Member States (France, Germany, Spain and the UK) that provided support to Airbus the second section targets a wide range of products to be applied across all 28 EU Member States.  Included in both sections are products that Ireland exports in significant volumes to the US, including aircraft and aircraft parts, butter, cheese and liqueurs. </p><p>On 1st July the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) published a supplementary list of product lines which may be subject to increased tariffs.  The list includes agricultural products exported by the EU 28.  Dairy spreads, Italian cheeses, olives, coffee and pasta are all included, as are Irish and Scotch whiskies, as well as pork products.  This supplemental list adds 89 tariff subheadings with an approximate trade value of $4 billion to the initial list published in April.  In line with its standard procedures, the USTR has invited written submissions on the supplemental list and will hold a public hearing on 5th August 2019.</p><p>It is important to note that the US lists (initial and supplemental) are only proposed lists and it will be for the WTO arbitrator in the case to determine the amount of possible damage.  Only after the WTO Arbitration report is issued can the US choose products to impose tariffs on and only up to a value that matches the amount awarded. </p><p>The EU has stressed that the arbitrator in the Airbus case has yet to release its report which could permit the EU to impose tariffs on the US to the value of the arbitration findings,</p><p>Importantly, the EU remains open for discussions with the United States on both cases and believes the US estimate of $11billion worth of tariffs to be greatly exaggerated.  Ireland continues to support the EU position of seeking a negotiated resolution to the Airbus/Boeing disputes that is to the benefit of both sides and has encouraged discussions to start as early as possible to this end. </p><p>Finally, at a national level, my Department continues to monitor the potential impacts of the trade measures being proposed by the US.  Officials in my Department continue to engage with the European Commission on the matter as it is important that we maintain a common EU position, principally given that the EU Commission has competency on trade matters under the EU Treaties.</p></reply>

The Group comprises senior representatives from DG Comp, my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland.  Its objective has been to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  </p>  <p>  Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.  Options available through the Agriculture Guidelines are also being developed to support large food companies. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with Commissioner Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of these Working Group discussions.</p></reply>

The DTIF will see investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis. The successful projects represent the health, food, ICT and manufacturing sectors in Ireland. </p>  <p>  There are 104 organisations involved across the 27 projects that will receive funding and these include large enterprises, SMEs, colleges and public research bodies. Several colleges and public research bodies are involved in multiple projects.  There are 18 successful projects involving partners based outside Dublin and they are located country-wide in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Monaghan, Waterford, Louth and Tipperary.</p>  <p>  As indicated in December 2018, the 27 projects involve a request for DTIF funding of approximately &euro;75 million of which &euro;20 million is due to be drawn down during 2019. The DTIF is being administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  Contracts are now being finalised by Enterprise Ireland in respect of each of the 27 projects and grant drawdown will commence shortly.  With this Fund, as with typical grant funding programmes, most recipients will have to incur up to six months of costs before grant payments will issue.

While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland are actively supporting Irish companies to prepare and take action. </p>  <p>  The LEOs and Enterprise Ireland are providing companies with mentorship and training programmes to prepare for any kind of Brexit. These include:</p>  <p>  - The Brexit SME Scorecard online tool is an important first step in helping small businesses think about how their businesses may be impacted by Brexit. Developed by Enterprise Ireland, questions in the scorecard are built around six key business pillars to help SMEs self-diagnose how prepared they are. A comprehensive report is automatically generated to assist with planning and to highlight what further supports are available.</p>  <p>  - The Brexit Act On Programme has been developed to focus on three main areas of capability: (1) Financial and Currency Management; (2) Strategic Sourcing; and, (3) Customs and Logistics.  Delivered over the course of two half day sessions with an independent consultant, the initiative assists companies decide on specific actions over a short period to address some of the risks and opportunities from Brexit.</p>  <p>  - The Brexit Mentor Programme was developed for businesses to work with an experienced mentor on a one-to-one basis to identify key areas of exposure within their business. With advice and guidance from their mentor, businesses develop strategies that are more robust, which address issues and maximise potential opportunities around Brexit.</p>  <p>  - Prepare Your Business for Customs is a one-day interactive workshop, run regionally by Local Enterprise Offices, which provides businesses with a better understanding of the potential impacts, formalities and procedures to be adopted when trading with a country which is outside the Single Market and Custom Unions. Open to all businesses, these workshops cover areas such as what export and import procedures apply, how tariffs work and how to correctly classify goods.</p>  <p>  - Customs Insights course from Enterprise Ireland which helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to move goods from, to and through the UK. The online course, which is open to companies of all sizes, provides learners with a firm understanding of the customs implications for their business and the options from Revenue to make this process more efficient.</p>  <p>  - LEAN for Micro which has been adapted by Enterprise Ireland for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well as building resilience within their companies. Under this programme, clients can avail of five days of consultancy with a Lean Expert (a qualified practitioner), who will work with the company to introduce lean principles, undertake a specific cost reduction project and assist the company in benchmarking its performance.</p>  <p>  - Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME) Grant supports clients to explore and develop new export market opportunities, such as participation in international trade fairs and development of export related marketing and websites. With a focus on helping companies to diversify, this scheme is a match-funding opportunity with up to &euro;2,500 available.</p>  <p>  - The Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) which is the world&rsquo;s largest support network for small and medium-sized enterprises that have international growth ambitions. The EEN is active in more than 60 countries around the globe, bringing 3,000 experts together from more than 600-member organisations. Through the Local Enterprise Offices, the EEN can help small businesses get expert advice, source technologies and identify trusted business partners.</p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant, launched in June 2017 by Enterprise Ireland, supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. This grant support, of up to &euro;5,000, can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and out of pocket expenses associated with researching the direction of their Brexit action plan. </p></reply>

Trade financing and credit insurance products can help SMEs by bridging the gap between exporters&rsquo; and importers&rsquo; differing expectations about when payment should be made. </p>  <p>  Under the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, a High Level Group chaired by my Department was established to progress the development of an export finance strategy for Ireland. The group's work led to the development of the Brexit Loan Scheme, which provides low cost working capital at favourable terms and conditions to businesses impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department will work together with the Department of Finance to build on the learnings from this Scheme in further achieving the availability of appropriate financing supports for exporting Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  In addition, SBCI has been working with non-bank finance providers to improve the availability of market solutions for SMEs with regard to trade finance options. For example, a new trade finance product was developed by Bibby Financial Services in collaboration with SBCI making available &euro;70 million in funding to Irish SMEs. The new product allows businesses to buy, receive and sell goods before needing to pay for them and it is ideally suited to Irish SMEs needing to bridge the gap between paying suppliers and receiving payment from customers.</p>  <p>  While the nature of the UK's departure from the EU still remains to be determined, Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. Supports such as the Brexit Loan Scheme are designed to provide short-term finance and with Brexit on the horizon, investment in working capital diversification has never been more important.</p></reply>

In response to this challenge, Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, identified the need to run Skills Analysis Workshops around the country, which would provide client companies with an appropriate toolkit to assess their skill needs. </p>  <p>  Under this collaborative programme, Enterprise Ireland rolled out the Spotlight on Skills Workshops, which were designed and delivered by the Irish Management Institute.  The Spotlight on Skills workshops are part of the Skills for Growth Initiative, which is led by the Department of Education and Skills.  The aim of these workshops is to assist companies to identify their skills needs to support the growth of their business. </p>  <p>  The output from these workshops deepens Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s understanding of the specific skills needs within EI client companies and, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills and the Regional Skills Fora managers, helps to inform engagement with the Higher Education, Further Education and other training providers to tailor future supports to assist client companies to meet their skill requirements. </p>  <p>  The workshops were open to all Enterprise Ireland client companies and aimed at members of the senior management team. The programme aims to empower the SME client base to examine and articulate their skills requirements.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that after completion of the workshop and follow-on implementation support, participants will have: adopted a framework to assess the skill needs of their business and applied this tool or framework within the company, and they will have the ability to communicate with confidence the current and future skills needs of their business for engagement with the Regional Skills Managers, Enterprise Ireland, key stakeholders including the Regional Skills Fora and the Higher or Further Education institutes or other training providers.</p>  <p>  A total of 23 Spotlight on Skills Workshops have taken place to date between Q4 2017 to Q2 2019 across the following regions; North East, North West, West, Midlands, Mid-East, Mid-West, Dublin, South East and the South West. A total of 223 companies have participated in the workshops, with 371 individual participants having attended. The industry sectors that have participated include; Food, ICT &amp;amp; International Services, Industrial, Life Science and Consumer.</p>  <p>  Since the commencement of this initiative in 2017, Enterprise Ireland has to date paid approximately &euro;169,000 to support its implementation.</p></reply>

Competition among suppliers focuses on attracting new customers with lower introductory prices with the result that customers who stay with the same supplier can end up paying higher prices.  As such penalties may have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable consumers such as those on low incomes or those who have difficulty in accessing online offers, I share the Deputy's view that this is an issue that needs to be examined and, where required, addressed. </p>  <p>  The information available to me suggests however that loyalty penalties are concentrated in a small number of sectors where contracts are automatically renewed or rolled over or are of indefinite duration, principally electronic communications services, energy, banking and insurance.  As these are regulated sectors for which I have no direct responsibility, the Deputy's question is more appropriate to the Ministers with responsibility for the sectors concerned.</p></reply>

It also produces research and statements on the cost of doing business, productivity and other areas relevant to the competitiveness agenda.</p><p>As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am responsible for presenting the findings of the NCC to the Taoiseach and Government.</p><p>The Deputy is referring to a recommendation in the 2017 Competitiveness Challenge. In the intervening period there have been significant developments in the national training fund, which were noted in the 2018 Competitiveness Challenge<i>. </i></p><p>As part of the process announced in Budget 2018, of increasing the NTF levy to 1% of reckonable earnings by 2020, an independent review of the Fund was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills to examine a number of strategic policy and operational issues associated with the NTF and to inform its future direction. My Department and its enterprise development agencies inputted into this review, which was published in August 2018.</p><p>The review had a number of key recommendations, which relate directly to enhancing support for in-company training, including:</p><p>- A focus on close to labour market skill requirements, and in targeted interventions to support enterprise training and prepare individuals to take up employment opportunities</p><p>- Introduce greater information sharing and coordination across programmes to increase employer buy-in</p><p>- Increase focus on supporting in-company training underpinning increased productivity and innovation capacity particularly in SMEs</p><p>- Fund SME upskilling as a target theme in Higher Education competitive funding programmes</p><p>- Implement a structured process to facilitate NTF focused inputs from employers, employees and representative bodies prior to annual expenditure decisions </p><p>The Review indicated that the NTF should be more responsive to employer needs, highlighting the importance of increasing the role of employers in determining the priorities and strategic direction of the fund and the need for additional and refocused expenditure on programmes relevant to employers.</p><p>An Implementation Plan to deliver on these recommendations was published by the Department of Education and Skills alongside Budget 2019 and is now being actioned. Budget 2019 also began the process of aligning the Fund with the recommendations set out in the Review, in particular those related to close to labour market and in-company training.</p><p>As the economy approaches full employment, the reforms to the Fund and the associated reorientation of expenditure will be key supports to the objectives set out in Future Jobs Ireland<i>- </i>a central part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term, to ensure we are well positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead.</p><p>The pace of technological change means that workers across all skills levels must be prepared to reskill and upskill throughout their working careers. This is a theme that is emphasised in Future Jobs Ireland,<i></i>which aims to boost participation in lifelong learning from 8.9% to 18% in 2025.</p><p>To this end, Future Jobs<i></i>highlights the reforms to the National Training Fund and sets out a series of actions related to the implementation or expansion of in-employment programmes supported under the Fund- apprenticeship and traineeship offerings, the EXPLORE Digital Skills programme, Skillnet Ireland&rsquo;s training provision, especially in the area of emerging technologies, SOLAS&rsquo; Skills to Advance initiative, Springboard+, and the forthcoming Human Capital Initiative.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the National Training Fund is fully aligned with the skills needs of enterprise, that it works to support the increasing in-company training needs of firms, and that it contributes to realising the ambitious lifelong learning target set out in Future Jobs Ireland.</p></reply>

My colleague, Minister Breen, attended meetings of the Council on 30th November 2017, 12th March 2018, 28th May 2018 and 16th July 2018.  The meeting on the 27th September 2018 was attended by the Permanent Representative and I attended the meeting on 29th of November 2018. </p>  <p>  To date in 2019 the meetings on 18 February and 27 May were attended by the Deputy Permanent Representative, the meeting on 2 May was attended by an official from my Department and the meeting on 5 July was attended by Minister Breen.</p>  <p>  State Aid rules did not feature on the agenda of these meetings.  The Competitiveness Council is a consultative committee and is not a forum for direct representations from Member States.   Changes to State Aid rules is therefore not part of the remit of the Council.</p>  <p>  However, my Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit.  My Department has been working closely with the EU Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid which was established following a meeting between my predecessor, Francis Fitzgerald and the Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The Group comprises senior representatives from DG Comp, my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland.  Its objective has been to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  </p>  <p>  Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.  Options available through the Agriculture Guidelines are also being developed to support large food companies. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with Commissioner Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Should further issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of these Working Group discussions.</p></reply>

Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Given its significant exposure to the UK market, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contributed 40% of the State funding. As a result, at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the number of applicants for the Brexit loan scheme, the latest data available to my Department show that, at close of business on 5 July, 669 eligibility applications were received by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, of which 608 were deemed eligible by it. Of the 608 eligible applicants, 150 have progressed to sanction with their banks. The value of the sanctioned loans from banks on 28 June was &euro;32.93 million. </p>  <p>  To date, 107  food businesses have applied for eligibility under the Brexit Loan Scheme while 28  food businesses have been sanctioned financing for a total value of &euro;7.98 million. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Brexit loan scheme, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Finance and with the support of the European Investment Bank guarantee, has developed the Future Growth Loan Scheme. The scheme is making up to &euro;300 million worth of loans available with a term of eight to ten years and is open to eligible Irish businesses, as well as the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic long-term investment. Finance provided under the scheme is competitively priced and has favourable terms, for example, no security is required for loans up to &euro;500,000. The scheme opened for eligibility applications on 17 April since then the SBCI has received 524 eligibility applications and issued 482 eligibility letters. With Brexit on the horizon, the availability of both the Brexit loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme means that qualifying Irish businesses will have access to low cost capital without delay. It forms part of the supports in place for Irish business to cope with potential Brexit challenges.</p></reply>

As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Increasing the international sales of Irish companies translates into sustaining and creating high-quality, sustainable jobs across the country &ndash; something that this Government is firmly focused on through the Future Jobs Ireland framework. In support of this, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, in September 2018. The &euro;1.25m fund, is targeted at retailers with an online presence to encourage acceleration of their online offerings and can be used to fund research, strategy development, implementation and training.  </p>  <p>  The fund will provide grants between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a match fund basis with the purpose of enhancing their online offering. Applications for funding under this pilot Scheme are considered on a competitive basis under calls for applications. Once the fund criteria is met, at least half of the total number of funds will be awarded to Irish retail businesses based outside of Dublin. By delivering the Online Retail Scheme, I intend to support Irish retailers to innovate, and through innovation, increase their competitiveness and international reach.</p>  <p>  The first call opened on 24th October 2018 and closed on 5th December 2018, I announced the eleven successful applicants on 1st March 2019 in Skibbereen, Co. Cork. The approved applications were in sectors ranging from; pharmacy, giftware, lifestyle, entertainment, outdoor clothing and equipment, garden furniture and safety equipment. Following the first call, my Officials in conjunction with EI, undertook a review of the feedback on Call 1 to examine ways in which the Scheme offering could be strengthened.</p>  <p>  On foot of that, I approved that the eligibility criteria of the scheme be expanded to widen the reach of the scheme. The scheme will now accept applications from Irish-based retailers with 10 or more full-time employees (including over 250 employees). Call 1 of the Online Retail Scheme was open to applications from Irish owned retail businesses with 20 or more employees, and who have a physical retail outlet. By opening up the Scheme  to more retailers for Call 2,  I expect to see even stronger interest and volume of applications. </p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland delivered advisory clinics for retailers at the Retail Excellence Retail Retreat Conference 21-22 May, 2019. The clinics offered retailers an opportunity to raise questions or issues in relation to the application process for Call 2 of the pilot Online Retail Scheme and receive expert advice from Enterprise Ireland. </p>  <p>  Peer learning is an integral aspect of the pilot Online Retail Scheme in order to encourage knowledge sharing. Enterprise Ireland have already held online retail specific workshops with the successful entrants from Call 1 and further workshops are planned for the successful applicants from Call 2.</p>  <p>  The second call of the pilot Online Retail Scheme opened for applications on 19 June 2019 and will close at 3pm on 31 July 2019. I look forward to announcing the successful applicants from Call 2 later this year. </p></reply>

The IDA operates a Business and Technology Park in Ardmore with marketable lands and also owns land in the Clonmore area. These lands are being actively marketed by the IDA to prospective and existing clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. In addition to this, the Agency also actively engage with owners of privately owned buildings and lands in the Mullingar area as potential locations for investment. </p>  <p>  County Westmeath has benefitted from the RPP. In 2014, the IDA successfully constructed an ATU in Athlone and secured Aerie Pharmaceuticals as a tenant. Under the current first phase of the RPP, the construction of an Advanced Office Building (AOB) in Athlone is expected to begin late this year or in 2020. In the second phase of the RPP, construction will begin on an additional AOB for Athlone in 2020. Once the first and second phases of the RPP are completed there will be a total of three buildings constructed in Westmeath and I am confident that these will stimulate further investment and job creation for the entire county. My Department will continue to keep the IDA's property requirements under review in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the FDI trend in Westmeath is positive. There are currently 21 IDA client companies located in the County, employing 3,466 people. Three of these companies are located in Mullingar, employing approximately 150 people. The wider County has seen an almost 17% increase in FDI employment from 2017 to 2018 and the IDA actively engages with its client base to support them in growing their business and footprint further. </p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May 2018.</p><p>In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website at</p><p>.</p><p>This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. </p><p>Nationally, the HSE is providing approximately &euro;7.9 million for Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages this year to facilitate people with dementia who have complex needs to remain living at home.

The HSE in addition plays a key role at a local level via Inter-Agency groups to plan and deliver the health services required in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres and in the locations where the refugees are eventually housed.  Elements of health screening, registration with GPs, access to medical cards, provision of a range of primary care services have been integral to optimal resettlement of groups of refugees across the country. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the HSE implemented initiatives to improve access to primary care services for refugees in emergency reception and orientation centres. These included chronic disease management, mental health supports and the oral health needs of children and adults.  This work will continue in 2019.</p>  <p>  The HSE is developing a health vulnerability assessment, as part of the vulnerability assessment under the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU.

RTA 408 (also known as omaveloxolone) is an investigational medicinal product currently undergoing clinical trials. The publicly accessible European clinical trials register lists two ongoing trials registered on the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT). Both are Phase II clinical trials, one of which is specifically investigating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of RTA 408 in the treatment of Friedreich&rsquo;s Ataxia.</p><p>Phase II trials test the efficacy of a drug and aim to find out:</p><p>- if the new treatment works well enough to be tested in a larger phase III trial</p><p>- which diseases the treatment works for</p><p>- more about side effects and how to manage them</p><p>- more about the best dose to use.</p><p>If phase II clinical trials prove successful, trials can advance to phase III.</p><p>A medicinal product cannot be placed on the market in Ireland unless it has a marketing authorisation granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority or a centralised marketing authorisation issued by the European Commission. Following a successful application by the pharmaceutical company RTA 408 it has been designated as an orphan drug by the Commission. Therefore, a marketing authorisation application can only be submitted to the European Medicines Agency on behalf of the Commission. </p><p>For a medicinal product to be granted a marketing authorisation an applicant company must submit a dossier of all the trials and studies undertaken on the drug substance and the final pharmaceutical product, in order to provide evidence that the medicine adheres to clear and predefined standards of quality safety and efficacy relevant to its proposed therapeutic use. This dossier normally includes the results of phase III clinical trials.</p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p><p>In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, the company must submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted a marketing authorisation.</p></reply>

As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) in relation to extending the national immunisation schedule to include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of boys in first year of secondary school.  </p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision has been made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  The HSE National Immunisation Office has developed information materials and a communication strategy for a gender neutral HPV programme which will be available for parents and healthcare professionals in advance of the start of the gender neutral programme. </p></reply>

The main drivers of the deficit are acute hospitals, PCRSand demand led schemes, disability services, and the treatment abroad scheme. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan (NSP) is an important accountability instrument in use by the Department in determining how the HSE is performing against its targets as it captures in a clear and quantified way the range of health and social care services to be provided by the HSE for the allocation it has received.  It establishes links between funding, staffing and services and it incorporates activity measures, outcome-based performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, which are matched with targets and timescales.</p>  <p>  The Department provides oversight of the performance of the HSE in relation to the delivery of the services set out in the NSP.  The mechanism for this oversight includes the ongoing monthly performance management process in place between the Management Board in the Department and the HSE Leadership (now the HSE Executive Management Team) where the HSE reports monthly to the Department on the performance of the health system against the agreed targets set out in the NSP.</p>  <p>  As part of the monthly performance cycle, the HSE provides an update on the application of its Performance and Accountability Framework.  This includes the submission of an Escalation report which provides detail on services which are in escalation for the month in question and the actions being carried out to mitigate these.  Services in escalation are those which are experiencing significant performance issues.</p>  <p>  The latest escalation report is for April 2019 and currently the HSE are reporting 7 areas (6 in acute hospitals and 1 in social care) which have been escalated to the National Performance Oversight Group.  Improvement plans and support measures are in place to monitor the ongoing performance of the different areas in escalation.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles. </p>  <p>  The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has been established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. </p>  <p>  In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p>  <p>  The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.</p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above.</p>  <p>  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this work, the HSE is also examining options to address service requirements for patients with immediate or urgent needs. </p>  <p>  As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE has prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019, which I hope provides further clarity on this issue. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the HSE has advised that a detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department and this report is awaited.  </p>  <p>  At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE.  Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May 2018.</p><p>In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered, including in those counties that currently do not have access to a dementia adviser. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website at <i></i>.  This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  </p><p>The National Dementia Strategy requires the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites.  In this context, an evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service, which was published in September 2018, recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide. </p><p>There are nine Dementia Advisers working in the Dementia Adviser Service established by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (ASI) in mid-2014.

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume Inpatient/Day Case procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p><p>In addition, the NTPF will arrange 8,000 procedures across an expanded range of over 65 other procedures in 2019.</p><p>In relation to the particular question raised by the Deputy, the attached tables provide details of the number of procedures procured by the NTPF since 2017.</p><p>The NTPF has provided the following additional information: </p><p>With regard to Inpatient / Day case (IP / DC), the following procedures are provided in Private Hospitals, funded through the NTPF:</p><p>Adenoidectomy</p><p>Angiogram</p><p>Arthoscopy of Ankle DC</p><p>Arthoscopy of Ankle IP</p><p>Arthoscopy of Shoulder DC</p><p>Arthoscopy of Shoulder IP</p><p>Arthroscopy of knee DC</p><p>Arthroscopy of shoulder, diagnostic with or without synovial biopsy</p><p>Arthroscopy of shoulder, surgical, with removal of loose body or foreign body, synovectomy debridement</p><p>Bilateral hernia repair</p><p>Cardioversion</p><p>Carpal Tunnel</p><p>Cataracts</p><p>Cervical Discectomy IP</p><p>Circumcision DC Adults</p><p>Circumcision IP Adults</p><p>Circumcision DC Paeds</p><p>Circumcision IP Paeds</p><p>Colonoscopy</p><p>Correction of Protruding ears (Bilateral)</p><p>Cystoscopy Day case</p><p>Endoscopy / Gastroscopy</p><p>Excision Lesion General</p><p>Excision Lesion Plastics</p><p>Excision of hydrocele, bilateral</p><p>Excision of hydrocele, unilateral</p><p>Grommets</p><p>Hip Replacement</p><p>Hysteroscopy with dilatation and curettage (diagnostic or therapeutic)</p><p>Interruption of sapheno-femoral junction varicose veins</p><p>Knee Replacement</p><p>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy daycase and inpatient</p><p>Laparoscopy with/without D&amp;amp;C and with/without biopsy</p><p>Lumbar Discectomy IP</p><p>Myringoplasty</p><p>Myringotomy bilateral and Grommets Paeds DC</p><p>Myringotomy bilateral paeds DC</p><p>Nasal / Sinus Endoscopy DC</p><p>Nasal / Sinus Endoscopy IP</p><p>Protoscopy / Sigmoidoscopy DC</p><p>Repair of incisional hernia</p><p>Repair of umbilical hernia</p><p>Resection Ingrown Toenail DC</p><p>Rhinoplasty DC</p><p>Removal of Pin Screw Wire DC</p><p>Removal of Pin Screw Wire IP</p><p>Removal of Plate Rod Nail DC</p><p>Removal of Plate Rod Nail IP</p><p>Septoplasty DC</p><p>Septoplasty IP</p><p>Septorhinoplasty - ENT </p><p>Septorhinoplasty - Plastics</p><p>Strabismus procedure involving 1 or 2 muscles, one eye</p><p>Surgical removal of unspecified number of teeth requiring removal of bone - to be performed by a maxillofacial surgeon</p><p>Tonsils Adult</p><p>Tonsils Paeds</p><p>Transurethral resection of prostate [TURP]</p><p>Tympanoplasty IP Adult </p><p>Tympanoplasty DC Adult</p><p>Tympanoplasty IP Paeds </p><p>Tympanoplasty DC Paeds</p><p>Ureteroscop</p><p>Urethroscopy, diagnostic, with or without biopsy </p><p>Varicose Veins</p><p>The above is not an exhaustive list but covers most of the current procedures.

This reply was taken as a composite with 31016/19, 31017/19, 31018/19 and 31019/19. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health takes the management of patient safety very seriously. In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health. The NPSO was established in December 2016 to oversee a programme of patient safety measures. The programme of patient safety centres on initiatives such as the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of patient experience and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda. </p>  <p>  In line with international best practice, the Department has been driving a progressive legislative framework to build an open and just culture for patient safety which balances the need for an open and honest reporting culture that facilitates a learning environment, and quality healthcare with accountability for both individuals and organisations. Disclosure and reporting are opportunities to learn, to improve, to address errors that have happened and to apply the lessons to make the service safer for the next patient and the patient after that. The programme of legislation being progressed includes the Patient Safety Bill, which will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events, and a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high-risk activities. </p>  <p>  In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents. These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.   </p>  <p>  Finally, in 2018 the Health Service Executive (HSE) launched it new Incident Management Framework and in June 2019 launched their interim revision of the Open Disclosure policy: &ldquo;Communicating with Patients Following Patient Safety Incidents&rdquo; replacing the HSE Open Disclosure Policy 2013. The Department will shortly establish a new Independent Patient Safety Council. I have recently appointed the Chair of the Council. The first task of the Council will be to undertake a detailed review of the existing policies on Open Disclosure across the whole healthcare landscape. The Independent Patient Safety Council will include strong patient and public representation and international patient safety expertise.</p></reply>

The Pathfinder team should develop mandatory protocols which will work to safeguard young people against potential changes in policy that could negatively impact on youth mental health<br /><br />1.2 - Policies involving young people should be published in simple, straightforward language that young people can understand<br /><br />1.3 - A process of youth consultation should be carried out when designing mental health and other support services and facilities for young people<br /><br />1.4 - An independent National Youth Mental Health Advocacy and Information Service should be established. Consultation should be informed by children and young people and should include the HSE, which is developing a tender for a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) youth advocacy pilot.</td><td>Work has been advanced to establish a Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Team. There has been considerable communication and work performed in addressing outstanding governance, staffing and funding issues. Activities are not yet complete in fully developing and rolling out a Pathfinder unit, but work is on-going. <br /><br />At the end of May Minister Daly had a constructive meeting with Minister Donohoe and his officials. They are very supportive of the proposal, subject to resolving the outstanding matters. I hope to make substantial progress on the matter in the coming months. <br /><br />Policies involving young people are issued to the young people&rsquo;s forum in DCYA for review prior to publication.<br /><br />This is to be a part of the Pathfinder project once agreed.<br /><br />A pilot adult inpatient advocacy service is being rolled out in St Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital and the HSE will use the learning&rsquo;s from this pilot to determine how best to establish a young advocacy service. Work has been completed to determine the merits of establishing the advocacy service as (i)a separate structure independent of the HSE, (ii) a structure within the Child Ombudsman or indeed (iii) a new NGO agency. A draft business plan has been drafted and data from the HSE pilot will provide a template for how best to proceed in an Irish context. </td></tr><tr><td>Awareness and Training<br /><br />2.1 - A series of sustained and evidence based awareness campaigns should be developed, specifically targeted at children and young people, to improve mental health, emotional literacy, build resilience, and aid the development of coping mechanisms<br /><br />2.2 - Sustained, quality-assured and evidenced-based training programmes should be funded to provide support to individuals in the public, voluntary and community sectors who have contact with young people so that those trained might be in a better position to promote positive mental health</td><td>The HSE have been examining International awareness initiatives that might be applicable in this jurisdiction. <br /><br />Little Things Mental Health Campaign for 2nd level students:<br /><br />HSE Mental Health has been running the Little Things Campaign since 2014 to promote protection and improvement of mental health for the whole population. The campaign focuses on 9 protective factors that can help build resilience and improve mental health and wellbeing. There were 87,000 followers of Little things on social media in 2017. There were 3.2m visits to yourmentalhealth.ie between 2014 and 2017.<br /><br />In 2017 work commenced on adapting the Little Things Campaign to tailor the messaging and make it more relevant to young people, who are also listed within Connecting for Life as a priority group. Using research conducted by online youth mental health service, ReachOut.com, which highlighted key areas of stress for young people the HSE identified 6 issues to include in the new campaign; Exams, Sleep, Digital devices and Bottling up your feelings, Relationships and Image. <br /><br />Imagery and messaging has been developed for 4 of the key areas and will be made available as poser packs to schools, youth and sports clubs around the country. The messaging has been developed to inform young people about the things they can do to reduce stress and anxiety. <br /><br />The campaign will be promoted on Radio, Social Media and through Digital ads targeting young people through relevant channels. We will be signposting to yourmenalhealth.ie for more information on the topics and will also promote the Childline text and phone option for any young person that might need immediate support. Content on all 6 issues, developed in partnership with SpunOut will also be hosted on ymh.ie.<br /><br />HSE/USI ReCharge Mental Health Campaign for 3rd Level Students:<br /><br />HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign is due to be launched on the 12th of November in University College Cork. The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie. USI is the national representative body for 374,000 students in 3rd level education and also receive funding from the HSE to provide training courses in SafeTALK, ASIST<br /><br />Mental Health First Aid<br /><br />Mental Health First Aid training for young people <br /><br />HSE Mental Health funds Mental Health First Aid to deliver courses to various target groups. Participants learn the signs and symptoms of mental health problems and what sort of help has been shown by research to be effective. The training has been shown to improve attitudes towards people with mental health difficulties, reduce stigma, improve knowledge, and improve people&rsquo;s confidence in providing help and likelihood to advise people to seek professional help. Over 2000 individuals and professionals have been trained in 2018 and the training will continue in 2019.<br /><br />Perinatal Training<br /><br />The HSEs Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services Model of Care was launched on 30.11.2017. Its implementation is now being directed and overseen by the Clinical Lead and Programme Manager. Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Teams are being recruited for the maternity hospital/service hub in each of the six Hospital Groups. Two of the teams are now operational. As part of this implementation a mental health midwife is also being recruited for each of the maternity hospitals/units with two for the four larger services, those with over 8,000 deliveries per year. Apart from the perinatal psychiatrists heading up each specialist hub team who are directly trained in the speciality, all other staff will require training in perinatal mental health. The National Implementation and Oversight Group is in the process of drafting a training document and in the meantime all newly recruited staff are being provided with the appropriate induction and training.</td></tr><tr><td>National Telephone Line <br /><br />3.1 - The Taskforce recommends increased investment in age-appropriate, scalable digital youth mental health supports in conjunction with existing providers to ensure all young people ages 0-25 have access to an active listening service and dynamic signposting tool.</td><td>HSE Mental Health has sought to advance the establishment and operation of a single and stand-alone National Mental Health Service Telephone Contact Facility to effectively manage mental health service related queries emerging from the community. This service will operate on a 24/7 basis and will encompass <br /><br />(i) the provision of information about, and direction of callers to, the most appropriate national and local pathway(s) to care specific to the query raised, and (ii) where possible the direct transfer of callers to the most appropriate existing helpline partners and/or services as required.<br /><br />Resource allocation has been agreed between HSE Mental Health and the National Ambulance Service (NAS) have recruited new NAS call takers. Training of call takers has commenced and will last for 14 weeks. An Expression of Interest is being sought for a suitably qualified mental health specialist to join the clinical hub of the NAS. At present, a go live date of Q3 2019 is envisioned.</td></tr><tr><td>E-Mental Health Strategy<br /><br />4.1 - Families, guardians and carers should be supported in parenting children and young people through the provision of universal, quality-assured and evidence-based parenting information and support programmes.<br /><br />4.2 - Evidence-based information, interventions and signposting tools about mental<br /><br />health should be included into routine perinatal care services.</td><td>The HSE launched &lsquo;yourmentalhealth.ie&rsquo; last year. This website provides advice, information and support services for mental health and wellbeing.<br /><br />Crisis textline<br /><br />The HSE is exploring how to best deliver an active listening service (Live Chat, Instant Messaging &amp;amp; SMS)<br /><br />HSE Mental Health has engaged with leading US-based provider of instant text messaging support services Crisis Text Line with a view to establishing their service in Ireland. The board of Crisis Text Line has approved the application to extend service licensing arrangements to Ireland. HSE is working in close collaboration with an existing service partner, SpunOut.ie/Community Creations, to act as the host/incubator organisation for the service on a pilot basis with contractual and service level arrangement negotiations now complete. The risk assessment of the service has been undertaken by SpunOut.ie/Community Creations. A project manager has been employed and the project plan is being developed and will be complete by mid-February 2019. <br /><br />Telepsychiatry Pilots<br /><br />Following a decision of the Project Steering Committee in January 2019, two telepsychiatry pilots are now being undertaken. These pilots encompass the following: <br /><br />(1) Remote consults to address CAMHS waiting lists.<br /><br />(2) Remote consults on national adolescent addiction and substance abuse service.<br /><br />It is also envisaged that a third pilot may be undertaken to assist reducing remote access and creating additional capacity and remote team consultations.</td></tr><tr><td>Schools And Youth Mental Health<br /><br />5.1 - The Department of Education and Skills should support teaching professionals in schools and centres for education with the knowledge and skills to understand their role in supporting young people with mental health issues and how to access information about services and supports available to them.<br /><br />5.2 - Principals and teachers should be supported to implement the wellbeing junior cycle curriculum.</td><td>The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023 was launched by the Minister for Education and Skills in July 2018.   The policy statement provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of wellbeing. It builds on the good work already happening in schools to ensure that best practice in whole-school wellbeing promotion is embedded across the system.  The policy outlines a multicomponent, whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.   This policy requires that a Wellbeing Promotion Process is developed and implemented, through the use of the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process, in all schools by 2023.  <br /><br />The policy includes a set of Statements of Effective Practice in relation to wellbeing promotion within the school system. The statements will support schools in reviewing their current provision in four key areas of wellbeing promotion, culture, curriculum, policy and partnership and in setting goals for improvement.  In order to support schools in the implementation of this Wellbeing Policy it is planned to develop and rollout a comprehensive programme of professional development, commencing in 2019.  This will include facilitating the engagement of schools in the school self-evaluation for wellbeing promotion process, which will build professional capacity in schools.  It also includes the provision of a comprehensive and easily-accessible set of resources to address school-identified wellbeing promotion needs.  The roll out will be aligned with the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme and the Schools for Health Programme delivered through the HSE, Health<br /><br />The Department of Education and Skills has introduced a new Wellbeing programme for schools which forms part of the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  It was introduced to first year students from September 2017.  Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and are available at . Schools will use the guidelines in formulating their individual Wellbeing programmes from September.  There will be 400 hours of timetabled engagement for the Wellbeing area of learning over the 3 years of Junior Cycle.</td></tr><tr><td>Third level supports<br /><br />6.1 - The current provision of counselling and mental health supports in higher level institutions should be maintained and enhanced<br /><br />6.2 - The Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills should develop appropriate indicators to assess student experience in higher education in the system performance framework for higher education<br /><br />6.3 - Prioritise the implementation of recommendations contained in &ldquo;Mental Health Matters&rdquo;</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Community Supports<br /><br />7.1 - The Task Force recommends that local government work with relevant agencies, youth groups and community groups to provide safe, &lsquo;youth friendly&rsquo; spaces, sporting and cultural facilities that are conducive to promoting good mental health. These should include the provision of pleasant spaces and facilities for young people to access qualified health and mental health care in the community.<br /><br />Evidence-based, quality-assured training in youth mental health should available to all individuals working with young people in the community</td><td>The provision of Youth Friendly Spaces in community settings is a high priority for local government. Working with youth groups and community groups, service providers have been asked to try to include youth friendly spaces so that mental health can be supported. The thrust of Government policy has been towards enhancing mental health support in the community since &lsquo;A Vision For Change&rsquo; was adopted in 2006. This policy will be continued when the refreshed policy is published later this year.</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility and Alignment<br /><br />8.1 - Pathfinder should carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in relation to youth mental health, in order to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater coordination<br /><br />8.2 - The HSE should improve provision of mental health supports to young people at the primary care level to reduce the pressure on the tertiary referral services and improve waiting times<br /><br />8.3 - The HSE should establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Lead for Youth Mental Health in each Community Health Organisation (CHO) to co-ordinate the provision of services and address gaps in service provision, including out of hours services. The CHO Leads will liaise with relevant agencies to develop appropriate communication protocols, standardised assessment processes and coordination of service provision. This joint working will bring together expert stakeholders to identify and address potential blocks to service provision and seek to reduce current wait times nationally with the introduction of other more appropriate interventions in primary care.</td><td>DCYA and the Department of Health established a Working Group in 2018 to scope connectivity in the area of youth mental health.   The group is made up of senior officials from both Departments with representatives from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and the Health Service Executive. <br /><br />The key objective of the working group is to examine psychological and mental health services for children and young people with the aim of agreeing a clearer continuum of provision and strengthening alignment between providers. <br /><br />Tusla and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration among the two organisations. Discussions are ongoing between the two organisations to ensure collaboration is effective and sustained. <br /><br />A key initiative that will inform the further advancement of the work of the group is the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project, and it is important that the Working Group align with this initiative. Centralising the work in this way will provide a clear overview of existing provision and proposed plans from across the relevant departments and agencies so as to identify gaps in provision, areas of alignment and areas for further development. <br /><br />Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define. At a recent meeting with HSE, Task Force representatives and NGO sector it was agreed to wait for the establishment of Pathfinder team to work on specific job specifications for the recommended posts.</td></tr><tr><td>Consent Issues<br /><br />9.1 - Legislation should be published to give effect to the recommendations of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act, 2001 with regard to children, including reforming the consent provisions, to allow young people under 18 direct access to mental health services</td><td>There are on-going discussions and legislative work in the Department of Health regarding amending the legislation to allow children under 16 access mental health services without the need to have parental consent. Draft Heads of Bill were sent to the Mental Health Commission for their input on 02/07/19.  It is expected that the Commission will need approximately six months to review the heads.</td></tr><tr><td>Improving Knowledge<br /><br />10.1 - A funded strategic national research programme on youth mental health will be developed<br /><br />10.2 - International sources of funding (for example from European Union or philanthropic organisations) should be leveraged to enhance this research strategy on youth mental health research</td><td>There have been discussion with the HRB on how best to approach these recommendations. There will be a need for new additional funding and this will need to be tied in the with the creation of the Pathfinder Team who will have responsibility to create structures for administering grants and creating criteria for issuing research funding. <br /><br />PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies) programme of research, funded by the HSE, is investigating how best to deliver mental health services and interventions to families where a parent has a diagnosed mental illness. Recent years have seen growing recognition of the importance of parental mental health and the need for more integrated and effective service responses to parents with mental illness and their children (Wilson et al., 2010; HSE, 2015). This research aims to:<br /><br />1. To identify mental health services in Ireland that currently deliver, or are interested in developing and delivering family-focused intervention(s) for families where a parent has a diagnosed mental health problem (and their children aged 0-18years). <br /><br />2. To subsequently investigate in more detail the implementation and effectiveness of selected interventions in order to inform a &lsquo;think family&rsquo; care delivery agenda in Ireland (and internationally).</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The HSE is currently running a number of pilot schemes within the fields of tele-counselling and tele-psychiatry. </p><p>The HSE, working in close collaboration with Turn2Me.org, is currently undertaking two six-month national pilot projects exploring the potential to develop the use of online tele-counselling.  All counselling sessions are conducted on a secure encrypted cloud-based platform, and can be conducted through video, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephone calls, or through instant text messaging.  </p><p>- Pilot 1 commenced in November 2018 and is being trialled with South Wicklow area-based service users. The pilot has progressed to the stage where GPs are issuing their patients with access details. </p><p>- Pilot 2 is currently in progress in the Galway/Mayo region (CHO2). In Galway, patients on the waiting list are being written to by CAMHS teams, to be offered the opportunity to avail of free online counselling. </p><p>Additionally, four tele-psychiatry pilots are now being undertaken by the HSE. These pilots are conducting remote psychiatric consultations to address a variety of different needs and demands. </p><p>- Pilot 1 will address the needs of people on CAMHS waiting lists in the Wexford/Waterford region (CHO 5).</p><p>- Pilot 2 will focus on the demand for specialist adolescent addiction and substance abuse service.</p><p>- Pilot 3 will address adult mental health service demands within the Galway/Mayo region (CHO 2).</p><p>- Pilot 4 will engage with the demand for services for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities in Kerry/Cork region (CHO 4). </p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied with the HSE's work in piloting different types of e-mental health treatments and can assure the Deputy of my own commitment to the further development of e-mental health initiatives.</p></reply>

It identified that there was a 30% reduction in mortality rates for AMIs over the past decade. It also showed that Ireland performs better than internationally reported averages in this area (OECD shows an age-sex standardised rate of 7.8 deaths per 100 admissions as compared to Ireland at 6.4 deaths per 100 admissions). The report also notes that there exists some variation in these rates between hospitals. </p>  <p>  The reporting of performance and outcome indicators is designed to enable the health service to improve the quality of care provided to patients.  Indicators are presented to allow for comparisons between regions, nationally, internationally and over time. When examining a data report, it is usual to see some variation between regions or between previous years.  While it is universally acknowledged that variation in data can sometimes be attributed to differences in recording practices, the use of different definitions or even chance, the data and variation is intended to be used by service providers and policy makers to inform our strategies to improve healthcare. </p>  <p>  The Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Clinical Programme of the Health Service Executive (HSE)  is a national clinical programme for acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction. The programme has over a number of years been involved in a major programme of work to save lives by identify variation and standardising care across the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in my Department in January 2018 and is ongoing and seeks to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive through establishing the requirements for an appropriate configuration of specialist cardiac services throughout Ireland.  It will be a comprehensive national plan based on a recognised methodological approach to service planning that is inclusive, consultative, robust and data driven.</p></reply>

These include:- the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Brexit-impacted SMEs and mid-cap businesses. The funding arrangements ensure that at least 40% of the fund is available to food businesses. Up to 14 June 2019, 585 applications have been approved.  The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 141, with a total value of &euro;30.6m, of which 29, with a value of &euro;8.2m, relate to food businesses;</p>  <p>- a market prioritisation exercise undertaken by Bord Bia to identify priority markets across all food and drinks categories; </p>  <p>- tailored supports and analysis are being provided to food companies through Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer;</p>  <p>- an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets;</p>  <p>- the recently launched DBEI/DAFM &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; will bring up to &euro;300 million of long-term strategic investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agrifood &amp;amp; seafood sectors.  The fund is leveraged by exchequer funding of &euro;62 million, of which 40%, or some &euro;25 million, has been provided by my Department.  Businesses have been able to apply for loan eligibility through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) since 17th April 2019. </p>  <p>I also have had ongoing discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit. The Commission have already made &euro;50m available to Irish beef farmers as a response to market pressures, and this can be matched by national funding. I expect to be rolling out a support scheme with this funding in the very near future.  I have also stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a further range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agrifood and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>And, of course, our practical preparations for all potential scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit, continue to be progressed and refined through the whole-of-Government coordination structures that have been in place for some time.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agrifood and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States were invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation (CMO) Management Committee, the Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and was not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content. The regulation was passed by the CMO committee last month and will now be enacted. Ireland must now notify the Commission, no later than 31 July 2019, of the measures to be taken in accordance with the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

The basic requirements for imports of meat are set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The third country of dispatch must be on an approved list for that product and the individual establishment from which the product is dispatched must also be on an approved list. These lists are published on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website. There is also a requirement that imports of meat are only allowed from countries with an approved residue monitoring plan.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Directorate General (DG) for Health and Food Safety (previously known as the Food and Veterinary Office or FVO) carries out assessments of third countries wishing to export these products to the EU and submits for Commission approval, those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the EU's Health and Food safety DG with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.  </p>  <p>  All products of animal origin for human consumption imported into the EU from third countries must be inspected at an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP). The range of checks to which products may be subjected include documentary, identity (traceability) and physical examinations to ensure that they comply with relevant EU and national legislation.  Imports must be accompanied by health certification provided by the competent authorities of the country of origin.  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1832 of 17 October 2016, relating to changes in health certification requirements came into effect from 31 March 2017 and applies to the import of horsemeat.  It imposes inter alia a minimum six-month residency requirement for the import into the EU of meat from horses from third countries. The non-EU country must also meet specified criteria with regard to the monitoring of administered substances and residues. The EU's Health and Food Safety DG also approves third-country meat processing establishments wishing to export to the EU and audits Member States&rsquo; import controls for products from third countries.</p>  <p>  When all import controls have been satisfied, compliant consignments may then be imported and placed on the single market,where they are subject to the EU&rsquo;s Food Hygiene Regulations in the same way as other compliant food products. </p></reply>

The derogation is an important facility for more than 7,000 farmers. Derogation farmers make up 6% of bovine farmers, 11% of the land area but have 20% of the bovine livestock herd. There has been a significant expansion in land area covered by the derogation of almost 35% since 2014.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 5,000 farmers with 13% of the national bovine herd, farm above the 170 kg livestock manure nitrogen/ha limit but export slurry to comply with the limit rather than applying for a derogation. </p>  <p>  Recent EPA reports have highlighted deterioration in water quality and increasing green house gas and ammonia emissions. There are also significant issues around the decline of EU protected habitats in Ireland. However, we know that there opportunities to reduce the impact of these farms on the environment.</p>  <p>  In light of the increasing land area being farmed under derogation and the environmental pressures outlined, it was considered prudent and important to the longer term retention of this important facility to review the conditions of the Nitrates derogation. Ireland's current derogation concludes in 2021, and failing to address the environmental pressures above, would negatively impact on any negotiations to renew this important facility. As part of this review, a public consultation was held and 75 submissions were received.</p>  <p>  The Nitrates expert group which is composed of officials from the EPA, Teagasc, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and my Department is currently considering these submissions. My colleague, Minister Murphy and I expect to receive the groups recommendations shortly. </p></reply>

The Teagasc MACC curve provides an identifiable suite of actions for delivery including measures on the use of lime, protected urea and slurry additives identified as having potential for GHG abatement.</p>  <p>  Protected urea or altered fertiliser formulation offers a very large abatement measure based on the replacement of Calcium Ammonium Nitrate fertiliser which would result in Nitrous Oxide emission reductions.</p>  <p>  The application of lime as a soil conditioner and specifically to neutralise soil acidity and raise pH to an agronomic optimum level has many benefits in terms of crop production and soil nutrient availability and has potential to reduce chemical nitrogen and increase nitrogen use efficiency. </p>  <p>  The acidification of manures and slurries using compounds such as alum, ferric chloride or polyaluminium chloride has been shown to sequester phosphorus, reduce ammonia emissions on landspreading and reduce methane and ammonia during storage.  These slurry additives showed potential to significantly reduce ammonia and methane emissions over the winter slurry storage period.</p>  <p>  The Teagasc MACC curve did not identify soil aeration as a measure with large carbon abatement potential and therefore is not included in the Climate Action Plan. However, we continue to keep potential opportunities under review and one of actions of the climate action plan is to further review and update the Teagasc MACC to reflect any advancements since its publication in 2018.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department supports research and innovation in these particular areas with ongoing research projects such as &ldquo;Mitigating Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Emissions by improved pH management of soils (MAGGE PH)&rdquo;, to ensure there is a continuous pipeline of new opportunities for GHG abatement to consider.</p>  <p>  My department will promote and encourage all actions that will assist in reaching our GHG targets by 2030. Forty percent of the future CAP (2021-2027) budget will be directed at climate and environmental measures. However, this will not be enough in itself and market based incentives and regulation will also be necessary.</p>  <p>  Ireland has an opportunity to become a global leader in actions on climate change.

However, the cost efficiency of this technology remains challenging, due to the low energy content and seasonality of farm manure.</p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) aims to bridge this economic gap and will support farms and businesses to adopt renewable heating systems, including biogas heating systems.  The SSRH has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by agricultural, commercial, industrial, district heating operators and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the rollout of the SSRH for the period up to 2027.</p><p>My colleague Richard Bruton, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment recently opened the second phase of the SSRH, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems for applications.

At a national level, the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan contains 14 actions relating to Irish agricultural adoption carbon abatement opportunities. There are a further 12 actions promoting diversification of land use (part of gradual transition), such as afforestation. Four additional actions look at the better management of Peatlands and soils. </p>  <p>  Our forest estate has a very important role to play in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Through the Effort Sharing Regulation (Regulation 2018/842), recognising that there is limited abatement potential in the agriculture sector, land use including forests and grasslands have the potential to contribute an additional 26.8 million tonnes of increased removals or emissions reduction over the period 2021-2030. The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan specifically associates the mobilisation of these CO2 removals as part of the contribution from agriculture and land use towards Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 targets. In addition, the current afforestation programme has been reviewed to enhance participation rates, while also informing land use policy to increase the benefits for climate, the environment, as well as rural communities.  Since the late 1980s, nearly &euro;3 billion has been invested in forestry, and ongoing suitable forest management will continue to contribute 21 MtCO2eq over the period 2021 to 2030.</p>  <p>  Research by Teagasc and the EPA has highlighted that grasslands play a key role in the provision and regulation of important ecosystem services. From a climate change perspective, grassland soils have the ability to sequester atmospheric CO2  , potentially contributing to climate change mitigation. Better management of grassland includes activities such as increased time to reseeding, increase in legumes, less frequent use of heavy machinery and long-term pasture management plans.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, hedgerows are estimated to cover 3.9% or 660,000 km of the Irish landscape. The recently published reports by The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action, as well as the All-of-Government Climate Action Plan to tackle climate breakdown both recognise the contribution of hedgerows to climate adaptation as well as to carbon sequestration and storage. </p>  <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has made and will continue to make an increasingly significant contribution to the environmental sustainability of the Irish agriculture. </p>  <p>  Forty percent of the future CAP (2021-2027) budget will be directed at climate and environmental measures which will likely include payments which promote biodiversity, water quality and carbon storage.</p></reply>

Farmers are required to adhere to best practice as set out by the Nitrates Regulation (SI 605/2016) and the Nitrates Explanatory Handbook for Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water Regulations 2018. The implementation of these are through the Nitrates Action Programme (NAP), and farmers are obliged to comply with the NAP with regard to spreading organic manure i.e. Slurry/Organic Manures can be a very cost effective resource to maintain and increase soil fertility levels. The department promote the use of organic manures as efficiently as possible to ensure maximum nutrient recovery.</p>  <p>  Innovation and the development of technology have further enhanced the use of organic manures within our systems of production. Low-emission slurry spreading (LESS) techniques has become increasingly popular.  LESS was included as a measure within the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) in 2015 and, as a measure for derogation farmers in 2017. It has received significant support under the Targetted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS). Over 2,000 farmers have been approved to purchase machinery.  In relation to payments, over 850 applicants have already been paid over &euro;10m under the Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme.  In addition, a further 495 young farmers have invested in this equipment bringing the total spend under TAMS II on Low Emission Slurry Spreading to date to &euro;15.2m. </p>  <p>  LESS can provide either through the use of a trailing shoe, dribble bar or injector system some significant benefits to the environment and improve the nutrient use efficiency of our organic manures. The benefits are as follows;</p>  <p>  - can reduce the ammonia emissions up to 97% of those emitted with a splash plate</p>  <p>  - LESS application process will increase the Nitrogen value by approximately three units per 1,000 gallons of slurry</p>  <p>  - Improved flexibility with application as a result of reduced contamination of herbage, leading to a quicker return to grazing.</p>  <p>  - The opportunity to apply slurry onto swards with larger grass covers.</p>  <p>  - The odours released during and after application are also usually reduced when using a trailing shoe or band spreader method compared with a splash plate.</p></reply>

For such cases, the penalty will be further reduced by 50%, subject to specific additional criteria. This provision applies to the Basic Payment Scheme, the Young Farmers Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme only. My Department implemented this provision in 2016 and, in the period 2016 to 2018, some 2,000 applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme benefitted from this provision. </p>  <p>  My Department also applies the provision under the regulations governing the Cross Compliance regime where a breach is deemed to be minor in nature and remedial action is taken within a specified period, no monetary sanction will apply.</p>  <p>  The second commitment relates to the holding of information meetings with farmers.  In 2018 and 2019 to date, my Department held a series (15) of information evenings, in collaboration with Teagasc, at various locations throughout the country. These meetings covered an overview of the inspection process and common reasons for penalties. Farmers were also afforded the opportunity to discuss their own individual issues with Department and Teagasc personnel on a one-to-one basis. Inspection staff also  attended a number of farmer meetings in collaboration with some of the farming organisation. Furthermore, information on the reasons for penalties was presented to farmers at the 2018 National Ploughing Championship.  It is intended to hold a further series of info meetings in late 2019/early 2020.</p></reply>

The Council facilitates the formation of collectives, whereby companies come together to form a group/collective to pool resources and lower market development costs.  The council provides a forum for the members to promote the Irish shellfish producing industry and to address common export opportunities and challenges in the Chinese market, which can be of mutual benefit to all the members operating in the Chinese market.</p>  <p>  BIM, as the facilitator of the Council, has undertaken a number of EMFF-funded projects to support the work of the Council.  For example, projects have been undertaken to evaluate the supply chain and understand the market opportunities for Irish Shellfish in the tier one cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen and a market analysis and culinary profile was undertaken for brown crab in tier one cities to establish a premium position for live and frozen brown crab.</p>  <p>  At this time, BIM has not submitted any request to my Department for 2019 EMFF funding of any project connected to the China Council.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 prioritises the potential for growth in new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  In May, during the China Trade mission, I met with the Vice Minister of General Administration of Customs in China (GACC) and his officials. Sheepmeat access was a key topic discussed at this meeting.  I received confirmation that GACC is processing Ireland's sheepmeat application and a commitment that officials from GACC will visit Ireland on a sheepmeat audit.</p>  <p>  In June, on the Japanese trade mission, I met both my counterpart, the Japanese Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF),  and with the Vice Minister for Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).  These Ministerial meetings followed detailed technical meetings involving senior officials from both Ministries.  At the conclusion of these meetings, I was delighted to announce that we had reached agreement in principle on market access for Irish sheepmeat.  Details will be finalised by an exchange of letters between my Department and the relevant Japanese officials</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that  sheep farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

The Terms of Reference for the Forum outlined that its deliberations should be in line with the principles from the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy:</p>  <p>  - Working in Partnership;</p>  <p>  - Acknowledging Roles and Responsibilities;</p>  <p>  - Prevention is Better than Cure; and</p>  <p>  - Reflecting Costs and Benefits </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the total annual net cost of the TB Programme is over &euro;90 million a year of which &euro;45 million is provided by the Exchequer, &euro;35 million from farmers and &euro;10 million from the EU. EU co-funding for the TB Programme peaked at &euro;12.7 million in 2014 but has been falling steadily since then. The EU has capped its contribution at &euro;8.3 million for 2019 marking a 35% reduction in 5 years. All indications suggest further significant cuts are likely requiring this shortfall in funding to be met by the State and farmers. With this is mind and reflecting the Costs and Benefits principle from the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy, I understand the Forum is proposing an independent review into the Costs and Benefits of the TB Programme to inform its future financing.</p>  <p>  It is important to note the existing levels of support provided to Irish farmers when they experience a TB restriction. For every reactor (animal identified as infected with TB) taken from a farm, the herdowner is compensated for the open market value of that animal as if it was otherwise healthy. This is referred to as the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme.  The cost of this Scheme increased from &euro;10.5 million in 2017 to &euro;14.3 million (+36%) in 2018. Separately, Ireland operates a number of supplementary compensation schemes which are not replicated in other countries that have a bovine TB Programme. These schemes (Hardship Grant, Income Supplement and Depopulation Grant) are designed to assist farmers with additional costs and consequential losses associated with a TB restriction. Following increases in rates and changes to eligibility for these schemes in 2015, the cost of these schemes has increased by &euro;1.7 million (80%) relative to 2015 when disease metrics have remained broadly stable over that period. </p>  <p>  Currently, approximately 4,000 farm families per annum suffer the hardship and stress associated with a TB outbreak and associated restrictions. Trends to date in 2019 suggest a similar number of farm families will be afflicted with a TB breakdown this year, marking the fifth consecutive year of stagnation in TB herd incidence.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, eradicating the disease as quickly as possible will result in significant savings for all affected stakeholders and a reduction in associated stress for herdowners. As outlined above, the direct savings to farmers if the disease were eliminated is estimated at approximately &euro;35 million per annum, and that is before any market or other impacts are factored in.  I am committed to supporting measures which can support this objective.</p>  <p>  I understand that the TB Stakeholder Forum's most recent meeting was on June 25th and I expect that the Chairman will send me an Interim Report shortly.

The original proposals from the EU Commission were quite severe and would have had a significant negative impact on Irish farmers. The original draft proposals included:</p><p>- 12 month minimum TB restriction period</p><p>- Prohibition on any inward/outward movement in restricted herds</p><p>- Derestriction only to occur following two clear tests 6 months apart</p><p>- Compulsory 30-day pre/post movement test in all cases</p><p>Over the past year, my officials have engaged intensively with Commission counterparts and experts from other Member States on this issue.  Ireland was successful in achieving considerable changes to the draft TB regulations to the benefit of Irish farmers in negotiations on all points but one. </p><p>The current draft text retains the 30 day pre/post movement test requirement unless the herd and animal have been tested in the last 6 months.  My officials proposed the introduction of risk-based pre/post movement testing, supported by peer-reviewed scientific research undertaken in Ireland. Our analysis shows that this approach would be more effective than across-the-board pre/post movement testing. Ireland has approximately 2.2 million movements (counting farm-to-farm and farm-to-mart-to-farm each as one movement for these purposes) per year. The new rule would mean that these would have to either take place within six months of the herd test, or the herdowner (buyer or seller) would have to have a pre/post movement test carried out.</p><p>However, there has been very limited support from other Member States for this position. </p><p>My officials have engaged with farm organisations in respect of the new EU Animal Health Law and are happy to consult further on this issue.</p></reply>

In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners. The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.  It is an industry that is ingrained in the social and cultural networks of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Greyhound Sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times and the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed by the President on 28 May 2019. This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. To this end, I welcome the fact that Bord na gCon will continue to invest significant resources into regulation and greyhound welfare and intends to devote more resources to welfare, re-homing and traceability.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the recent RTE Programme has undermined the public's confidence in the sector and Bord na gCon is committed to strengthening its role in the areas of traceability, welfare and enforcement.  I am very concerned that steps must immediately be taken to address the issues raised in the programme. However, the suspension of funds would have immediate consequences for employment in the sector and could have unintended consequences for the welfare of dogs used for racing and coursing.</p></reply>

The Centre has a number of roles, and is responsible for acting as a conduit for information to constituents, including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, Government Departments and Agencies. The Centre also provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and is involved in coordinating the response to significant incidents. The Centre also acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State, and has a number of formal roles in the protection of Critical National Infrastructure, including those under the EU Network and Information Security Directive.</p>  <p>  The NCSC is composed of highly skilled, specialist technical civilian staff, with skillsets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cyber security compliance, as well as general cyber security skills. In terms of resources, additional funding has been secured for a substantial enlargement of the NCSC both in terms of personnel and additional technology in order to address the responsibilities placed upon the State by the Network and Information Security Directive which was transposed last year. The annual allocation of the National Cyber Security Centre in 2019 is now &euro;4,000,000, and staffing levels have increased significantly in recent years. My Department is also finalising a new National Cyber Security Strategy, which will set out the measures that Government will take to meet future challenges in cyber security, both in terms of Government and critical national infrastructure.</p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.     The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 75% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high-speed broadband in South Kildare has increased by 5,665, a 22% increase. There are approximately 39,140 premises in total in South Kildare, of which 31,103 (79%) have access to high speed broadband. A further 307 premises (1%) will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. </p>  <p>  The remaining 7,730 (20%) homes, schools, farms and businesses in South Kildare will receive access to a high speed broadband service under the Government&rsquo;s State intervention under the NBP.</p>  <p>  This intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. Following rigorous evaluation by my Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May.  </p>  <p>  The Government decision on 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p>  <p>  In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties.  It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. In June 2018 the range of energy efficiency measures available under the BEWH Scheme was expanded to include &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures. Under the expanded scheme, in certain circumstances, external or internal wall insulation, central heating and replacement windows, can be provided where a technical assessment (by SEAI contractors) considers them necessary. These additional measures brought the level of retrofit into alignment with that envisaged by the National Development Plan, but changed the relative attractiveness of availing of other 'shallower' interventions. Managing the enhanced package of measures has required careful monitoring and programme management by SEAI within available resources and I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the SEAI will be in communication with the CBOs and contractors in relation to further allocations in the coming days  <i>.</i></p><p>The BEWH Scheme is delivered through a panel of contractors, appointed through a competitive tendering process. Since the introduction of &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures some CBO&rsquo;s that are only contracted to carry out &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; measures under the BEWH Scheme, have seen their allocation volumes reduce. While the expansion of the scheme has been positive for the energy poor homeowners involved and for building capacity in the supply chain in general, it has had some negative impacts for contractors that are unable to deliver deeper works. </p><p>SEAI will be renewing its contract with BEWH contractors in 2020, which will require all contractors to be able to deliver all measures, deeper and shallow. SEAI is encouraging all CBOs to apply for this contract and has been working with CBOs over the past year supporting them in upskilling and gaining experience to help ensure they can compete for the 2020 contract and that their organisations remain viable. </p><p>Building capacity in the sector is a top priority. However it is critical that we build capacity sustainably, ensuring that all contractors delivering these ever increasingly complex retrofit projects are adequately skilled and resourced. The new Climate Action Plan includes a number of measures which will build the supply chain for energy efficiency retrofits required to meet our 2030 targets including support for the development of necessary skills across the education and training system.</p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have a great window of opportunity to reverse the current trend in emissions and secure a healthy more resilient future for the country. It means changing the way we heat our homes, the way we travel and the way we power the country.   The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. </p>  <p>  A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.</p>  <p>  In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:</p>  <p>  - public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040 </p>  <p>  - measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices </p>  <p>  - new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities) </p>  <p>-   actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions</p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, a system of carbon budgets is being developed. This will have a significant impact on the way in which the system of government works, with each relevant Minister being responsible for carbon emissions for their sector. Each Department will not just be required to stay within their fiscal budget, but also to stay within their carbon budget, which will be the total amount of emissions which their sector will be permitted to produce in a particular period. This new system of carbon budgets will be introduced into law by a new Climate Action (Amendment) Bill. </p>  <p>  Each Government Department will have to determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The cost of delivering each target will depend on the mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector. The Climate Action Plan will be updated annually, which will allow us to take into account changing technologies and changing costs as we seek to meet 2030 and 2050 climate targets. </p>  <p>  Public funding will be required to deliver some of the actions which have been set out. However, the plan proposes to introduce reforms so we maximise the impact of the funding which is available. This is particularly so in the case of retrofitting. The Plan identifies a range of measures that will be needed to deliver the retrofit target. A central commitment in that regard is the development of a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods. The savings on electricity bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer and produce lower levels of emissions. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there would also be a very significant cost to the Exchequer for not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would also lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run.</p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.  </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  With reference to the Deputy's question on Cavan and Monaghan, there are approximately 42,143 premises in County Cavan. Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Cavan has increased by 6,557, a 16% increase. In total, the number of premises in Cavan with access to high speed broadband is now 24,777, or 59% of the total premises in the county. Approximately another 344 premises will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 33,073 premises in County Monaghan.  Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Monaghan increased by 2,748, a 6% increase.  In total, the number of premises in Monaghan with access to high speed broadband is now 16,803, or 51% of the total premises in the county.  Approximately another 512 premises will be served by eir under that company's ongoing rural deployment.</p>  <p>  The remaining 17,022 premises in Cavan and 15,758 premises in Monaghan will be connected under the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan State led intervention. </p>  <p>  I recently brought a recommendation to the Government to confer preferred bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP State intervention procurement process, and the Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. A period of final due diligence on all elements of the contract is part of the normal conclusion of a procurement process.</p>  <p>  National Broadband Ireland will be supported by a number of experienced subcontractors and is currently tasked with finalising negotiations on contracts with approximately 40 subcontractors to assist in the delivery of the NBP. It is anticipated that a subset of approximately 15 to 20 of these subcontracts will be required prior to contract close to support deployment. The state aid notification relating to the NBP will also be submitted to the European Commission.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated these elements will require a number of months, with contract close expected later this year and deployment commencing shortly after that.</p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p>  <p>  In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties.  It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county.

I propose to take Questions Nos. 771  and 772 together.</p>  <p>  The EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications allows for the application of a Universal Service Obligation (USO) in respect of fixed voice services. The existing framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second). There is no provision in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services. </p>  <p>  The Directive Establishing a European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972), which will come into force following transposition in late 2020, aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks, and contains a provision that would allow Member States to apply a USO for adequate speed broadband, in specific circumstances, where such networks are available.</p>  <p>  Mobile operators are, however, rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the EU Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of the 694-790MHz (700MHz) spectrum band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas. The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.  An EU level Decision has been adopted in order to co-ordinate release of the band in all Member States by 30 June 2020. This proposal will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band, which will provide enhanced mobile services.  My Department and ComReg have been working to ensure the necessary measures are taken to facilitate a clearance of the spectrum to meet the 2020 timeline for clearing broadcasting services from the band. In addition, ComReg published a preliminary consultation in June 2018 on a proposed award of spectrum rights of use covering multi- band spectrum, to include the 700 MHz band. On 18 June 2019, ComReg issued a response to consultation and further consultation on the proposed multi-band and spectrum award for the 700 MHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.3 GHz and 2.6 GHz bands.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing efforts to improve mobile telephony coverage nationally, the Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p>  <p>Now in its third year of operation, the Taskforce has addressed over 60 actions and continues to focus on issues that are negatively impacting upon the rollout of essential telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas. The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review Report, which was published on 21   February 2019 together with the 2019 Work Programme. Over 30 new actions are contained in the 2019 Work Programme for delivery this year.</p>  <p>  Various measures are underway under the aegis of the Taskforce which will address mobile coverage deficits, particularly in rural areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan. </p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  - ComReg has published a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in areas currently experiencing a low level of service, including counties Cavan and Monaghan. </p></reply>

Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers.  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 78 fast chargers as a part of the ESB eCars network. A real-time map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB's website at <i><i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i></i>. Currently, there are 10 standard AC charge points (5 chargers) and one fast charger in Monaghan and 10 standard AC charge points (5 chargers) in County Cavan as part of the ESB eCars network. </p><p>Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project successfully completed the assessment stage and the validation stage is now underway. The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. </p><p>The locations of the chargers have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. ESB eCars is currently identifying the most appropriate locations for the chargers to be sited. The sites will be identified using the latest software mapping techniques, taking account of information on current charge point usage, traffic volume, accessibility, amenities and grid capacity at the sites. </p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is also working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-11a.2166.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071100088#WRGG05000"><p>I am advised that the Community Based Organisation (CBO) referred to by the Deputy is contracted by the SEAI to deliver works under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  This Scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades to the homes of people living in or at risk of energy poverty.  In June 2018 the range of energy efficiency measures available under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme was expanded to include &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures.  Under the expanded scheme, in certain circumstances, external or internal wall insulation, central heating and replacement windows, can be provided where a technical assessment (by SEAI contractors) considers them necessary. These additional measures brought the level of retrofit into alignment with that envisaged by the National Development Plan, but changed the relative attractiveness of availing of other 'shallower' interventions. Managing the enhanced package of measures has required careful monitoring and programme management by SEAI within available resources and I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the SEAI will be in communication with the CBOs and contractors in relation to further allocations in the coming days  <i>.</i></p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme is delivered through a panel of contractors, appointed through a competitive tendering process. Since the introduction of &lsquo;deeper&rsquo; measures some CBO&rsquo;s that are only contracted to carry out &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; measures under the Scheme, have seen their allocation volumes reduce. While the expansion of the scheme has been positive for the energy poor homeowners involved and for building capacity in the supply chain in general, it has had some negative impacts for contractors that are unable to deliver deeper works.  </p><p>SEAI will be renewing its contract with Better Energy Warmer Homes contractors in 2020, which will require all contractors to be able to deliver all measures, deeper and shallow. SEAI is encouraging all CBOs, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy, to apply for this contract and has been working with CBOs over the past year supporting them in upskilling and gaining experience to help ensure they can compete for the 2020 contract and that their organisations remain viable.  </p><p>Building capacity in the sector is a top priority. However it is critical that we build capacity sustainably, ensuring that all contractors delivering these ever-increasingly complex retrofit projects are adequately skilled and resourced.  The new Climate Action Plan includes a number of measures which will build the supply chain for energy efficiency retrofits required to meet our 2030 targets including support for the development of necessary skills across the education and training system.</p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. </p>  <p>  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced in May.</p>  <p>  Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works.  </p>  <p>  For the first time applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced. </p>  <p>  As soon as allocations have been made, my Department will carry out a review of all aspects of the 2018 round of the programme to include any possible improvements for the future. This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round but I fully expect that the SCP will again be open for new applications before the end of this year</p></reply>

In 2010 the Department conducted a review of the Disabled Parking Scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders and one of the issues examined was eligibility for the scheme.  As a result of the review the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness.  This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme to include people with invisible disabilities such as autism has been raised on a number of occasions and the Department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWC), on this matter.  In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the recent changes made to the disabled parking scheme in the United Kingdom. I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy however that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general. </p></reply>

The <i>Plan</i>clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. As the transport sector accounts for a little over one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s non-ETS emissions there is no question that it must feature strongly in the national decarbonisation effort. </p><p>Cutting congestion is an action which would contribute positively to the decarbonisation effort. Congestion also imposes significant costs on residents, commuters and businesses in urban areas.  My Department is already seeking to address congestion and its negative impacts by encouraging modal shift away from private passenger cars towards public and active travel. To this end, a significant investment of &euro;8.6 billion is being made to increase the capacity and attractiveness of sustainable mobility under the National Development Plan 2018-27 as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>.  </p><p>The potential roles of congestion pricing, low-emission zones and demand management were considered during the development of the <i>Climate Action Plan </i>and consequently, Action 81 calls for the development of a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking pricing policies, the granting of local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero-emission vehicles only, and the examination of the role of demand management measures in Irish cities, including low emission zones and parking pricing policies. My Department has lead responsibility for the implementation of this action.  Later this year, and in collaboration with the local authorities and the NTA, we will commission a study to:</p><p>- Consider key management drivers in an Irish context (e.g. congestion, air quality, climate considerations);</p><p>- Review international best practices on measures such as urban congestion charging, low emission zones and parking pricing policies; and</p><p>- Recommend the most appropriate responses for Dublin/Cork/Galway/Limerick taking into account overall transport strategies in each case.</p><p>Stakeholder consultation will need to be undertaken as part of this Demand Management study. Implementation of required and most appropriate measures in each case will have regard to existing powers of local authorities, including those reserved to elected members. I will work closely with Minister Murphy and his Department if additional legislation or local authority functions are identified as providing pathways for addressing these problems.</p></reply>

As it is a matter for each local authority to determine if, and where, such restrictions should apply within its own functional area, I as Minister currently have no direct role in restricting vehicular access to individual roads.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, however, action 81 of the Climate Action Plan calls for the relevant bodies to "develop a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking policies, and provide local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or town to zero emission vehicles only". In light of this,  my Department will commission a demand management study later this year in order to consider the potential role of demand management measures in Irish cities which can be deployed to address economic congestion, air quality concerns and to reduce climate harmful emissions. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the most appropriate measure, or measures, in each case will have regard to existing powers of local authorities, including those reserved to elected members, and my Department will work with Minister Murphy&rsquo;s Department if additional legislation or functions are necessary.</p></reply>

My Department has been consulting extensively with the Maritime sector, including shipping, port and other key maritime stakeholders, regarding Brexit issues on an ongoing basis.  These consultations have included a Transport and Logistics All Island Sectorial meeting in Dundalk in January 2017, three Brexit Maritime Transport Workshops / Seminars (in April 2017, March 2018, and January 2019) with a further Maritime Transport Workshop / Seminar planned for September 2019.  </p>  <p>  Eight meetings have been held specifically with shipping companies and shipping interests in January and February 2019 alone, and these discussions with shipping companies have been continued by my Department since then as well by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) who report to my Department.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 IMDO report on the Implications Of Brexit On The Use Of The Landbridge acknowledges that &ldquo;for Ireland, maritime links represent a key means of ensuring its direct connectivity with mainland Europe, particularly in view of the uncertain evolution of trade flows passing over the United Kingdom 'land bridge'.  The viability of the ongoing use of the landbridge route to access the single market in a no deal Brexit scenario is a serious concern for Irish importers and exporters and the impact of any disruption to the landbridge cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, particularly in a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  The assessment of my Department and the IMDO, based on extensive and ongoing consultations with the shipping sector, is that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, the shipping sector can respond quickly to meet such demands.       </p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, there has already been a significant market response evidencing the capacity of market participants to respond to shifts in trade patterns resulting from Brexit. In 2018, CLdN launched MV Celine, the World&rsquo;s largest RoRo vessel, and in 2019 launched the MV Laureline RoRo vessel, significantly increasing capacity on the Dublin&ndash;Rotterdam and Zeebrugge routes.  </p>  <p>  Irish Ferries' investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, MV W.B. Yeats, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing or 60,600 HGVs per annum. This additional capacity alone will be sufficient to cater for a substantial switch of UK landbridge traffic to direct links to EU ports, should such a demand arise. Also, in May 2018, Brittany Ferries' launched a direct route from Cork to Santander in northern Spain, and a vessel of similar size to the W.B. Yeats is due to be delivered on the Irish Sea routes in 2020.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as announced this week, BG Freight Line is commencing a direct Waterford-Rotterdam weekly LoLo freight service, which will act as a deep-sea feeder through Rotterdam port and onwards to worldwide destinations for Irish importers and exporters.</p>  <p>  If disruption is to arise, it would likely be most acute in the immediate period following a no-deal Brexit as a result of a short time lag between an increase in demand for direct connectivity to the Continent and a market response, as shipping companies assess the actual difficulties and implement a response. The clear view of my Department and the IMDO is that the optimal solution in response to increased demand for extra capacity to continental Europe in a &lsquo;No-Deal&rsquo; Brexit scenario is for industry to respond to market changes in a timely manner.  </p>  <p>  Overall, this has been happening to date as I have set out above.  A number of actions are being implemented by my Department and the IMDO to encourage this responsiveness.  These will include a focussed awareness campaign by early September aimed at shipping companies, importers and exporters to create a dialogue between them to identify any new market demands as early as possible.</p></reply>

The readiness of the haulage sector, the introduction of additional customs controls and SPS checks East/West, and the temporary EU contingency Regulation aimed at ensuring basic road freight connectivity between the EU and UK were discussed. </p><p>My Department hosted a Brexit Freight Forum with key road transport and maritime stakeholders including haulage industry representative bodies on 21 January 2019. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were also in attendance and addressed the Forum. My Department also previously held a similar Brexit Freight Forum in March 2018.</p><p>In February and also in March, my Department was represented at the Irish Retail Grocery and Distribution Sector Roundtable hosted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and engagement with this sector, including haulage industry representatives, is continuing.  </p><p>In March, my Department issued a comprehensive Brexit Communications Notice to all licensed international road haulage operators outlining the position on a range of transport issues which would arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This notice is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and the information available online will continue to be updated to keep industry stakeholders informed of Brexit developments. </p><p>A very important development to note is that the EU has adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2019, which will ensure the maintenance of basic road connectivity for road freight transport in the event of a no deal Brexit. This temporary measure, effective until 31 December 2019, allows UK hauliers to continue to access the EU on the basis that the UK gives reciprocal access to EU companies and operators. This Regulation is currently due to expire on 31 December and over the coming months, Ireland and other EU Member States will engage further with the Commission on this measure.</p><p>The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) study into the implications of Brexit on the use of the landbridge, published in November 2018, estimated that approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) travel between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge each year. This would equate to a weekly average of approximately 2,880 HGVs moving between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge, although there can be peak times within each week, and also on a seasonal basis. A cross-departmental Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was established in October 2017 and has been working on measures aimed at ensuring the ongoing effective and efficient use of the landbridge post-Brexit, including the key Dover-Calais route. My Department is represented on this Group and engagement with our EU partners to find solutions to minimise the potential disruption to Irish hauliers&rsquo; access to and through the UK in the event of a no deal Brexit continues.</p><p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, along with other Government Departments, has emphasised the importance of stakeholders taking all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. I would encourage road haulage operators to refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of road transport, the EU&rsquo;s basic road connectivity contingency Regulation, the Brexit section on my Department&rsquo;s website and <i>gov.ie/Brexit</i>.</p></reply>

There is no centralised records system for the fourteen specified institutions but the Deputy may wish to note that certain records from several of these former institutions are now in the possession of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  Tusla has made these records available to the independent statutory Commission of Investigation on Mother and Baby Homes. The Commission has reported that when its cross-referencing of all records is complete it should provide as comprehensive an account as is possible of the pathways of entry into and exit from these institutions of the children concerned. It is reasonable to assume that this analysis will assist to estimate the numbers of children born or resident for a time in these institutions. The Commission is due to report in February 2020.</p>  <p>  All birth records are held by the General Register Office (GRO). Information provided by the GRO on births recorded at the addresses of the main mother and baby institutions was published in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes in July 2014. This data, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, identifies a total of over 23,000 births as having taken place at the addresses of 9 of these institutions. The delivery of babies to unmarried mothers on-site was a feature of many, though not all, Mother and Baby Homes so this figure would not represent the full numbers of births to mothers resident in these homes. Practices changed over the period during which these the institutions were in operation with births increasingly taking place in maternity hospitals or maternity units in later years.</p></reply>

One of the strands was the appointment of Childminding Advisory Officers, some of whom were employed by the HSE and some by City and County Childcare Committees. Their roles included offering information, support and training to childminders; maintaining the voluntary notification system; and administering other supports for childminders. The Childminding Advisory Officer posts were largely discontinued in 2012-2013 in the context of widespread budget cuts. One Childminding Advisory Officer post remains in place in a County Childcare Committee. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the reduced resources, the City/County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Organisations, funded by my Department, have continued to play a significant role in supporting childminders as well as centre-based early learning and care and school age childcare services. Many of the actions have continued, including the continuation of the Childminding Development Grant scheme on an annual basis, through the work of other staff within City/County Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  My Department recently appointed a National Childminding Coordinator, who will support the implementation of the forthcoming Childminding Action Plan at national level, and who will also oversee the work of a new team of 6 regional Childminding Development Officers, for which funding was secured in Budget 2019. </p>  <p>  The new Childminding Development Officer posts will be full-time posts, located within City and County Childcare Committees, with each regional officer supporting a cluster of City and County Childcare Committees to work with and support childminders. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently working closely with City and County Childcare Committees to ensure the recruitment this summer of the new regional posts. Their immediate task will be to work with all the City and County Childcare Committees to maximise the number of childminders who can register with Tusla within the current regulatory framework and take part in the National Childcare Scheme. They will also play an important role in working with the City and County Childcare Committees to assist in the registration and support of a much wider cohort of childminders through the Childminding Action Plan.</p></reply>

Similarly, individuals who give evidence at a full Commission hearing may read the transcript of their evidence on the Commission&rsquo;s premises.  If individuals provide personal records to the Commission, it is the Commission's policy to photocopy these and return the originals to the people concerned on the day. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework requires that evidence is generally given in private to facilitate fact finding while also protecting the rights of all individuals and bodies to fair procedure. The Commission has discretion to hear all or part of the evidence of a witness in public if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of both the investigation and fair procedures to do so, or where the Commission agrees to the request of a witness to provide all or part of his or her evidence in public. Compliance with these requirements prohibits the Commission from providing written transcripts directly to witnesses in the course of its investigations. </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to provide testimony on such personal experiences, and the crucial importance of this information in informing the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p></reply>

Contact details for all of the CCCs, in addition to other information about the services they provide, may be found on www.myccc.ie </p><p>Each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including the monitoring of capacity. The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November and relates to the 2017/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision nationally meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this. </p><p>Pobal reports that nationally the trend suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos. Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list.  The following table is the latest information available taken from the Pobal report.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Enrolled</th><th>Waiting list</th><th>Vacant places</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2,057</td><td>260</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>3,120</td><td>249</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>4,280</td><td>192</td><td>383</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>4,246</td><td>510</td><td>295</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>14,662</td><td>869</td><td>1,032</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>6,575</td><td>477</td><td>882</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Dublin City</td><td>16,075</td><td>3,492</td><td>581</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>6,357</td><td>880</td><td>224</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Fingal</td><td>11,149</td><td>1,076</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; South Dublin</td><td>9,294</td><td>639</td><td>373</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>10,514</td><td>571</td><td>620</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>5,625</td><td>269</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>8,045</td><td>350</td><td>304</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>3,944</td><td>414</td><td>195</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>3,695</td><td>43</td><td>298</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1,437</td><td>63</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>7,805</td><td>865</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1,685</td><td>168</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>4,297</td><td>238</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>4,509</td><td>421</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>6,996</td><td>396</td><td>355</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>3,623</td><td>147</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2,697</td><td>123</td><td>225</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2,311</td><td>172</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>3,144</td><td>185</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>6,662</td><td>372</td><td>437</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>4,612</td><td>274</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>3,781</td><td>316</td><td>385</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>5,724</td><td>296</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>4,276</td><td>231</td><td>224</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>173,197</td><td>14,558</td><td>9,420</td></tr></table></p><p>Further, I secured &euro;8.86m in capital funding for childcare in 2019 with the ultimate aim of benefitting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure and capacity. A particular focus will be to expand service provision for children under three years of age.  </p><p>Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities. I am delighted that &euro;250 million in additional funding has been committed to for the expansion of high quality, early learning and care and school age childcare over the duration of the Plan.</p></reply>

One of these objectives is to identify community childcare groups that are experiencing or are at risk of experiencing sustainability challenges, and to intervene and provide support where this is required. </p><p>CCCs currently provide a number of sustainability supports to community childcare services, which are delivered in partnership with Pobal's Case Management team, under the direction of my Department. This can include the provision of expert guidance, identifying a service to Pobal where there is a requirement for targeted sustainability funding, and also assisting a service to review and reconfigure its operational or business model. </p><p>My Department has collaborated with CCCs in developing a suite of sustainability tools to assist this form of operational review, and has recently engaged in a nation-wide programme to train CCCs in their use. My Department also funded the distribution of the <i>Managing Better</i>series  to community childcare services in early 2019. These booklets provide early learning and care and school age childcare services with valuable guidance in the areas of Good Governance, Financial Management, and HR.</p><p>Demand for early learning and care and school age childcare services continues to grow, with fewer vacancies across the system. This growing demand, together with the 117% increase in investment in the last 4 years, and the forthcoming introduction of the National Childcare Scheme, should enable services operate in a viable and sustainable manner once their business model is responsive to local need.</p></reply>

They were designed to provide support for schools in their work with students and their families to ensure that schools can maintain the best possible educational environment. The Guidelines were prepared with the help of an Expert Group, and wide-ranging inputs from management bodies, teacher unions, parent organisations, students, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Science (DES) and its agencies and services, non-governmental organisations, State agencies and many other contributors. </p><p>The existing guidelines state that &ldquo;Exclusion of a student for part of the school day, as a sanction, or asking parents to keep a child from school, as a sanction, is a suspension. Any exclusion imposed by a school is a suspension, and should follow the guidelines relating to a suspension&rdquo;.  The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires that when a student is suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than 6 days the school must inform an Educational Welfare Officer. </p><p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services (EWS) participated in the recent Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills examination of the matter of the use of reduced timetables in schools. My Department and the EWS are working closely with the Department of Education and Skills who have a lead role on this issue. It is important, however, to note that there are instances where, if agreed by all parties (the parents, child and the school) the use of a &ldquo;reduced timetable&rdquo; may, in certain exceptional circumstances, be deemed an appropriate short-term response to support a student&rsquo;s continuation in education. In such instances it would be important that a record is maintained detailing such an agreed arrangement.  </p><p>The issue of reduced timetables was the subject of a recent meeting of our National Advisory Council for Children and Young People wherein the range of issues, whereby these are used as sanctions, but in some cases supports, was considered. The National Advisory Council will continue to consider this issue and I intend to ensure that the perspectives of these experts would inform enhanced guidance which will be developed collaboratively by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla Educational Welfare Services.</p></reply>

Funding is approved to services, for the full programme year based on the level of service provision as submitted through the child registrations and the final 'CCS band approval'.  Funding is committed to the services for the full programme year on the basis that if a child leaves the services before the planned childcare end date, the service can retain the funding but should make all efforts to provide the CCS funding subsidy to another child who may not have been registered in the services over the snapshot period but who may otherwise have been eligible for CCS funding.  Funding is approved for the full programme year to allow the service the ability to determine their annual budgets for the year and manage on this basis.  </p><p>However, the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) scheme which was introduced in 2016, and is not based on a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; period.  It allows for greater flexibility with start dates and a child can be registered at anytime during the 52 week programme year. Community services can be in contract for both CCS and CCSP.</p><p>To assist with the transition to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) the CCS programme will be streamlined for this coming 2019/20 programme year.  The CCS Scheme will be merged with the CCSP scheme once the current programme year comes to an end in August 2019. All CCS eligible children must be registered on CCSP for the new programme year 2019/20. As CCSP has identical eligibility criteria, levels of service and band rates to CCS, this will have no impact on the levels of funding to parents<b>.</b></p></reply>

However, my Department is responsible for the administration and implementation of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, one of four funds established under Project Ireland 2040.  </p>  <p>  The Fund seeks to support ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities. The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over 10 years to the Fund and &euro;315 million is allocated to the Fund for the period 2019-2022.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that as part of Project Ireland 2040, it is intended that the broad range of other initiatives delivered by my Department in order to support rural regeneration and economic growth, such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rdRiachtanais (CL&Aacute;R) and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, will in the future be integrated into the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and under the larger Project Ireland 2040 umbrella to ensure more strategic use of this funding.</p>  <p>  In terms of the implementation of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, applications for the first call under the Fund, which is competitive in nature, closed in September 2018.  Following the conclusion of the first call in February 2019, a total of 84 successful projects had been announced, with funding of &euro;86m provided from the Fund.  This funding supported a total investment of &euro;117m by these projects in rural areas.  </p>  <p>  Each of these projects is being led, implemented and delivered by a State-funded body, such as a local authority, LEADER Local Action Group or State Agency.  However, projects are collaborative in nature, often involving direct support by other such bodies or by philanthropic organisations or community bodies.</p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the successful projects, my Department engaged with each lead party to complete due diligence requirements. Final approval for projects is only issued following the completion of the relevant procurement processes, thereby providing a degree of certainty in relation to the cost of projects, many of which are small in scale.  Contractual arrangements are also drawn up with the release of funding based on the achievement of key milestones in the projects. </p>  <p>  No significant time delays or cost overruns have yet been identified through this process and good progress is already being made on the implementation of successful projects.  A number of the projects have already met their first milestone and had funding released.   To date, &euro;1,722,043 has been drawn down from the Fund by seven separate projects.  I expect that payments from the Fund will significantly accelerate over the coming weeks and months as further milestones are achieved across all the 84 projects.</p></reply>

There are universally accepted governance principles and norms that apply to civil service and public sector organisations.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published its 'Corporate Governance Standards for the Civil Service' which details the standards that should be met by bodies in the civil and public service including by my Department.</p>  <p>  The circulars and guidance of relevance to my Department issue from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Where relevant, all staff are made aware of these circulars and/or guidance. For example, all new staff are provided with information on the most relevant circulars at the commencement of their employment.  In general, these pre-date the establishment of the Department in July 2017 and include, for example, the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, and the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.  In most instances, new circulars and guidance are for the attention of specific business units within the Department, for example the Human Resources unit with regard to pay and pensions, or annual leave and the Finance Unit with regard to the Public Spending Code or Appropriation Account circulars. In these cases it is those business units responsible who are made aware of the circulars, and who ensure application or implementation, and follow up to ensure compliance, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that good governance is about delivering priorities, achieving objectives, behaving with integrity and acting in the public interest, and in ways that are consistent with legal, regulatory and Government policy obligations. The Department's Governance Framework seeks to underpin this and its continued development will be informed and developed on foot of the learning experiences of the Department and its stakeholders.</p></reply>

The second call for applications to the Fund was launched in April 2019, and will close on 6 August 2019.</p><p>- The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention.

Specific examples of measures in the Plan which are being delivered and will assist those who feel isolated or vulnerable in rural areas include:</p><p>- Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people living alone. Over &euro;6.9 million was invested in the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2018. The Scheme had a total of 44,763 participants at the end of 2018.</p><p>- Investment of &euro;46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime. Of that allocation, &euro;10 million will be available for purchases for the fleet in 2019.</p><p>- Continued operation of the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the main social inclusion programme of Government supporting local community groups and disadvantaged communities and individuals. The new SICAP 2018&ndash;2022 programme was launched in April 2018 and is providing opportunities for people to engage in a range of employment supports including the development of personal skills, lifelong learning, labour market training and one-to-one employment supports.</p><p>- Support for 450 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across rural Ireland which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. </p><p>- Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.</p><p>- Continued support for community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert.</p><p>- Funding allocation of over &euro;14 million for Local Link rural transport services in 2019, providing a vital service for rural communities.

An implementation plan for the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development in Ireland, published in 2016, is also currently at an advanced stage, and I am confident that these plans will propose further actions that will address isolation issues in our communities.</p>  <p>  Specific examples of actions being delivered by my Department which are helping those who feel isolated or vulnerable in communities include:</p>  <p>  - Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people living alone. During 2018, spend on the Scheme amounted to almost &euro;7 million, with over 19,200 applications for personal alarms approved. There have been a further 10,000 approved applications in the first six months of 2019. This is an important programme which enables older persons of limited means to continue to live in their own homes at the heart of their communities with confidence, independence and peace of mind.</p>  <p>  - The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, commenced a new five-year programme at the start of 2018, and is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a national programme that is delivered locally with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period to help those in the greatest need.  </p>  <p>  - Support for approximately 400 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across Ireland, with sheds present in all 32 counties, which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. Ireland continues to enjoy the highest per capita concentration of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in the world. I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds in 2018 and this year I have decided to build on that with a further &euro;500,000 in recognition of the contribution these groups are making to life in Ireland. A number of Women&rsquo;s Sheds have emerged in communities in recent times and in order to support this positive development I have decided to make this funding also available to these groups. </p>  <p>  - The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 which will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to address the challenges facing rural areas over the course of the programme period, particularly under the themes of economic development and social inclusion.</p>  <p>  - Volunteering plays a critical part in empowering individuals to become more involved in their communities and is proven to assist with the development of mental health wellbeing. My Department is currently in the process of developing a draft National Volunteering Strategy which it is anticipated will be completed later this year.</p></reply>

It is an estimate made by a Living Wage Technical Group, led by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice (VPSJ).  </p>  <p>  The living wage approach starts with an analysis of the expenditure likely to be incurred by an individual in an independent household for the essentials of life and calculates the minimum income required to support this.  Not everybody in the labour force is living independently and therefore do not necessarily need to achieve a MESL on a personal basis to achieve MESL on a household basis. </p>  <p>  By contrast, the national minimum wage is the legally-binding lowest average hourly rate that can be paid by an employer to an employee.  This rate is set and governed by the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, which applies to all employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary and casual employees, with some exceptions.  The Low Pay Commission was specifically established to make evidence-based recommendations regarding the national minimum wage, having regard to a range of criteria such as the state of the economy and labour markets, international comparisons and likely impacts on employment and competitiveness.  The current rate is &euro;9.80 per hour.</p>  <p>  The national minimum wage approach seeks to find the balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employers and competitiveness.  It is a pragmatic approach providing a clearly defined minimum hourly rate for employers, and giving them the freedom to pay higher rates, whilst also providing a measure of security for low-paid workers.  As it is legally enforceable, it provides protection for workers.</p>  <p>  The national minimum wage applies to all employee's including, if applicable, those employed in my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

There is no contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after they have reached an agreement with their landlord regarding their tenancy arrangement. </p>  <p>  With high premiums in place for vacant properties, and high rental inflation being experienced for in situ tenancies, the Department has had in place since start of 2015, a 'price flexible case-by-case' award approach for both new and existing tenancies.  This approach is set out in the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  The Framework specifically includes a provision for &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payment arrangements - where a 'top-up' arrangement is in place these can be regularised with the additional support provided.</p>  <p>  Where a tenant provides details of a 'top-up' arrangement, seeking additional support, no penalty is raised by the Department against the tenant, with the main consideration to ensure the person can remain in their current home. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are several differing elements involved in each calculating method.  For example, the Yearly Average (YA) method does not include a limit on credited contributions.  The interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA), as launched in January 2018, does have a limit on credits but allows up to 20 years HomeCaring periods be added to paid contributions to increase a person&rsquo;s rate.  The YA method rewards those with a shorter timespan between first and last social insurance contributions while TCA looks at a person&rsquo;s aggregated contributions without regard for timespan.  Under YA, there is no maximum number of contributions required, while under TCA 40 years is the maximum required.  </p>  <p>  The elements which make up each method are set out in law.  Accordingly, it is not possible to choose those elements from either method that may prove most advantageous to an applicant.  To allow pensioners choose the elements in how their pension is calculated would likely incur very significant costs which could further undermine the sustainability of the State Pension.  My department will spend over &euro;8 billion on pensions in 2019 and this figure is already increasing year on year to the tune of c.&euro;1 billion every five years based on demographic changes alone.  Instead, pensioners are paid using whichever of the two methods of calculation is most beneficial to them.     </p>  <p>  The person in question applied for a pension and was assessed with having a yearly average of 21 based on 922 reckonable paid contributions and 107 reckonable credited contributions over 48 years.  This places the person into the 20-29 rate band which equates to a payment rate equal to 85% of the maximum rate pension. </p>  <p>  A review took place on the person concerned as part of the on-going rate review project.  The review resulted in a payment rate equal to 82.02% of the maximum rate pension based on 922 reckonable paid contributions combined with 677 HomeCaring periods and 107 reckonable credits. </p>  <p>  As the person is already in receipt of 85% of the maximum rate of pension, it is more financially beneficial for them to remain on their existing payment.  A review outcome letter has issued informing the person concerned that their existing rate of payment will continue unchanged. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The protocol sets out the Department&rsquo;s requirements for organisations using the host mailing service.  The pension provider must have made an unsuccessful attempt to contact the scheme member.  The Department will forward letters to the last known address of the member based on its records if this address differs from that which the pension provider has.

The scheme was never intended as a support to businesses to hire staff.  The scheme is funded from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</p>  <p>  Up to 2011, the scheme provided a rebate of 60 per cent to employers who provided statutory redundancy payments to their employees.  I am advised by my Department that in Budget 2013, the rebate payment was abolished.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the social insurance fund at the time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefitting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies. It was not a targeted use of the resources of the Social Insurance Fund. </p>  <p>  The redundancy payments scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments.  Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, while continuing to trade, are required to submit verified financial information to prove this and are liable to the Social Insurance Fund for any redundancy payments made on their behalf.   This ensures that the current scheme takes into account both an employer's ability to pay redundancy payments and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer's financial position improves.</p>  <p>  Any proposals to restore the redundancy rebate scheme and any development of policy in this area would have to have regard to: the level of costs involved in restoring the rebate; the many other demands on the Social Insurance Fund including this Government's decisions to extend social insurance benefits to self-employed workers and to provide for paternity benefit and parental leave benefit; and other supports available to businesses who wish to hire staff. </p></reply>

It is available in all local authority areas and its introduction ensures that all social housing supports can be accessed through the local authorities, allowing tenants to take up full-time employment and keep their housing support, subject to adjustment of their differential rent.</p>  <p>  If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority. Accordingly, the determination of entitlement to HAP, including the assessment of an applicant's means, is governed by the same arrangements as for other social housing supports.</p>  <p>  The qualification criteria for social housing support are set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and in the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended, and are applied by all housing authorities in assessing individual households for support. </p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing supports in each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. There are currently three bands - with maximum income limits per individual (main applicant) set at &euro;35,000, &euro;30,000 and &euro;25,000 (the limits are higher for households with multiple adults and with children).  </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p></reply>

RAS tenancies are governed by the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 -2019.   Under the terms of the RAS scheme, payments by the tenant in excess of the rental amount specified in the RAS contract to the landlord are not permitted.  In a scenario where a landlord has requested a payment in excess of the agreed rental amount, the tenant has the option of referring a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 &ndash; 2019 and it would be a matter for the RTB to decide on the appropriate sanctions to apply.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented sector. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  In addition, the normal 20% discretion beyond the rent limits is increased to 50% for homeless households in the Dublin Region.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  This reflects the fact that, unlike Rent Supplement, where payment ceases in certain circumstances, HAP support can continue to be paid where a household&rsquo;s income increases, including for reasons of the tenant taking up full-time employment.  In those cases, it would therefore be expected that some tenants would consider rental options, which they source themselves in the private rental market, that would involve them paying an element of rent beyond the HAP rent limits, enabled to do so by their improved income position.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that HAP tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where they are not satisfied that the household would be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.  </p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 1 2019, there were over 45,000 active tenancies being supported under the HAP scheme. Collection of data in relation to the number of households making a top-up payment to their landlord does not form part of the standard reporting process of my Department.  However, the information available to the HAP Shared Service Centre operated by Limerick City and County Council indicates that approximately three quarters of all HAP tenancies are fully supported.</p></reply>

The capital programme includes recoupment for the purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment and the construction and upgrading of fire stations within the overall funding available. </p><p>While the fire authorities obviously have a critical role, the people that control buildings have primary statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of persons using the building. In this regard, inbuilt features such as layout and fire resistance are critical as are fire detection and alarm systems. Safety features should support early detection, safe evacuation of occupants and the containment of fires. The appropriate measures vary based on the scale, density and height of buildings and are set out in Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance and Codes of Practice. </p><p>It is important to note that there has been a steady decline in the number of fire incidents and the number of fatalities resulting from fires in Ireland. With a three year averaged annual fire death rate of less than six per million of population, Ireland is among the countries where fire fatalities are deemed to have been minimised.  Of course, we must remain vigilant and work to avoid the tragedy of fatalities from fire, the vast majority of which occur in the home. However, it is important to recognise the positive impact of improvements in community fire safety strategies and fire brigade response. </p><p>In terms of equipment, management of the number, type and age profile of fire appliances is a matter for each of the fire authorities based on their local needs and requirements. Continued investment in the national fleet is one of the key priorities for the Fire Services Capital Programme. Under the capital programmes since 2008, my Department has funded nine &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances and two turntable ladders for Dublin and close engagement continues with fire authorities in relation to future needs. In this regard, in assessing requirements, fire service management use multi-annual data of actual fires to determine &quot;Area Risk Categorisation&quot; (ARC) for each fire station area benchmarking against national standards, set out for the first time in the 2013 policy document &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;. </p><p>The ARC process helps fire service management establish a risk grading of: very high risk (A); high risk (B) medium risk (C); low risk (D); or very low risk (E) categories across areas. The initial fire station risk ratings for Dublin are published in the 2016 report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency &ndash; Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo;, and are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>FIRE   SERVICE</th><th>FIRE STATION</th><th>ARC RATING</th></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Tallaght</td><td>A1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Tara Street</td><td>A1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Dolphins Barn</td><td>A2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Finglas</td><td>A2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Kilbarrack</td><td>A2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Phibsboro</td><td>A2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Swords</td><td>A2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>B1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Dunlaoghaire</td><td>B1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>North Strand</td><td>B1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>B1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Donnybrook</td><td>B2</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Balbriggan</td><td>C1</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>Skerries</td><td>D1</td></tr></table></p><p>The &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo; policy document indicates that local authority fire services should have an initial response capability in place which is linked to the assessed Area Risk Category, as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Risk CategoryDescription</th><th>Risk Category</th><th>Standard Fire Appliance (Class B) Response Capability</th><th>Fire Brigade Travel Times</th><th>Associated Crew Levels (incl. crew commanders)</th></tr><tr><td>Very High</td><td>A</td><td>1st2nd3rd4th</td><td>in 8 minsin 10 minsin 15 minsin 20 mins</td><td>591317</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>B</td><td>1st2nd3rd</td><td>in 10 minsin 15 minsin 20 mins</td><td>5913</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>C</td><td>1st2nd3rd</td><td>in 10 minsin 20 minsin 30 mins</td><td>5913</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>D</td><td>1st2nd</td><td>in 20 minsin 40 mins</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Very Low</td><td>E</td><td>1st2nd</td><td>in 30 minsin 60 mins</td><td>59</td></tr></table></p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) oversees an external validation process across fire services. The External Validation Report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency&rdquo; indicates that the fire services provided in Dublin areas are meeting, and indeed exceed, the appropriate standards.</p><p>Operational response to a particular incident or category of incidents is a matter for each fire service, taking account of national policy and guidance. A National Incident Command System was developed  by the NDFEM in 2009, including appropriate training and support materials.  The Incident Commander decides on the appropriate course of action to be taken in any given situation, taking into consideration the balance of needs, risk and resources with particular regard to health, safety and welfare. </p><p>In relation to fighting fires in high-rise buildings, my Department issued guidance titled &ldquo;Fighting Fires in High-Rise Buildings&rdquo; in April 2011. This was part of a suite of 47 Standard Operational Guidance (SOG) documents developed between 2010 and 2012 by fire service personnel and issued by the NDFEM. A copy of the SOG concerned, SOG 3.02, is available on my Department's website at the following link:  . </p><p>Based on the foregoing the current arrangements in place at both national and local level for fire safety and fire service response, including in Dublin, are deemed appropriate and effective. These matters are kept under constant review by the NDFEM and its dedicated Management Board made up of key stakeholders, including chief executives of local authorities/fire authorities.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  While the revised draft guidelines had been expected to be published in Quarter 1 2019, some delays to the planned schedule arose, due to the recent publication of updated World Health Organisation (WHO) noise standards and the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues. </p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, there will shortly be an 8-week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report. Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. My Department will aim to commence the public consultation later in Q3 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfire and, more specifically, illegal burning. This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the recent spate of fires in various parts of the country, including earlier this year at Torc Mountain in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.  Wild fires are not a natural phenomenon in Ireland and can have a local impact on species that cannot escape, or that lose breeding habitat as a result. Such impacts are generally fairly short term, but could be very serious for species that are already in decline, such as curlew. Some plant and moss species  may be lost  or greatly reduced. UK research showed that where scrub such as gorse is burned it can have a lasting impact on soils and cause increased erosion which can in turn impact on rivers through increasing siltation of the water, especially if this burning happens repeatedly. </p>  <p>  I strongly condemn the spate of wildfires in recent years and would appeal to members of the public to be conscious of the dangers posed by fire on open ground. Even planned and/or "controlled" burning can get out of hand very quickly, so it is critically important that every member of society realises the damage that can be caused to property and, indeed, the health and welfare of family, neighbours and the wider community, and the responding emergency services. The main source of wild fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.  Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.</p>  <p>   With regard to the National Parks, on an on-going basis, officials from my Department  are in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service. With regard to gorse fires in particular, there are a number of Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Groups that explore issues surrounding such fires. My Department, through its National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), is one of a number of agencies represented on such groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on these groups and lead any criminal investigation). There are a number of these groups in different locations around the country. They are convened by the Fire Services Department of the relevant Local Authority and the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority. Generally, the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority would chair the meetings and maintains records. Usually, the membership of such groups would include representation from stakeholders such as:</p>  <p>  - Fire Services Department of the Local Authority</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute;</p>  <p>  - Forest Service Section of the Department of Agriculture and Food</p>  <p>  - NPWS</p>  <p>  - Coillte</p>  <p>  - Teagasc</p>  <p>  My Department (NPWS) meets and liaises with the Fire Officer directly as appropriate and necessary. For example to review arrangements and practical details in respect of our National Parks and other recreational properties e.g. re access point, codes, etc.</p>  <p>  Some 14 per cent of the terrestrial area of the State is designated and this includes many remote and inaccessible areas.  Most land in special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership.  Through the NPWS, my Department directly manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country.   Given the sensitivity of these habitats, with regard to firebreaks, there are a number of ecological concerns with regard to their use. A balance has to be achieved between works necessary or desirable to assist in the control of wild fires within designated areas on the one hand and the sustainable conservation and protection of the qualifying interests within such sites. Where possible, targeted and minimal on site work &ndash; including the cutting back of combustible material (furze, heathers, over-grown grassland areas) &ndash; to create these &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; could help to control the spread of wild fires, without impacting significantly on habitats.  My Department remains very committed to the prevention, early detection and minimisation of the impacts of such fires, and recently piloted a joint action with Coillte using drones to assist  in the early identification of fires and communication of real-time information to my staff when they work with the emergency services to prevent such fires from spreading. </p>  <p>  Given the sheer scale of property involved, (for example, Killarney National Park on its own comprises over 10,000 Hectares (26,000 acres) coupled with the remote locations of much of the designated lands and the sporadic occurrence and dynamic nature of such fires, it is very difficult to provide a visible &ldquo;presence&rdquo; on the ground to discourage and prevent unauthorised burning in the countryside.  Equally, trying to identify those who deliberately set fires in open areas without concern for the consequences can be challenging.  NPWS staff remain ever-vigilant when conditions exist that might result in fires in the National Parks.</p></reply>

The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy. </p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the use of the area by hillwalkers, climbers and the public in general. It should be noted that this Department has no statutory function regarding the provision of access to private lands. However, the Estate has allowed a permissive access to its hugely popular walking route for many decades and the Department hopes that this would continue under any new ownership arrangements and the Department has conveyed this desire directly to the vendors and their agent.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Estate has been an excellent neighbour to the National Park, working closely with it on habitat management and the promotion of our stunning Wicklow Mountains for tourism, film making and amenity.

This year I have allocated &euro;1.824m and &euro;2.5m respectively to these schemes. Details of these projects and funding, and the criteria by which they are assessed, are available on my Department's website and local authority websites. While the closing dates for applications have now passed, my Department will remain in close contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best possible use is made of all funds, including by reallocating funds where certain projects do not proceed within agreed timeframes. </p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building or historic structure, the best advice is generally to contact the Heritage Officer or Architectural Conservation Officer in the local authority who is well placed to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with its renovation or conservation.</p></reply>
