    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-21a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100074#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</p>  <p>  As part of a whole of Government approach, my Department is engaged in forward planning with the other Departments involved in addressing all issues relevant to the UK's decision to leave the European Union. This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have said in response to this question in the past, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements and accordingly there is no reason to revisit previous decisions on the location of military installations across the country, including in the border region. The avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the draft Brexit agreement reached last week between the EU and the UK government. As such, there are no plans to reintroduce a new Army barracks or Defence Forces base in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, and as I have also outlined previously in this regard, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department will of course continue to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-21a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100074#WRA01200"><p>A review of the Defence Forces psychiatric service recommended the employment of a full time military psychiatrist. The previous incumbent providing these services to the Defence Forces on contract retired in May 2018 while arrangements were being made to implement this recommendation. </p>  <p>  In the intervening period, patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE A&amp;E Departments. Here they are assessed by the duty on-call psychiatric staff who triage referrals and these patients will either be admitted for in-patient care or referred onward to HSE outpatient psychiatric services where appropriate.</p>  <p>  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, efforts were made to engage a locum psychiatrist.  However, this proved to be unsuccessful.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently, it was agreed to launch a procurement process to contract a third-party private service provider for psychiatric services as a bridging arrangement pending the appointment of a locum or full time psychiatrist.  </p>  <p>  In addition, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist was launched on 26th July 2018 and closed on 30th September 2018. No applications were received for this competition and further options are now under consideration as to how to proceed. </p>  <p>  It must be stressed that there is no delay in referring patients requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. When presenting to HSE A &amp;amp; E Departments, those requiring hospitalisation are immediately admitted. For non-urgent outpatient cases the waiting time is approximately 3 months. In order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate. </p>  <p>  With regard to mental health supports generally, I can assure the Deputy that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me. Mental health services are part of a range of medical and non-medical services provided to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them. </p>  <p>  In addition to the clinical supports I have already outlined, non-medical mental health services are provided by the Personnel Support Service (PSS).  The PSS makes confidential services, including critical incident stress management, and psychosocial support available to all Defence Forces personnel through its network of Barrack Personnel Support Service Officers and occupational social workers at formation, unit and barrack level. </p>  <p>  The PSS also supports contingents before, during and after overseas deployments and its trained personnel are deployed in response to any significant operational incidents at home or overseas. The service is also available to the families of serving personnel. </p>  <p>  As additional support, my Department has arranged the provision of a confidential counselling, referral and support service, on a wide range of personal and work related issues, for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence members. A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24/7 basis 365 days a year and is staffed by fully-trained and experienced counsellors. </p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the available medical services offer comprehensive supports to Defence Forces members, I can assure the Deputy that they are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-21a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112100074#WRA01400"><p>Ireland joined Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in December, 2017 following Government and D&aacute;il approval. As part of our participation in PESCO, Ireland has committed to regularly increase our defence budgets in real terms. It should be noted that regularly does not mean annually but rather over the medium term.  The allocations for defence announced in the budget for 2019 mean that Ireland&rsquo;s defence expenditure will increase in real terms over the coming three years.  </p>  <p>  Joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer. Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency Projects. The projects where Ireland has confirmed our participation relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. Costs associated with participation on these projects would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote</p>  <p>  As a participant in PESCO, Ireland is required to participate in one PESCO project.  As identified in the Council Decision of 6th March establishing the first list of PESCO projects, I have confirmed Ireland's participation in two PESCO projects - (1) The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance. Ireland also confirmed Observer status on 8 first round PESCO projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to the second round of PESCO projects agreed this week at the Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland, while not committing to participating in any further projects, did confirm interest as Observer in the following 3 projects :</p>  <p>  - Project EU Radio Navigation Solutions (EURAS) </p>  <p>  - Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS)  </p>  <p>  - European UAS Competence, Education and Training Centre </p>  <p>  At this stage, there have been no additional costs associated with PESCO related activities in 2018 other than costs associated with attendance by Defence Forces Subject Matter Experts at PESCO project planning meetings.  This may change as capabilities are developed through the PESCO projects. However, it is expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of member States should prove cost neutral in terms of overall projected defence expenditure.</p></reply>

Since 5 February 2003, the Garda&iacute; have requested support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport on occasion. The cost of the presence of Defence Forces at Shannon Airport performing ATCP duties with regard to all military aircraft landing at Shannon Airport in 2018, up to 14 November 2018, is &euro;165,157.74 for 270 deployments. For security reasons it would not be appropriate to disclose the details regarding the number of personnel assigned to each deployment.</p>  <p>  These costs relate to security duty allowance paid to members of the Defence Forces, rations and fuel.

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. </p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Government established the Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service pay policy.  Following the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission report in May 2017, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.  </p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement</p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service. This measure, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, will be effective from 1 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  There are many factors and personal circumstances which can give rise to an individual needing support and advice in respect of particular financial difficulties. The Personnel Support Service provides a confidential information, education, support and referral service to Defence Forces personnel and their families, giving access to information and services within and outside the military community. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, which the Commission identified in Chapter 6 of its report in May 2017. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and military management have collated and prepared the data requested. An initial tranche of material relating to Air Corps pilots was submitted earlier this year. Further material relating to the broader Defence sector has been sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are co-ordinating the response on behalf of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

There is no legal basis for the establishment of an EU army, and there is no proposal set out to change this.</p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions. </p>  <p>  Any decision to further deepen EU cooperation in the area of security and defence with a move to a common defence would require a unanimous decision of the European Council. In addition, any decision by Ireland to participate in any such Common Defence would require the approval of the people in a referendum.  Ireland remains constitutionally debarred from participation in any such EU common defence given our Constitutional provisions and the Lisbon Treaty protocols. </p>  <p>  At a time when the world has become a more unstable and insecure place, Ireland remains fully supportive of the efforts of EU member States, within the Treaty provisions, to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the challenging security environment, including in the area of defence. </p>  <p>  These efforts are been advanced through the implementation of the EU Global Strategy of Foreign Policy and Security, the Commissions European Defence Action Plan and through enhanced cooperation with international partners.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to all of these areas will as always be both constructive and realistic and we remain strong supporters of initiatives which improve the capacity of the EU to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN and to delivering the necessary capabilities, both civil and military in this regard. </p>  <p>  While we choose to remain neutral, this is not out of any lack of interest in issues underpinning conflicts or any isolationist stance.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international relations is founded on full and active engagement in the international community in support of international peace and security and the rule of law.  We follow and will continue to follow this policy approach - militarily neutral but fully engaged &ndash; because, as committed members of the United Nations, we subscribe fully to the principles set out in the UN Charter.</p></reply>

I did however meet with two individuals in relation to the matters raised. </p>  <p>  As I have clearly stated to this House, the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a priority for me. </p>  <p>  In this regard, there are a number of processes already in train relating to reviewing health and safety procedures in the Air Corps.  Firstly, in September 2016, I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps which were received in late 2015 and early 2016. The report of the independent third party review was received by my Department in June 2017. Although the report found that the Defence Force's regime appears to be capable of meeting statutory requirements, it makes a number of observations including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure monitoring.  It also notes that the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such matters. I sent the report to those who had made disclosures for their views and I am considering the next steps in the process having received those views and in the context of ongoing litigation.</p>  <p>  Separately, and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the HSA to improve its health and safety regime. I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances. Subject to completion of the improvement plan, the HSA investigation is closed.  However, it must be noted that Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment. The Air Corps is fully committed to implementing improved safety measures that protect workers from potential exposures to chemicals and will ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable.</p>  <p>   As litigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</p></reply>

While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks. </p><p>I want to pay tribute to the significant security role which the Naval Service routinely carries out. By its nature, often that security role goes unrecognised or unacknowledged, but it is vital to Ireland's national priorities and interests.</p><p>In relation to its sea-fishery protection role, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 established the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) as the competent Authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland. </p><p>A Service Level Agreement is in place which underpins the relationship between the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Defence Organisation.  This Agreement provides for the development of an Annual Control Plan and for agreed reporting and training arrangements.  The agreement also provides a forum for sharing information between parties and for dealing with fisheries' control and enforcement issues.  </p><p>In accordance with this Agreement, the 2018 Annual Control Plan states a target range of between 1,090 and 1,267 patrol days. The lower figure reflects a Naval Service presence in the Mediterranean with the upper figure in place in instances if a Naval Service vessel does not deploy to the Mediterranean. </p><p>The Naval Service has an establishment of 1,094 personnel with a current strength at approximately 92%.  The breakdown by rank is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Rank </th><th>Establishment</th><th>Strength as at 31 October</th></tr><tr><td>Commodore</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Captain</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Commander</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

This is supplemented in relation to the training of apprentices and Marine Engineers as required through other academic institutions. This holistic approach to training ensures that personnel have the necessary skill set to deliver the broad range of services that the Naval Service provides to the State and internationally as required.</p></reply>

This allocation emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all the roles assigned by Government.</p><p>The Defence Vote has been increased by &euro;37.5 million to &euro;745 million. Capital funding has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper.</p><p>The 2019 pay allocation of &euro;515.6 m has increased by &euro;6.3 million to meet the costs of Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020<i></i>commitments arising in 2019. An additional &euro;2.2 million has been provided to meet essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.</p><p>An additional &euro;10 million has been allocated to meet the retirement costs of ex members of the Permanent Defence Force and certain dependants, bringing the total allocation for the Army Pensions Vote for 2019 to &euro;249 million.</p><p>Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising the national finances during the financial crisis. The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales.</p><p>Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. </p><p>The Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due under the Agreement from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>New entrants to the Defence Forces will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to amendments to the pay scales for new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011. </p><p>By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement, the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, which the Commission identified in Chapter 6 of its report in May 2017. The Commission's work is on-going and my Department will continue to engage throughout the process.</p></reply>

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 347 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 138 personnel.</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are shown in the tabular statement beneath. </p><p>The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment with 347 personnel and on 22 May 2018, the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNIFIL for a further 12 month period.  </p><p>Until recently, Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL.  The Finnish contingent also  included an Estonian Platoon comprising some 36 personnel.  Due to other National commitments both Finland and Estonia announced earlier this year their intention to withdraw from the Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL by the end of 2018.</p><p>Efforts are on-going to source a partner country to replace the Finnish contingent but, in the interim, I have approved the additional deployment of approximately 106 Defence Forces Personnel to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the Finnish contingent for a 12 month period.On 15 November, Ireland assumed full duties and responsibilities of IRISHBATT for the next 12 months until November 2019.</p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p><b>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS AS OF 01 NOVEMBER 2018</b><table><tr><th>UN MISSIONS </th><th></th></tr><tr><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ<br /><br />UNIFIL 112th Infantry Battalion<br /><br />UNIFIL Sector West HQ</td><td>10<br /><br />329<br /><br />8</td></tr><tr><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) Israel &amp;amp; Syria</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic of the Congo) </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>UNDOF (COS Staff/FHQ Staff - Camp Faouar - Bravo side)<br /><br />UNDOF 58th Infantry Group (Camp Faouar - Bravo side) </td><td>8<br /><br />130</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>504</td></tr><tr><td>UN MANDATED MISSIONS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EUFOR (EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>EUTM Mali (EU-led Training Mission) </td><td>20 </td></tr><tr><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) HQ </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>Naval Service EU Mission (Op Sophia) <br /><br />Operational HQ/Floating HQ (Operation Sophia HQ - 3 in OHQ &amp;amp; 2 in FHQ) </td><td><br /><br />5</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH UN MISSIONS</td><td>546</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Staff Officer, High Level Planning Group, Vienna</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL SERVING WITH OSCE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EU MILITARY STAFF</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brussels</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES/ADVISERS/STAFF</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Military Representative to EU (Brussels)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Liaison Officer of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>EU OHQ Operation Althea, Mons, Belgium</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Liaison Officer to SHAPE &amp;amp; Military Co-Op Division, Mons, Belgium</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Joint Technical Group for Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (JTGDDR) in Mozambique (part time basis)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL SERVING OVERSEAS</td><td>565</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Having regard to commitments made under public service pay agreements, members of the PDF can make representations in relation to their pay and conditions through their representative associations. </p>  <p>  The C&amp;A scheme, since its inception in the early 1990&rsquo;s has provided the framework to progress many successful negotiated agreements between Defence management and the PDF Representative Associations.

Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence, including national spending on defence and security. </p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's participation in Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), Ireland has committed to regularly increase our defence budgets in real terms. It should be noted that regularly does not mean annually but rather over the medium term.  The allocations for defence announced in the budget for 2019 mean that Ireland&rsquo;s defence expenditure will increase in real terms over the coming three years.  </p>  <p>  Joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer. Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency Projects. The projects where Ireland has confirmed our participation relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. Costs associated with participation on these projects would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote. </p>  <p>  It is expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of member States should prove cost neutral in terms of overall projected defence expenditure.</p></reply>

Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions. </p>  <p>  The European treaties require that the EU respects the specific and different policies of Member States in the area of security and defence and that has not been changed or compromised by our participation in PESCO.  In addition, the Irish Protocols to the Lisbon Treaty specifically states that the Lisbon Treaty does not provide for the creation of a European army.  </p>  <p>  The participation criteria for PESCO expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols and will respect the Member States constitutional provisions.

Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.

Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons set out to 2021. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is advanced by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is advanced by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.

In addition the White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the Reserve and confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations. </p>  <p>  For the current year, a budget of &euro;2.15 million is provided, of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve.  Within this budget, seven days annual paid training is provided for in respect of each effective member of the Reserve.  The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2018 along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that members of the Amy Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are afforded the opportunity to avail of training and update their skills on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and this year we are taking delivery of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). These aircraft will be delivered in 2019 and 2020. Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently underway in this regard. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with a fourth, to be named the L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in recent weeks. In addition, planning is underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  The examples given, while not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years. I have asked my staff to review the cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport and to compare it to the cost of a similar passport in many other jurisdictions. I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;8.50 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.70 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.</p>  <p>  Based on 2017 application volumes, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of eliminating the passport application fee for applicants over 70 years of age to be over &euro;3.7m.  Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed.  </p>  <p>  In the context of the services provided by the Passport Service, I would like to draw attention to the well-advanced Passport Reform Programme, one element of which is an online passport application service which was launched on 30 March 2017. </p>  <p>  To date over 273,000 adults have renewed their passport using this online facility. At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications. The Passport Service is in the process of expanding this service further by the end of 2018.  </p>  <p>  The online passport application service enables adults to renew their passports within ten working days without the need for paperwork or witnesses. The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere in the world. Whilst the online service does not distinguish between applicants based on age, applicants can be assured that the online system will be the cheapest as well as the most efficient, secure and convenient way to apply to renew their passport.</p></reply>

The violent events in recent months have clearly demonstrated the risks of the continued absence of political progress. Ireland has worked consistently to maintain an international focus on the issue, and support for the two state solution.</p>  <p>  The EU remains firmly committed to a two state solution to the conflict. With the prospects for peace continuing to deteriorate on the ground, EU Foreign Ministers have discussed the Peace Process on numerous occasions over the last year, most recently at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in August. There we considered how the EU can productively engage and better use all the levers at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. We must ensure that the EU&rsquo;s support for the region is focused on delivery of the two-state solution.</p>  <p>  EU colleagues share a great concern about threats to the viability of the two state solution, stemming principally from the settlement policy of the Israeli Government, which is diminishing the physical space in which a Palestinian state will be built. </p>  <p>  Along with other EU colleagues I have sought to encourage and influence the United States in its current consideration of a Middle East initiative, so long as it addresses the needs of both parties to the conflict. I have also visited the region three times since taking up my role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage directly with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders on how Ireland can add value and help facilitate progress. And I have indicated my intention to hold an informal ministerial meeting in Ireland, for a small number of Arab and European Foreign Ministers. I believe this style of gathering could be useful in promoting the exchange of ideas on how to restart the stagnated peace process.</p>  <p>  This issue will remain a high priority on my agenda in the coming months.</p></reply>

The reports of violence, arbitrary detention, and persecution of civil society leaders, peaceful protesters and those who have assisted them paint a troubling picture of repression. </p>  <p>  I once again strongly condemn any use of violence and reiterate my calls on all actors to respect the right to peaceful protest and to freedom of expression. I also call on authorities to ensure full accountability for all acts of violence, while ensuring due process for all prisoners.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers and the worrying accounts they contain of a pattern of human rights abuses and repression. Compounding this climate of impunity is a lack of official cooperation with the international missions investigating human rights abuses.  </p>  <p>  The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was expelled from the country following the publication of its report. The Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) and the Follow-Up Mechanism of Nicaragua (MESENI), set up by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR), have also both reported difficulties in working with the authorities. I urge the Government of Nicaragua to allow the OHCHR officials to re-enter the country, and to cooperate fully with the GIEI and MESENI, so that they can effectively carry out their important work. </p>  <p>  Ireland regularly engages on this issue at EU and international level. The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, calls on the government of Nicaragua to act on the findings and recommendations by the IACHR and OHCHR, to ensure full accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and the disarming and disbanding of armed groups. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the declaration in October by the EU High Representative on behalf of the EU on the situation in Nicaragua.</p>  <p>  The statement expressed the EU&rsquo;s serious concern at the situation, and urged the government of Nicaragua to allow the return of the OHCHR to enable it to continue its mission, as well as calling on the government of Nicaragua to stop the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, halt arrests based on laws which criminalise peaceful protest, allow free peaceful demonstrators and re-establish the full respect of due process for all detainees. </p>  <p>  I echo the EU call on the government of Nicaragua to resume the national dialogue. I believe that inclusive dialogue remains the only way of negotiating a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis, and of restoring the trust of the Nicaraguan people in the country&rsquo;s institutions. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU action taken to support international and local initiatives to address the human rights situation, promote a culture of peace, and to provide support to victims of the crisis and their families. It is important to monitor the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and its impact on the population.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, have been monitoring the situation closely. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Jaentschke, was met by officials in my Department on 1 October last and was informed of our strong attachment to the European Union position on Nicaragua. He was also advised of the importance we attach to the establishment of a genuine national reconciliation process. </p>  <p>  We have been engaging regularly with partner organisations on the ground, and raising the issue at international level where appropriate. Ireland greatly values the work of these partner organisations and will continue to engage with them. </p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1 per cent on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.</p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime.</p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p></reply>

However, there is a Revenue concession which allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements (vitamins, minerals and fish oils).  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small.  However, this concession is proving to be extremely problematic. </p>  <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry has made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to a range of food supplements.  There are concerns that while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% VAT rate.  Their argument is generally that the products concerned are similar and compete with other products that are zero rated.  </p>  <p>  There has been protracted correspondence on the issues raised which has raised concerns regarding possible non-compliance in the sector, in particular the zero rating of products that should be standard rated which may result in a degree of unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.  </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s position is that food supplements are not food and, as such, are not entitled under VAT law to the zero rate of VAT; therefore, the standard rate of VAT applies.  The concession in relation to vitamins and the like is proving unworkable as the industry seeks to use the concession to achieve a zero rating for much of the product range in the sector.    </p>  <p>  After consultations between Revenue, Department of Health and my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018, reservations were expressed by the Department of Health as to the implications a change might may have on the promotion of food supplements in certain circumstances.  For these reasons, I decided not to make any changes in this year&rsquo;s Budget and Finance Bill.  However, I have asked my officials to address this matter in the context of the Tax Strategy Group next year.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.</p><p>The patronage process for 12 of the primary schools to be established in 2019 has commenced. The patronage process for the remaining schools, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, will also be run at a later date, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>An initial phased start-up is envisaged for the new schools, which typically involves the use of interim accommodation. However, this is the first time the requirement for new schools is set out over a 4-year horizon and this will provide a better lead-in period for the planning and delivery of permanent accommodation solutions.  Following on from the announcement, the locations for all of the schools will be determined as part of the site acquisition process.  </p><p>The new primary school due to be established in 2020 to serve the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR/Cherrywood school planning area is currently at Planning compliance stage.  When planning compliance is met, the project will proceed to tender stage. This is expected to be before the end of the year or early 2019, for delivery in 2020. Site acquisition processes in respect of the remaining two schools referred to by the Deputy are currently underway and are being progressed in line with accommodation provision requirements.</p></reply>

It builds on the good work already happening in schools to ensure that best practice in whole-school wellbeing promotion is embedded across the system.  The policy outlines a multicomponent, whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.  This policy requires that a Wellbeing Promotion Process is developed and implemented, through the use of the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process, in all schools by 2023.</p><p>The policy includes a set of Statements of Effective Practice in relation to wellbeing promotion within the school system. The statements will support schools in reviewing their current provision in four key areas of wellbeing promotion, culture, curriculum, policy and partnership and in setting goals for improvement.  The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice is available on my Department&rsquo;s website for information.</p><p>In order to support schools in the implementation of this Wellbeing Policy it is planned to develop and rollout a comprehensive programme of professional development, commencing in 2019.  This will include facilitating the engagement of schools in the school self-evaluation wellbeing promotion process, which will build professional capacity in schools.  It also includes the provision of a comprehensive and easily-accessible set of resources to address school-identified wellbeing promotion needs.  The roll out will be aligned with the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme and the Schools for Health Programme delivered through the HSE, Health Promotion Service.  Schools may continue to access existing support available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), Health and Wellbeing Team, the Junior Cycle for Teachers and National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS). </p><p>There are many resources that have been developed which support implementation of the wellbeing policy in the school context.It is a matter for the school management to consider use, having due regard for the aims and objectives of the SPHE curriculum and the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Guidelines.  Schools are also advised to be cognisant of DES, Circular 0042 &amp;amp; 43 /2018 and when considering collaborating with external agencies or commercial concerns in doing work related to wellbeing promotion in schools.  </p><p>My Department does not provide funding for any programmes for which it has no direct involvement or oversight function, nor is it in a position to endorse or review such programmes,  as for instance, the example provided in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. School authorities must therefore look to both the appropriateness of using any external resource, programme or process and the resourcing implications thereof to the school.</p></reply>

The Strategy commits to reviewing this target in 2020, with a view to setting an appropriate revised target for 2025.  </p>  <p>  The current figure is 12% (Labour Force Survey, Q2 2018, CSO)</p>  <p>  A new policy framework for employee development, 'Supporting Working Lives and Enterprise Growth in Ireland', was developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners.  This new approach will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce as it has a particular focus on employees those who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the NFQ, engaged in state supported skills development by 2021. Participation by employees in relevant courses will be provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  This new initiative is also a significant part of our national efforts to implement the European Commission's Upskilling Pathways Recommendation: New Opportunities for Adults, as almost half of those with less than an upper secondary qualification are in employment. My Department has been working with partners on the implementation of the recommendation &ndash; which aims to help adults with less than upper second level education acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills. My Department has established a multi&ndash;agency steering group to identify the priority cohorts and appropriate measures to implement the recommendation.  This informed my Department's recent response to a request from the Commission for information regarding arrangements in Ireland on upskilling pathways interventions. The response presented the overall context for Upskilling Pathways in Ireland, including key background information that the Commission would find useful, as well as information on existing and planned provision. The Commission are conducting an audit of interventions across Member States and hope to report back on their findings by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberation. </p><p>Having relatively high minimum entry requirements (MERs) in core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics is one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.  The 2011 Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and subsequent review identified the need to raise standards of achievement and included plans to raise the entry requirements in the core subjects over time. </p><p>The changes to the minimum entry requirements were introduced from 2019, rather than 2018, so as not to impact students who had already commenced senior cycle and who intended sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2018.  However to have applied this criterion to undergraduate students who might wish to apply for the Professional Master of Education qualification at some time in the future would mean deferring the changes for four years or more.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that not all applicants will meet the minimum entry requirements in Irish, English and Maths at the first attempt, there is no requirement that these minimum grades be achieved in one sitting of the Leaving Cert. Furthermore, there are a number of alternative qualifications that can take the place of the relevant Leaving Cert grade.  The list of alternative qualifications in the subject(s) concerned are outlined in the published Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2018 and available on my Department's website  (see <i>www.education.ie</i>).</p></reply>

I am advised that this matter was fully investigated by CAB and an investigation file was submitted to the Office of the DPP, with directions received on 29 August 2017, that there be no prosecutions.</p>  <p>  Separately, in relation to the Mahon Tribunal, I am advised by the Garda authorities that CAB completed its review of the final Mahon Tribunal Report and the report was submitted to the DPP who, on 21 February 2018, directed there be no prosecutions. </p>  <p> In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act was signed into law on 5  June 2018 and commenced in full on 30 July.  The Act introduces a number of additional offences to give better effect to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, as well as providing for some of the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The Act creates several new offences to strengthen the law on corruption in Ireland.  New offences include:</p>  <p>  - Offering or agreeing to accept a gift, consideration or advantage to induce another person to exert an improper influence over an act of a foreign or public official.</p>  <p>  - Making use of confidential information obtained in the course of duties by an official in order to gain an advantage.</p>  <p>  - Giving a gift, consideration or advantage where a person knows or reasonably ought to know that the gift will be used to facilitate a corruption offence. </p>  <p>  - A new strict liability offence for corporate bodies whose management, employees or subsidiaries commit a corruption offence with the intention of securing an advantage for the company. It shall be a defence for the body corporate to prove they took reasonable steps to prevent this. The penalty for conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine.</p>  <p>  The Act extends the categories of persons to whom the presumptions relating to corrupt donations will apply, to include family members and close business associates, as recommended by the Mahon Tribunal. It also creates a presumption of corrupt enrichment whereby a public official who has not declared an interest in land or other property, when obliged to do so, can be presumed to have obtained it as an inducement or reward for doing an act in relation to his or her office.</p>  <p>  Penalties under the Act aim to be sufficiently strong to reflect the serious social and economic harm corruption can do, particularly when committed by public officials. Sentences of up to 10 years are provided for as well as unlimited fines upon conviction on indictment. The Act provides for a penalty of forfeiture of office if an Irish official is found guilty of corruption on indictment, as recommended by UNCAC. The forfeiture of office penalty will not apply where there is already a process for a position to be terminated by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, or where the power of removal is derived from a Constitutional power.</p></reply>

Ethnic and LGBT liaison officers in each Division also play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage respect and understanding within communities and to help prevent hate and racist crime.

Our laws need to ensure that the individuals can use the internet free from harm while also ensuring that freedom of expressions is not unduly interfered with.    </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in December 2016, the Government approved the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill to address the criminal law elements of the LRC's report.  Subsequently, Deputy Brendan Howlin published a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill entitled the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 which completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government. The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications. The Bill creates new offences to deal with the distribution of intimate images without consent. The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications, and including communication about a person. This Bill will therefore deal with recommendations 15-18 of the Report on Cyber Security for Children and Young Adults. </p>  <p>  Cabinet agreed in May this year to cease work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin's Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as soon as possible. Officials in my Department have met with Labour Party officials with the intention of identifying and bringing forward any necessary Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be as effective as possible. I am currently awaiting legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in relation to these proposed amendments and I am committed to enacting this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

This pressure has increased further in the last number of months with an increase in the numbers of persons claiming international protection and a growth in the percentage of protection applicants who require assistance with accommodation.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the State can continue to provide accommodation for all protection applicants and continue to comply with the EU Reception Directive which was transposed into Irish law in June of this year, RIA has, since September, arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity.  RIA is also increasing the capacity of the mainstream system by opening new centres.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this expansion, one hotel in the Magheracloone area of South Monaghan is currently providing emergency beds for protection applicants.  RIA does not have exclusive use of this hotel and it continues to operate as a commercial entity. Applicants are accommodated there for a short period before they are moved into mainstream accommodation system where they will have full access to all the services provided by  the State to protection applicants. Staff in my Department are in close contact with the management of the hotel to ensure that emergency needs are met as necessary. On the evening of the 13 November 2018 there were 87 persons residing in this Hotel. This included single males, single females and some families.  Of those 87 residents, 18 were under the age of eighteen and were in the care of their parents or guardians.</p></reply>

It is important to note that SHA focuses solely on expenditure for health purposes and excludes other expenditures, such as elements of social care expenditure, which would also come under the remit of my Department. While there are known issues in the international comparability of SHA estimates, such as those around Out-of-Pocket and Long-Term Care expenditures, SHA still represents a useful approach to measuring the level of health expenditure on health goods and services, including public and private expenditure, across countries. </p>  <p>  The SHA methodology produces estimates of health expenditure in the currency and price level of the relevant country. Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are used to turn these estimates into a common currency, valued at a uniform price level. The values resulting from this exercise should reflect only differences in the volumes of goods and services consumed in countries. For this calculation the OECD uses PPPs based on Gross Domestic Product while Eurostat uses Actual Individual Consumption PPPs. The differences in these approaches reflects the set of prices included in their calculation. </p>  <p>  GDP is a measure of all expenditures in an economy. PPP based on prices from GDP includes the most comprehensive coverage of goods and services. Irish GDP has experienced significant volatility in recent years as a result of globalised activities in the economy. My Department have been in communication with the OECD to clarify whether this has distorted the GDP PPP for Ireland, however it is not clear at this point whether this is the case. More generally, the OECD and Eurostat note that while GDP is a good indicator of the level of economic activity, it is not an accurate measure of material well-being, when material well-being is defined in terms of individual goods and services consumed by households, that is, the goods and services that households consume to satisfy their individual needs.</p>  <p>  AIC relates more to the domestic consumption of goods and services. It includes all goods and services consumed by households whether purchased by themselves or provided by Government or Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households, whereas GDP includes items such as net exports.</p>  <p>  For certain countries, such as Ireland, there is a significant difference in the value of the AIC and GDP PPP. Given the importance of this parameter for measuring the volume of health goods and services consumed in Ireland, work is ongoing by my officials to evaluate the most appropriate PPP to use in international comparisons.</p></reply>

The provision of mobile telecommunications services is subject to a requirement to secure a wireless telegraphy licence to access the required radio spectrum.  The award of such licences, including the application of qualifying terms and conditions such as quality of service and minimum population coverage, and the associated monitoring of compliance by licensed providers with those terms and conditions is a matter for the statutorily independent Communications Regulator, ComReg.</p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. The Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. An Implementation Group is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the Taskforce actions. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, an additional 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018.</p><p>As Minster for Communications, it is important that both I and my officials engage on a regular basis with telecoms operators on issues of relevance to the development of the sector. In relation to engagement with providers on improving coverage, a number of Departmental officials meet with individual companies and representative groups in relation to their specific commitments under the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce report.  </p><p>The type of actions for delivery by the telecommunications operators in this regard include work on identifying blackspot locations needing prioritisation; identifying, in consultation with Local Authorities and other key stakeholders, optimal locations for additional infrastructure to improve 4G coverage;  introduction of WiFi calling; and reporting on activities undertaken to optimise the performance of their networks. </p><p>Discussions arising at such meetings with Industry inform the regular quarterly progress reports, which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and that of the Department of Rural and Community Development. The minutes of meetings of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Group are also published on both Departments&rsquo; websites.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p><p>Much of the work of the Taskforce, in addition to enhancing 4G coverage, also provides a strong foundation for growing next generation capacity, including 5G. In paving the way for 5G deployment in Ireland, and future auctions, consideration will need to be given to a number of factors, including quality of coverage as well as geographical spread<font color="#005594">.</font></p></reply>

However, in identifying the appropriate policy interventions the priority has also been to ensure that the approach taken to address energy poverty will  also not adversely impact the housing supply situation. </p>  <p>To find a way forward that supports action in the two critical policy areas of energy poverty and housing supply, options for improving energy efficiency in the rental sector will be proposed by an advisory Group composed of my Department, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and SEAI. These options will be consulted on early in 2019 as part of developing the next Long Term Renovation Strategy.</p></reply>

In that context, my Department is currently working on a Road Traffic Bill to provide, in the main, for graduated penalties for speeding offences. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts must not simply be a matter of re-enacting all current road traffic legislation into one instrument.  The benefits of consolidation are too often misunderstood and over-stated. If the project is to be of value, it will be necessary to examine each aspect of the legislation and see where it might be improved upon.  Such a project, done properly, could take up to three years to complete.</p>  <p>  There is no indication of any failure of prosecutions due to a lack of consolidation, never mind the significant problem which would need to exist to justify diverting resources from more urgent tasks to consolidation at this time.  Any decision to undertake such a project in the future will have to be balanced against the value added and the risks associated with undermining the extensive legal precedents established to date. Indeed, I understand that recent significant precedents in court decisions would suggest that consolidation should not be undertaken at this time.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Law Reform Commission has a consolidated text of each of the Road Traffic Acts from 1961 to 2014 available on its website, which along with at least one recent publication of a consolidated text of the Road Traffic Acts and related Acts, delivers on what many understand consolidation to mean.</p></reply>

It is my intention that the supports available through my Department will continue to improve conditions in these communities into the future. </p>  <p>  This can be achieved through the implementation of programmes and initiatives that facilitate and encourage economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs, and to provide other facilities that support our communities to become and remain desirable places to live, work and raise families. </p>  <p>  To help bring this about, my Department will work across Government to:</p>  <p>  - Create the conditions to support increased economic opportunities and local employment in all areas of the country</p>  <p>  - Enable communities disadvantaged by location or social issues to reach their full potential now and in the future</p>  <p>  - Deliver schemes and programmes that support the revitalisation of towns and villages</p>  <p>  - Improve  access to services and social networks that ensure a high quality of life</p>  <p>  - Support all communities to be able to have a voice in shaping their own futures and addressing their common goals</p>  <p>  My Department's budget will increase by &euro;62 million to &euro;293 million in 2019 - a 27 per cent increase on our 2018 allocation of &euro;231 million - which adds to our capacity to provide direct and indirect supports to local communities through the range of schemes and programmes delivered by my Department. </p>  <p>  These include the Dublin North East Inner City Initiative, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, LEADER programme, Community Enhancement Programme, CL&Aacute;R Programme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. My Department also provides supports for social enterprises. </p>  <p>  The increased budget allocation for Dormant Accounts will also allow continued support for excellent existing measures such as the Social Innovation Fund Ireland and funding for new measures such as supporting enterprise hubs along the Atlantic Economic Corridor. The increased funding will provide for a number of Volunteer Centres around the country and support measures under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan which address economic, social or educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  A key priority is to ensure better alignment, consolidation and integration of programmes across the Department, while we will also focus on cross-Departmental and whole-of Government approaches with a view to achieving greater impact and effectiveness in the delivery of our supports to communities.   </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development in Ireland, and Project Ireland 2040 are strategic policy initiatives that set out the ways in which Government aims to address disadvantage and how we can support both rural and urban communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is coordinated and monitored by my Department and is the most comprehensive Government plan ever produced to support economic and social development in rural areas. The measures within it are being delivered across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations over the period to 2020.  The Third Progress Report on the Action Plan is due to be published shortly and I can confirm significant progress continues to be made across the range of measures.  </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 laid out the Government&rsquo;s plans for the country&rsquo;s long-term development, and a key commitment within it regarding rural Ireland is the provision of &euro;1 billion for the new Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which will enable towns, villages and outlying rural areas to grow sustainably and support delivery of the strategic objectives of the National Planning Framework.</p>  <p>  The Fund will be a key driver in supporting the revitalisation of rural Ireland, delivering a significant and sustainable impact for rural communities and helping to address issues such as de-population in small rural towns, villages and rural areas. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with key stakeholders including local authorities, community and voluntary groups, and dedicated agencies to support job creation, attract tourism investment and to contribute to sustainable economic development in all communities throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

It is intended that this scheme will include provisions for periods of home-caring.  I launched a public consultation on this proposal earlier this year in May, which closed in early September.  The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contributions a person could avail of, the level of provision of Homecaring periods, and whether there would be a "phase-in period" for the final model.  Following examination and consideration of the submissions to the consultation, my officials will prepare proposals for the design of the new approach for consideration by the Government in due course.  Once the model is implemented, calculation of a person's pension will take into consideration all paid contributions, all credited contributions and all periods of homecaring subject to whatever limits are imposed through the implementing legislation.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the case of the acquisition or construction of apartment complexes and some housing units where there are service charges that would result in a net additional cost to the AHB, the availability payment may be set at up to 95% of market rent subject to approval.</p>  <p>  CALF is a facility, which is exclusively available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to assist them in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of homes that will be made available for social housing purposes under long term availability agreements of up to 30 years. I have no plans to amend the uses for which CALF is made available to AHBs.</p>  <p>  Cost rental makes up a very important element of housing systems in other cities but is a relatively new concept in Ireland. Therefore, in order to progress cost rental in Ireland, two cost rental pilot projects are being delivered on sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. The Emmet Road site can accommodate some 330 cost rental homes and the project is being delivered by Dublin City Council working with my Department. The Enniskerry Road site will deliver 50 cost rental homes and that project is a joint venture between two Approved Housing Bodies working with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental scheme in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot projects. With regard to the funding and financing arrangements, and delivery options, the Emmet Road project was financially appraised with the support of the National Development Finance Agency and my Department is in regular discussion with the European Investment Bank, leveraging the Bank's vast experience and knowledge in developing and supporting public housing projects in other Member States.  The invaluable learning from these pathfinder projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites. In this regard, it is open to local authorities to pursue cost rental on appropriate sites and I have encouraged them to examine this option.</p></reply>

In addition, the Housing Agency has been given the task of carrying out assessments of the loan applications on behalf of the authorities and making recommendations in respect of each application.  Each local authority must have in place a credit committee and it is a matter for the committee to make the decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the Regulations and Statutory Credit Policy, having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  In line with best practice, I have asked my Department to undertake a review of the operation of the Scheme. The review will have regard to inputs from local authorities, the Housing Agency and Housing Finance Agency, and will also take account of relevant issues raised by public representatives since the Scheme was introduced.  However, in making any recommendations in relation to the operation of the Scheme, the review will also have to respect the need to ensure that lending is undertaken on a prudential basis, so as to protect the financial interests of applicants and the local authorities.    </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of successful applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan in Co Louth, I have asked the Housing Agency to centrally compile figures on the numbers of applications it has recommended to local authorities for approval . The most recent figures, as at the end of October, indicate that the Agency had recommended 22 loan applications for approval by Louth County Council.</p></reply>

The limits applicable are related to the specific household and the rental market in the area. HAP also allows for tenants to work full-time and retain their housing support so, in many cases, people may make choices about affordability taking this into consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

In effect, the statutory certificate of compliance on completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  Previously local authorities were generally exempt from building control requirements; this general exemption was removed by the Building Control (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2015 with effect from 1 September 2015 following a review of the 2014 Regulations after 12 months of operation. As a result of this, the design and assigned certifier roles for local authority projects must be undertaken by a registered construction professional (i.e. an architect, a building surveyor or a chartered engineer), who may be an employee of a local authority or whose services may be procured by way of public tender. These inspection and certification roles are statutory obligations.</p>  <p>  In the context of public works contracts, the roles, responsibilities, functions and powers of the parties to the Contract (i.e. the Employer and the Contractor) are clearly set out. These generally include obligations under Building Regulations, Building Control Regulations, Health and Safety Legislation, appropriate supervision, quality assurance procedures, monitoring of the quality of works etc. Specific arrangements in this regard are a matter for the contracting authority (including local authorities), depending on the size, complexity and risk of the project. In this context, it should be noted that there is no statutory requirement to have a clerk of works on building developments nor is it a decision for my Department whether to appoint a clerk of works or not, as this is a matter for the contracting authority (including local authorities). </p></reply>

It is intended that the framework for these temporary modular homes will be established in December 2018.</p>  <p>  Building regulations apply to all new buildings. The exemption for temporary dwellings in the Building Regulations (Class 10 in the Third Schedule of Building Regulations) is not seen to extend to the type of temporary homes envisaged under this programme and, as such, a dispensation or relaxation of the Building Regulations may be required. However, the specification set out in the request for tender represents the minimum standards in the temporary/portable home sector and is similar to British Standards and other industry standard requirements for the manufacture of such units.

The earliest date a HAP payment will be payable to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service for HAP on behalf of all local authorities. This HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages all HAP-related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month. </p>  <p>  A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient. However, on 1 January 2016, the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo; as a new discriminatory ground. This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited. Further information is available at www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/i-have-an-issue-with-a-service/i-have-an-issue-about-accommodation/.</p>  <p>  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission; further information is available on the Commission's website, www.workplacerelations.ie.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the case raised, the day-to-day operation of the HAP scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority and I am precluded by legislation from becoming involved in individual cases.</p></reply>

Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown by rigorous scientific investigations that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the (ecological) integrity of the site.</p>  <p>  If it can be demonstrated that turf cutting within a proposed location in a special area of conservation would not impact on the integrity of a European site, the appropriate consent would then be required from the relevant public authority.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Plan and in my reply to Question No. 1216 of 6 November last, the site referred to in the Deputy's Question is one of the sites being examined as regards the potential for domestic turf cutting on the site in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. The initial phase of scientific investigations on the site, undertaken by contractors engaged by my Department, was completed in November 2017. These investigations illustrated that a further specialised examination of the bog was required because of the hydrological and topographic complexities of this particular site. The results of this examination, undertaken this year, mean that it has not been possible to rule out, beyond reasonable scientific doubt, the threat of peat failure (bog burst) if turf cutting resumes in the south of the bog, as required by article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  Consequently, a final phase of concentrated geophysical and hydrological investigations is scheduled to be carried out in early 2019 to assess the level of risk of peat failure in the proposed domestic turf cutting area in the south of the site.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will keep the group, referred to in the Deputy's Question, informed of developments, when these investigations are completed and the results of same are made known to the Department.</p></reply>

The Government  also authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  </p><p>The overall aim  of the Government decision in relation to the proposed transfer of the RT&Eacute; NSO is to enable the orchestra to be established as a world class orchestra which would, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that would greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public.</p><p>In addition, the Government&rsquo;s <b>Creative Ireland</b>programme commits to a range of important initiatives to support culture and creativity in Ireland, and the Department's 10 year National Development Plan, envisages major capital investment in our National Cultural Institutions, including a major re-development of the National Concert Hall. The National Concert Hall since it opened its doors in 1981 has been the home of the National Symphony Orchestra which provides the backbone to the Hall&rsquo;s orchestral music programme. There is now an opportunity for the NSO to play an even stronger role as part of these wider developments and this should greatly enhance the offering of both organisations to the public.</p><p>An Oversight Group has been established with formal terms of reference, with a view to identifying and addressing the relevant issues to enable the successful transfer of the NSO from the remit of RT&Eacute; to the remit of the NCH. The group has already met on two occasions.  The group has agreed that a specific Engagement &amp;amp; Communication process will be put in place to provide relevant, timely information and engagement opportunities for all key stakeholders including the members of the NSO, in advance of and during this transition from RTE to NCH. </p><p>In addition, a Working Group, as a subset of the oversight group, has been tasked with examining the detailed issues involved in the proposed transfer of the orchestra.</p><p>At this point, it is considered that 2020 would be the earliest date for the completion of the proposed transfer. </p><p>My Department welcomes the opportunity to work with all stakeholders including the members of the  RT&Eacute; NSO to ensure that it can contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage to the fullest extent possible.</p></reply>
