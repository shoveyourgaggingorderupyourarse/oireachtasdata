    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-08a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070800080#WRA00600"><p>By late 2019 there was considerable concern at the pace of progress in relation to the proposals of the TUSEI consortium comprising IT Carlow and Waterford IT to establish a technological university (TU). The South East is the only region in the country without a university presence. Addressing this situation has been a priority objective for the Department not just in educational terms but because of its wider significance in accelerating regional development..</p>  <p>  In this context the Department encouraged the TUSEI consortium to work effectively to achieve TU designation including through the establishment of appropriate governance structures. The Department&rsquo;s considered view was there was a persuasive case to be made, based on previous successful TU applications in Dublin and Munster, for securing the services of a programme executive director with a strong mandate under the joint governance structures put in place by the consortium. The creation of a project-specific senior executive leadership role, either a person or team of high standing operating across both institutions, would accelerate project momentum and, crucially, expedite the TU application. This person or persons would be ceded sufficient devolved authority from the institutions&rsquo; governing bodies to speak authoritatively on its progress, manage and deliver the finalised application, and lead project delivery in advance of any legal establishment of the TU and recruitment of its leadership team.</p>  <p>  The consortium proceeded to explore the possibilities of such a role in early 2020, keeping the Department informed of developments. I understand the consortium compiled a specification for the role of programme executive director and then drew up shortlists of potentially suitable individuals. In this regard the consortium was supported by the Department in engaging with a number of experienced senior leaders, mainly in the university sector, to sound out whether there would be interest in the role. This did not yield a successful outcome with none of these candidates the person subsequently appointed to the role by the consortium. </p>  <p>  In July 2020 the consortium ultimately appointed Mr. Tom Boland, a former and long-serving Chief Executive of the HEA who is highly regarded within the Irish higher education sector with significant experience and expertise in higher education, to the role of programme executive director.</p>  <p>  The Department was advised of the proposed appointment and agreed that it would meet the requirements identified for independent senior executive leadership to accelerate the delivery of the TUSEI project.  A project that up to that point had been ongoing for some nine years. </p>  <p>  Given the importance attaching to the establishment of a TU in the South East in the Programme for Government, as Minister I welcomed Mr. Boland&rsquo;s appointment on 28 July 2020 having briefed the Cabinet on the advancement of the TUSEI consortium proposals, including this appointment, on 22 July. </p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt my Department, while supportive of the TUSEI consortium in the manner outlined, did not hold responsibility for the process of appointment and the agreement of contractual arrangements, as the consortium was the contracting party for the services of the programme executive director. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the project has achieved very significant progress with the Governing Bodies of IT Carlow and Waterford IT submitting their joint TU application on April 30th and arrangements underway for this application to be considered by an international expert advisory panel as provided for in the Technological Universities Act 2018.</p></reply>

While apprenticeships are national programmes, it is the pattern of employer recruitment of apprentices that determines the availability of individual apprentice opportunities.  </p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are available in many sectors that have a strong regional presence such as manufacturing, hospitality, construction, and retail.   The continued expansion of the apprenticeship system into new sectors of the economy such as agriculture and horticulture, together with the opportunity of online and blended learning, will bring real opportunities for learners and employers throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  Objectives such as balanced regional development will inform the manner in which the education and training system can support employers in planning and addressing their skills requirements. This is why a survey undertaken by the Regional Skills Fora Managers of 340 SMEs across the country formed part of the consultation process for the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021.  </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship, the new National Apprenticeship Office will drive promotional activities to heighten public awareness and that of employers of the range of apprenticeship offerings throughout the country. Visibility of programmes will be supported through the national Generation Apprenticeship campaign and continued engagement with regional vocational skills showcases.  The Regional Skills Fora, with their in-depth knowledge of the local and regional landscape, will support the National Apprenticeship Office to ensure that there is a strong regional focus to the future development of apprenticeships.   Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship prospective apprentices from all geographical locations will be able to find out information about apprenticeship opportunities and will receive more support and clearer communication throughout their entire learning journey.</p></reply>

The application is seeking an order under section 36 of the Act for the applicant institutes to be dissolved and the establishment of a technological university (TU). On 25 May 2021 in accordance with my obligations as Minister under section 31(3) of the Act, I appointed an advisory panel of four persons to assess the application.</p>  <p>  This experienced and expert international panel, whom I met late last month as a matter of courtesy, is the same panel that assessed the application for TU designation made by the Athlone and Limerick Institutes of Technology in late 2020.  In meeting with the panel my officials also took the opportunity to emphasise the continuing Government and Department support and commitment to the creation and development of TUs in Ireland in line with the 2019 TURN report. I pointed out that Government has allocated significant Exchequer funding for TU progression under the Transformation Fund. This support reflects the priority regional objectives of higher education access, research expansion, skills creation and retention and regional development including for the South-East region.</p>  <p>  Department officials understand that the  panel commenced its virtual assessment interactions with the applicant institutes on Monday this week 5 July 2021. </p>  <p>  I await the furnishing of the panel&rsquo;s report, the views of the Higher Education Authority on it, and any other information the Authority considers relevant in accordance with the timeframes prescribed under the 2018 Act before making my proposed decision on the application. </p></reply>

This urgency reflected the essential contribution to the preparation of an application for TU designation of such a role, and the priority that the Minister and Government afforded to the establishment of a TU for the South East in light of broader national and regional strategic objectives.</p>  <p>  The Department was advised of the proposed appointment and agreed that it would meet the urgent requirements which the Department and institution Presidents had identified for independent senior executive leadership to accelerate the delivery of the TUSEI project, that up to that point had been ongoing for some 9 years. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the appointment process and agreeing the specific contractual arrangements were matters for the TUSEI consortium.  The Department did recognise that urgency and the specific requirements of the role were relevant in finalising this temporary, project-specific appointment.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I welcomed the appointment of Mr. Tom Boland as the TUSEI consortium programme executive director on 28 July 2020 in the context of the importance Government attaches to the establishment of a TU in the South East. The successful submission of a joint application for TU status by the Governing Bodies of the two institutions in April underscores the importance of the work undertaken.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-08a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070800080#WRA02100"><p>Youthreach is one of a broad suite of 34 Further Education and Training (FET) programmes that are currently funded through the FET System Funding process. This process is essentially a full cost model where each programme initially receives a set amount of funding commensurate to the estimated costs of delivery. Ultimately, the funding provided corresponds to the full costs of delivery. </p>  <p>  A review of the funding model operated by SOLAS for FET is currently underway. The proposed alternative funding model, which is being considered by SOLAS for all FET provision, seeks to align available funding directly with learner activity by apportioning it with regard to the previous year&rsquo;s completion returns.  The model aims to improve upon the existing funding system by reflecting both the unique nature and characteristics of different types of FET provision and the learner outcomes that are produced.  In this respect, it is important to emphasise that this would not be a Youthreach funding model but rather a FET funding model. The envisaged benefits of such an approach include increases in transparency, efficiency and value for money.</p>  <p>  The funding review is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached with regard to the funding of Youthreach or any other aspect of FET provision. The future funding approach for Youthreach will reflect its particular characteristics and the intensive learner support required in its delivery &ndash; it is not planned to fund Youthreach on the basis of number of students completing the programme with QQI certification. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is a priority for my Department that the final funding model adopted will ensure that the Youthreach programme maintains the crucial contribution it makes to providing a safe, structured and supportive environment of learning for early school leavers.</p></reply>

The intention of the scheme is to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery following COVID-19. </p><p>The Scheme was initially approved under the July Jobs Stimulus for employers registering apprentices after the 1<sup>st</sup>March 2020.  It had been anticipated that the initial duration and subsequent expansion of the Scheme to mid-2021 would cover the re-opening period.  However this has not transpired meaning that employers have not had the opportunity to avail of the benefits of the Scheme to the extent envisaged during the re-opening phase.  </p><p>I have provided for the extension of the scheme on two occasions and the scheme will now include all apprentices registered to the end of this year.  Employers are sent an electronic application form once they have registered an apprentice.As of 1<sup>st</sup>July employers will be requested to confirm that they have advertised the apprentice role on www.apprenticeshipjobs.ie or else provide a rationale why they have not advertised the post.  </p><p>The scheme has supported a significant recovery of apprentice registrations in 2020 and into 2021 and has enabled apprentice registrations to remain on a par with registrations for 2019.  By end May 2021 there were 2,296 new registrations compared to 1,493 at end May 2020 and 2,329 by end May 2019.</p><p>Since the launch of the Scheme, payments in respect of 4,307 apprentice registrations have been made to date with a current spend of &euro;8.614m. </p><p>The establishment, funding and success of the scheme is a strong demonstration of my and the Government's commitment to the development and growth of apprenticeship in Ireland, which will be sustained and intensified through the implementation of the Action Plan on Apprenticeship.  </p></reply>

All proposals made in relation to higher education expenditure, including student grants for the 2021/22 academic year, are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.  </p>  <p>  I secured approval in Budget 2021 to enhance postgraduate grant supports from this September. This year the postgraduate fee grant will increase from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants will increase from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240. This is an initial step in implementing the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support. In addition an extra &euro;20m is being made available to meet additional demands on the SUSI scheme due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. To take forward this commitment I established a review of the Student Grant Scheme. This review is currently underway, and being conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants, under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising a number of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy, including in the context of forthcoming Estimates process for 2022. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p></reply>

I am very pleased to see that a progress review of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education which was published in December 2018 showed considerable progress amongst those with disabilities. The target of 8% that was set for the lifetime of the Plan was exceeded with a new target of 12% set for 2021. Current data shows the percentage of full-time new entrants in higher education with a disability is 12.3% (2019/2020). </p>  <p>  The process for the appointment of Governing Authority members of the Universities, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities is set out in the Universities Act, 1997; the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992-2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018 respectively.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Universities Act and the Technological Universities Act I, as Minister, am not involved in the process of appointments to the Governing Authorities of Universities or TUs, other than to provide the requisite number of Ministerial nominees as set out in the respective legislation. With regard to the Ministerial nominees onto Governing Authorities, my Department undertakes an open recruitment process and liaises with the relevant institution to identify any gaps in particular competencies or experiences that would be beneficial to the Governing Authority. The position with regard to the further education colleges is that it is the relevant Educational Training Board that is responsible for the appointment of the boards of management.</p>  <p>  As part of the reform of the Higher Education Authority Act, it is planned to amend the Universities Act, 1997, the Technological Universities Act, 2018 and the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 to provide that universities, technological universities and institutes of technology will be required to consult with relevant persons and bodies when developing their strategic development plan and equality policy. This consultation will include students, employees and any other appropriate bodies or persons thus ensuring that the perspective and views of people with disabilities are encompassed within strategic development plans and equality policies. It is also envisaged that the legislation with revise the membership and appointment processes to Governing Authorities, including to achieve smaller, competency based Governing Authorities that have regard to the diversity of communities served.</p>  <p>  The reformed legislation also includes a provision that the HEA can issue policies, codes and guidelines to designated higher education institutions, including any policies, codes and guidelines related to disability issues. The institutions will be required to report to the HEA on a regular basis on the implementation of these policies, codes and guidelines.</p></reply>

This new Strategy will provide a framework to build on and streamline the substantial work that is already being done across a range of Government departments, state agencies and wider stakeholder groups, to increase awareness of services for the public and to capture the contribution that can be made right across Government to deliver better literacy, numeracy and digital literacy in the adult population. The framework being provided through this new Strategy will also embed the use of literacy friendly provision and plain language to ensure the most accessible public, civil and business services throughout the country. The aim of this new Strategy will be to ensure that everyone has the literacy, numeracy and digital literacy to meet their needs and participate fully in society. </p>  <p>  A detailed and extensive research and consultation process was carried out to guide and inform the preparation of the Strategy.  The work completed during this process assembled a substantial evidence base that has shaped the content of this strategy. The process was fully inclusive, gathering the insight and expertise of over 2,000 individuals and organisations who contributed to the development process.</p>  <p>  The Strategy was approved by Government on 6th July 2021, with a view to publication and launch by the end of this month.</p></reply>

Continued investment in skills and human capital development delivered by the further and higher education system is critical to sustainable employment creation on a balanced regional basis.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the labour market and skills effects of the pandemic, a range of measures were introduced as a response to upskilling and reskilling needs of individuals and businesses through the July Jobs Stimulus and Budget 2021. These measures are providing 35,000 education and training places to help those who were displaced by the effects of the pandemic. A further 15,000 places were announced as part of the skills package in Budget 2021. Combined these measures include places on the Skills to Complete initiative, additional places through Skillnet supported programmes, funding of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation scheme, the roll-out of retrofit training across the country and the expansion of the range of short-duration, part-time and online upskilling and reskilling offerings available for recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p>  <p>  Education and Training Boards (ETBs) plan their further education and training  provision every year with the submission of quantitative and qualitative data through the SOLAS funding allocation system, taking into account the needs of Learners, Enterprise and Communities in their area.</p>  <p>  A key strength of the apprenticeship model, as highlighted in the recent Action Plan for Apprenticeship, is that it is a demand-led approach to meeting workforce and skill requirements in our economy.  For example in the case of craft apprenticeship, the number of places is determined by employers, with off-the-job training provided to all registered apprentices.  Apprenticeships established since 2016 have one or more intakes per annum with the take-up determined by employer engagement and available apprentice jobs provided by employers. </p>  <p>  The detailed and comprehensive Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 launched on 19th April last sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. </p>  <p>  Government is committed under the Action Plan to working with employers to promote, enable and support the recruitment of apprentices.  Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of the target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025.  These measures encompass both financial and non-financial and will include an annual grant for employers not benefiting from the existing mechanism of State-funded craft apprentice training allowances for off-the-job training. This employer grant will be administered by the new National Apprenticeship Office and the level of grant will be announced by year end. </p>  <p>  In the meantime the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been extended and the scheme will now include all apprentices registered to the end of this year to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery at the reopening of the economy following COVID-19.  The Scheme comprises a &euro;2,000 payment when employers register a new apprentice, followed by an additional &euro;1,000 payment one year later where that apprentice is retained.  </p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the reference period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  The PUP payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. This is a well-established procedure.</p>  <p>  As per Article 22(5)(b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, income from an applicant&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period, subject to a maximum of &euro;4,500, can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed. This holiday earnings disregard under the Student Grant Scheme can only be applied to income from employment earned by the student in the manner described. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that restrictions were eased during the summer months and the Christmas period of 2020 which enabled many students to return to work. Those students, who engaged in work during non-term times when restrictions were eased in 2020, can avail of the holiday earnings provision and have that income excluded from their reckonable income up to the value of &euro;4,500 for the 2021/22 grant scheme.</p></reply>

All proposals made in relation to higher education expenditure, including student grants, are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports from next year including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants to increase from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240. This is an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme.  It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme 2021 contains a number of qualifying thresholds for various grant values. These gradations allow students just over a threshold margin, to remain in receipt of a grant, albeit at a reduced rate that reflects their relative income vis-&agrave;-vis other applicants.  </p>  <p>  The scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home. There are also provisions for a number of income disregards which are not counted as reckonable income for the student grant means test.</p>  <p>  Particular priority is afforded to those on the lowest incomes and social welfare dependents through the special rate of grant, which is payable at the higher non-adjacent rate of &euro;5,915 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,375, depending on the distance travelled to the college attended.</p>  <p>  Separately, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their higher education studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the higher education institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p></reply>

However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). </p>  <p>  Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports.

On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is overseeing the implementation of the review. A Steering Committee has been established to provide direction for the external consultants undertaking the review.

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.    </p>  <p>  The report referred to in the Deputy's question was commissioned under the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme in November 2019. The independent consultants appointed by the Commission - Indecon and LE Europe - were required under the terms of reference to undertake a detailed review of the three specific funding options contained in the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education. </p>  <p>  The consultants were also tasked by the Commission with examining the steps necessary to adapt higher education and further education and training provision in Ireland to ensure an alignment between graduate  output and qualifications and the current and expected future skills need of the Irish labour market, to provide the country with the right set of skills to ensure inclusive, smart and sustainable growth. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference agreed by the Commission also required the consultants to identify options for putting in place a new funding system for higher education in Ireland that would provide equity in access, efficiency in the investment of public resources and sustainability in the face of strong demographic growth. </p>  <p>  The final deliverable arising from the project was submitted to the European Commission recently. Following its completion my Department has commenced its examination of the report's analysis, findings, conclusions and recommendations in order to develop proposals for Government to seek to meet the commitment contained in its Statement of Strategy.  Once this examination is concluded the report will be submitted to Government for consideration in advance of its publication.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, important to acknowledge that in the five years from 2015 a very significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Over that period current public expenditure allocated to the higher education sector has increased by in excess of half a billion euros or almost 40 per cent.  In 2021 total planned current expenditure funding of the higher education sector exclusive of research provision is in the order of &euro;1.98 billion.</p>  <p>  This huge allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector in order to more fully realise its potential in contributing to economic and societal priorities which are central to this country's long-term sustainability. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we grasp the opportunity provided by the comprehensive and detailed work which has now been completed in relation to this crucial issue and take the actions necessary to increase the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland.  This will require a commitment to change and transformation across both higher education and the whole of the tertiary education system.  I am confident that all stakeholders are ready to step up to this vital challenge.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (COVID-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the COVID-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the COVID-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. This is a well-established procedure. </p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The Progress Review noted rates of participation by mature students had declined since the commencement of National Plan for Equity of Access 2015-2021. Participation rates for mature students fell from 13% to 9% for full-time students, and by 3% for full and part-time students. This coincided with a period of economic recovery and labour market reactivation unforeseen when the targets for the NAP were being set; this may have been a factor in the declining number of mature students.</p><p>The 2018 Progress Review recommended that research into participation by mature students be commissioned to examine factors, including challenges and barriers. The HEA commissioned Indecon International Research Economists to provide an independent study on mature student participation in higher education.</p><p>The report was recently published and can be accessed on the HEA&rsquo;s website at: hea.ie/resource-category/access/publications/</p><p>The report provides a crucial insight into the challenges faced by the mature student population (current, former and prospective) in accessing and participating in higher education. Among its recommendations, the report calls for access targets and supports to be focused on disadvantaged communities as well as expanding opportunities for part-time learning. It calls for strong national provision of guidance and support for mature students as well as increasing provision for foundation/provision of bridging courses in partnership with further education, and the development of seamless pathways between further education and training and higher education.  </p><p>The publication of this report in June is timely as it coincides with the consultation process on the next National Access Plan (NAP) which will cover the 2022-2026 period. Its findings and recommendations will input into the development of the next NAP and provide an evidence base for more effective targeting and tailoring of actions to support disadvantaged communities to enter higher education as mature students.

From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge need to be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential. The centrality of the higher education and research systems in the innovation ecosystem and the availability of high-quality talent from the tertiary education system are core to Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position.  </p>  <p>  The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career. The higher and further education sectors are critical sources of knowledge creation, innovation, skills and human capital development and critical to our ability to deal with current and future crises is ensuring we have a pipeline of talent coming through our higher education system that is fully equipped to make a valuable contribution to our economy and society. </p>  <p>  I and my department are determined to be the driver of a vibrant sector which produces individuals who are equipped with the skills that they need to progress in the way that they want to, and in a way that meets the needs of our evolving economy and contributes to an inclusive society. Not only will these individuals be equipped with expertise in research and innovation but I am also determined that the sector will continue to embrace and embed innovation in how it delivers and operates.</p>  <p>  As international competition for talent, investment and innovation grows more intense as nations strive to improve their standing as knowledge based economies, the establishment of a new Department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society. </p></reply>

Therefore neither I nor my Department have a function in relation to such matters and it is not within my remit to determine admissions criteria or direct HEIs to give preference to certain students.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups, or students with results from different years.</p>  <p>  Last year more than 2,250 additional places were provided in order to offset the particular pressures faced by the system. My Department is monitoring the situation this year as it develops and my officials are working with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where there is scope for additional places to be provided. All bodies involved will continue to work to ensure the availability of a full range of options for applicants in 2021.</p>  <p>  &euro;18 million has been provided in Budget 2021 which will build additional capacity in the system and address demographic growth pressures. This is in addition to additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year, which will depend on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants.</p>  <p>  In addition to higher education, there is a range of options available in further education and training and apprenticeships. These options can serve both as an alternate pathway to a chosen career or an alternate pathway into higher education.

Institutions and providers will continue to put in place plans to ensure that the overall number of people on campus at a given time continues to be moderated.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning, in the event of a more restrictive public health environment, is also being prepared by the sector. However even in a more restrictive public health environment, it is envisaged that there will still be significant on-site activities. At a very minimum, workshops, tutorials, classroom based activities and smaller lectures will be allowed and libraries, research facilities and labs will be opened.</p>  <p>  While vaccination rollout continues to accelerate across age cohorts, the challenges associated with the unpredictability of the virus remain, particularly in light of the emergence of new variants of the virus. Nevertheless, the sector is committed to maximising onsite provision for students and learners for September 2021 and on that basis and in line with the Safe Return Plan, institutions and providers are currently progressing their own detailed planning and work for a comprehensive return to on-site activity.</p>  <p>  I have undertaken to provide an update to Government in mid-July on this planning and the associated expected level of on-site activity in further and higher education and research in the Autumn. This will ensure that there is ongoing support for planning in this sector and that planning proceeds in a manner that is aligned to prevailing public health advice.</p>  <p>  Following the update to Cabinet in July and taking account of public health guidelines, it is envisaged that institutions and providers will be in a position to communicate their plans for a return to on-site activity to students, learners and staff.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for SUSI to determine. For the 2021/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (COVID-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the COVID-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the COVID-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. This is a well-established procedure. </p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The CAO process applications for undergraduate, and some postgraduate, courses on their behalf. </p>  <p>  Decisions on admissions, including in relation to deferrals, are made by the higher education institutions who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Therefore information on deferrals is held by the HEIs and the CAO, not my Department and I do not have access to the information requested. Typically the number of deferrals on any course is limited by the HEI in question.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that a total of 632 CAO offers, 595 of which are for Level 8 courses, have been made to students whose results in the 2020 written Leaving Certificate examinations brought them into consideration for a higher preference offer, based on their 2020 CAO application. These students will have the option to take up these offers for the 2021 academic year. While the offers have already been confirmed to students, they will be formally made as part of CAO Round A, which takes place in July. These offers represent a very small proportion of the offers to be made in 2021. In 2020 a total of 96,426 CAO offers were made overall, of which 58,895 were for Level 8 courses.</p>  <p>  My officials have been working with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where there is scope for additional places to be provided. In addition to higher education, I would like to highlight the range of options available in further education and training and apprenticeships. These options can serve both as an alternate pathway to a chosen career or an alternate pathway into higher education. For students who are not successful in gaining an offer for their course of choice in the first instance, there are alternate routes available to them to reach their preferred option.</p></reply>

Legislation is being progressed which will restrict the up-front payments required to secure accommodation, including student accommodation, to no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent, and limit payments thereafter to on month&rsquo;s rent at a time. At present this legislation is passing through the Oireachtas, and it is intended for it to be enacted in time for the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  This legislation was discussed with stakeholders in the sector at most recent meeting of the Working Group on Student Accommodation, and affordability will continue to be one of the key topics of discussion in future meetings.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien TD, has also recently received Government approval for the reform and extension of the Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) model.

As soon as possible after the enactment of the Residential Tenancies (No.2) Bill 2021, changes to the method of calculating permissible rent increases (if any) in RPZs, will be brought into effect.

The scheme was initially approved under the July Jobs Stimulus and extended in Budget 2021 for apprentices registering between March 2020 and June 2021.  </p>  <p>The intention of the scheme is to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery at the reopening of the economy following COVID-19.  It had been anticipated that the initial duration and subsequent expansion of the scheme to mid-2021 would cover the re-opening period, however this has not transpired meaning that employers have not had the opportunity to avail of the scheme and re-opening is only now happening in a significant way in the period to year end. On the 23rd   June the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science announced the expansion of the scheme to include apprentices registered in the second half of 2021.  </p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are employer led demand driven educational and training programmes, which aim to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.  As apprentices are employees the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employer base in any area or sector. Take-up of the incentivisation scheme is therefore similarly demand led.</p>  <p>  3,197 apprentices have been registered to date in 2021.  Applications to the AIS have been made in respect of 2,225 apprentices (70%).   It is anticipated that there will be in the region of 6,450 apprentice registrations in 2021, all of which are eligible to apply under the incentivisation scheme.</p>  <p>  It is not anticipated that the AIS will be extended beyond 2021. Actions set out under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 will see employers of apprentices other than the 25 craft apprenticeships become eligible for an annual base grant paid per apprentice from early 2022. The level of grant will be announced by year end.  Employers of craft apprentices benefit from the direct payment of training allowances by ETBs to apprentices during their three periods of off-the-job training (phases 2, 4 and 6 of a seven phase craft apprenticeship).  This will continue for the 25 apprenticeships which are currently covered under this process. </p></reply>

The application is seeking an order under section 36 of the Act for the applicant institutes to be dissolved and the establishment of a technological university (TU). On 25 May 2021 in accordance with my obligations as Minister under section 31(3) of the Act, I appointed an advisory panel of four persons to assess the application.</p>  <p>  This experienced and expert international panel, whom I met late last month as a matter of courtesy, is the same panel that assessed the application for TU designation made by the Athlone and Limerick Institutes of Technology in late 2020.  </p>  <p>  Department officials understand that the  panel commenced its virtual assessment interactions with the applicant institutes on Monday this week 5 July 2021. </p>  <p>  I await the furnishing of the panel&rsquo;s report, the views of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on it, and any other information the Authority considers relevant in accordance with the timeframes prescribed under the 2018 Act before making my proposed decision on the application. </p>  <p>  In relation to finances, since 2013 the TUSEI consortium has received &euro;8.8 million to advance its proposals for TU designation. This includes an allocation of &euro;5.1 million in October 2020 under the Transformation Fund. The HEA, which administers the fund on behalf of the Department, is currently in discussions with TUs and TU development consortia on 2022 allocations.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to capital investment in the proposed technological university for the South East. Officials from the Department and the HEA are in ongoing engagement with both Institutes in relation to campus development plans across all proposed TU locations, including Wexford. It is planned that over the lifetime of the National Development Plan substantial investment will be required across various locations to address under investment in facilities. This investment includes the vision of a larger campus footprint in the South East, including in Waterford, and the provision of fit for purpose spaces to address skills and demographic demand issues. </p></reply>

However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme.

This new Department has been established with a clear mandate to work with all stakeholders to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;I ecosystem, drive reform and collaboration, and enhance outcomes which contribute to meeting societal, economic and global challenges.</p><p>This new strategy will aim to be transformative in meeting these challenges. It will identify the reforms necessary to develop an R&amp;amp;I system that has the right capacity and capabilities, and which is supported by coherent policies and structures for national coordination, collaboration and governance across the national R&amp;amp;I landscape. </p><p>My officials are currently seeking submissions via a public consultation which was launched last month, and will close this Friday 9th July. There is a Consultation Paper on my Department&rsquo;s website which reflects many of the main issues that have emerged in early consultations with key stakeholders. It also reflects the clear intent at EU level that R&amp;amp;I will help our societies recover from the pandemic and prepare Europe for the challenges of the coming decade and beyond. </p><p>Last week, my Department held an online stakeholder event where a wide range of stakeholders from across Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;I system came together to discuss the issues raised in the consultation paper and inform the strategy.</p><p>The strategy will build on the lessons of delivering the previous national strategy, <i>Innovation 2020</i>. The overarching vision in Innovation 2020, was for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society. Within this was a focus on excellence, talent and impact. The Mid-term Review of Innovation 2020 found that, while it has been challenging to meet some of the key targets of <i>Innovation 2020</i>, much progress has been made and the overall vision of becoming a Global Innovation Leader remains valid. While renewed targets will need to be identified and agreed during the development of the next strategy, the Government&rsquo;s ambition for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader has not diminished.</p><p>Consultation is ongoing, but it is the intention that the next strategy will set a vision and ambition for Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;I system that all relevant actors will identify with and contribute to, with ambitious national strategic goals and objectives out to 2027. Action-led Work Programmes will map out specific deliverables over shorter timescales. This will enable agility and responsiveness over the full period of the strategy and a strong focus on delivery and reform.</p><p>I  intend bringing the strategy to Government for approval later this year.</p></reply>

The result of that intensive collaboration was the finalisation of a comprehensive plan for returning with significant increases in onsite tertiary education in the autumn.</p>  <p>  Following this period of consultation with sectoral stakeholders and with Government approval, I published A Safe Return: Plan for a safe return to on-site Further and Higher Education and Research in 2021/22.</p>  <p>  The Plan reflects the essential nature of higher and further education and training, and research activities, and in that context provides for comprehensive on-site activity for the next academic year, with almost full scale on-site activities. Institutions and providers in the sector have committed to ensuring that all learners across all areas have significant scheduled on-site learning in the forthcoming year.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement and collaboration with the higher and further education sector via the Covid-19 Tertiary Education Sector steering group whose membership includes both sectoral and stakeholder representatives.  There is also ongoing engagement via the stakeholder fora:  the Partnership of Stakeholders in the Technological Sector (POSITS); and the Further Education Stakeholder Forum.</p>  <p>  The partnership and collaboration demonstrated by all stakeholders, institutions and educational providers, their staff and representative bodies, students and learners has been instrumental in developing the plan for the safe return to onsite provision of higher and further education.  The continuation and intensification of this approach will be central to its successful implementation.   </p>  <p>  I will provide an update on this planning to Cabinet in July and following that update, and any wider development with regard to public health, it is envisaged that institutions and providers will be in a position to communicate their plans for a return to on-site activity to students, learners and staff.</p></reply>

The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.  </p>  <p>  The Plan will address the clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people of all ages, be they progressing in their career, school leavers or career changers. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Currently over 28% of the apprenticeship population are over 25 years of age and in some of the new consortia led apprenticeships such as Auctioneering and property service the over 25 cohort rises to 70%.</p>  <p>  A new National Apprenticeship Office will make accessing information on, and engagement with, apprenticeship more straightforward for both learners and employers.  It will provide practical advice and support for the new consortia responsible for the delivery of apprenticeships at programme level. Prospective apprentices of all ages will be able to find out information about apprenticeship opportunities and will receive more support and clearer communication throughout their entire learning journey, including exploring the opportunity for craft apprentices to express preferences on the location of their off-the-job training, where practicable. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship the impacts of, and outcomes from, existing access to apprenticeship and pre apprenticeship programmes as well as other interventions across the sector will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions to deliver an apprentice population which better reflects the general population. </p>  <p>  Enhanced cooperation with the State's Public Employment Service as set out in the Plan will also increase visibility of apprenticeship to employers and career changers.</p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs. </p>  <p>  A range of supports and measures are in place for learners with disabilities; some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student populace. The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  Circa 75,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each institution who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  Circa &euro;40m is allocated annually to higher education institutions (HEIs), through their core funding, in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups to access and successfully complete higher education.</p>  <p>  Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports, the Deputy will be aware of the range of additional supports that were put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's COVID response last year. These included: additional supports for access measures in higher education; a mitigating educational disadvantage fund for further education and training; a student laptop scheme; a once off grant of &euro;250 for students; additional funding for student mental health and wellbeing; and Dormant Accounts Funding for Traveller access to and progress within higher education. </p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2016-2021 (NAP) has set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.3% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declaring a disability.</p>  <p>  While there is significant provision for students with intellectual disabilities in the further education and training sector where there were 2,821 learners with intellectual disabilities in 2019 and some provision in the higher education sector involving a comparatively small number of learners. I have asked my officials to engage with the HEA and SOLAS to see where we can play a stronger role, in meeting the educational needs of this group as part of a coherent whole of Government responses. We are at an early stage of work in this area, but it is an area I am strongly committed to pursuing.</p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy (FET) 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including persons with a disability, members of the Traveller and Roma communities, migrants and the unemployed, with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that the apprenticeship population reflects the general population is a stated aim of the Government in both the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.  Targets for participation by under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups will be set in conjunction with the Equity of Access Subcommittee (of the National Apprenticeship Alliance)  and will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions are working and that we are delivering greater diversity across the apprentice population.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential.</p></reply>

This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.</p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme.

The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025 across all sectors of the economy including construction. Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of that target. </p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme, the number of apprentice placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 to 3,499 in 2019. The impact of Covid-19 and the closure of the construction sector in March 2020 impacted heavily on apprentice registrations in the first half of 2020. Registrations recovered in the second half of the year with the support of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, which provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 payable over two years to support employers who take on and retain apprentices, reaching a total of 3,104 registrations on construction related apprenticeships by year end.  This trend in continuing into 2021 and there were 1,346 registrations on construction related apprenticeships to end of May 2021 compared to 953 in 2020 and 1,491 in 2019. The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been extended and the scheme will now include all apprentices registered to the end of this year. The intention of the scheme is to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery at the reopening of the economy following COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, a new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) will drive central branding and promotional activities targeted to heighten public awareness of the range of apprenticeship offerings in all sectors including construction. Visibility of programmes will be supported through the national Generation Apprenticeship campaign and continued engagement with regional vocational skills showcases.</p>  <p>  Prospective apprentices will be able to find out information about apprenticeship opportunities and will receive more support and clearer communication throughout their entire learning journey, including exploring the opportunity for craft apprentices to express preferences on the location of their off-the-job training, where practicable.</p>  <p>  They will be encouraged to provide their views on the functioning and development of the apprenticeship system, by appropriate representation within stakeholder advisory bodies and by means of an annual survey of apprentices to be carried out by a new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) as part of the data collection and evaluation framework. An apprentice bursary scheme will be established to fund up to 100 apprentices per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage. </p>  <p>  Education and training relevant to skills needs in the construction sector is delivered through ongoing apprenticeship and non-apprenticeship further and higher education and training as well as through specific activation programmes such as Springboard, the Human Capital Initiative and Skillnet Ireland. </p>  <p>  Among the 61 apprenticeships currently available at levels 5-10 on the National Framework of qualifications, the 25 traditional craft apprenticeships at level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications have been supplemented by new apprenticeships in geo-drilling (Level 6), with programmes in scaffolding (level 5), roofing and cladding (level 5) and advanced quantity surveying (Level 9) due to launch in 2021. </p>  <p>  By 2025 apprenticeship will be a clear choice for people looking for a new career, qualification or return to work option across all sectors of the economy including construction and employers will see the value and benefit of apprenticeship in meeting the skills requirements of their workforce.</p></reply>

Following Government approval, last month I published A Safe Return: Plan for a safe return to on-site Further and Higher Education and Research in 2021/22.</p>  <p>  The Plan reflects the essential nature of higher and further education and training, and research activities, and in that context, provides for comprehensive on-site activity for the next academic year, with almost full scale on-site activities. In addition, contingency planning, based on a more restrictive public health environment, is also being prepared by the sector. Even in a more restrictive public health environment, it is envisaged that there would still be significant on-site activities. </p>  <p>  At a very minimum, workshops, tutorials, classroom based activities and smaller lectures will be allowed and libraries, research facilities and labs will be opened. The safety measures which will be in place such as social distancing, face masks, ventilation will be in accordance with prevailing public health advice taking into account the essential nature of further and higher education and research. Institutions and providers will continue to put in place plans to ensure that the overall number of people on campus at a given time continues to be moderated.</p>  <p>  The intention of Government is to strengthen the prevention and intervention measures around COVID-19. The potential role of rapid antigen testing as one part of a package of measures to support greater on-site provision is recognised, particularly in the context of the recent publication of the COVID-19 National Protocol for Employers and Workers, which notes rapid antigen testing as a possible way of strengthening COVID-19 responses and providing reassurance to staff and others.</p>  <p>  An SFI-backed multi-site pilot study to examine rapid testing for third level students and staff in Ireland has commenced.  It is expected that the study will provide learning on the potential role rapid antigen testing can play. Pilot projects are underway in four universities &ndash; NUI Galway, UCC, UCD and Trinity College Dublin.</p>  <p>  Should the pilot study demonstrate the effectiveness of rapid testing as a tool, it would play a role as one part of a wider vigilance programme that could include self-monitoring in addition to other public health non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>  <p>  My Department has also joined a HSE-led Pilot Project Working Group to pilot approaches for the operation of rapid testing in education settings, including third level. </p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken to provide Government in mid-July with an update of the progress in relation to sectoral planning and the expected level of on-site activity in further and higher education and research in the Autumn, including an update on planning with regard to large scale lectures. This will ensure that there is ongoing support for planning in this sector and that planning proceeds in a manner that is aligned to prevailing public health advice.</p>  <p>  Following the update to Cabinet in July and in anticipation, at that point, of revised public health guidelines being available, it is envisaged that institutions and providers will be in a position to communicate their plans for a return to on-site activity to students, learners and staff.</p></reply>

This will include planning for orientation, re-orientation and transitions programmes to assist students in familiarising or re-familiarising themselves with the on-site environment and learning resources.

The Safe Return Plan can be accessed here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/bcd91-a-safe-return-to-on-site-further-and-higher-education-and-research/ </p>  <p>  The Plan reflects the essential nature of higher and further education and training, and research activities, and in that context, provides for comprehensive on-site activity for the next academic year, with almost full scale on-site activities, utilising a Discretionary Framework with a more expansive definition of necessary on-site activities. In addition, contingency planning, based on a more restrictive public health environment, is also being prepared by the sector. Even in a more restrictive public health environment, it is envisaged that there would still be significant on-site activities. </p>  <p>  To support the Plan, the sector has developed a Pact of actions and commitments to ensure that the return is safe. Under this Pact, institutions and providers are committing to making provisions for the needs of vulnerable and high-risk staff, students and learners where vaccination is medically contraindicated. More details on the sectoral pact are available in section 5 of the Plan.</p>  <p>  Institutions and providers are currently progressing their own detailed planning and work for a comprehensive return to on-site activity, and students and learners who cannot avail of the vaccine should engage with their institution or provider directly, as they are best placed to provide information on their plans for the new academic year.</p></reply>

In 2020 I secured additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs) which was in addition to the &euro;2m funding allocated in Budget 2020. </p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) requested HEIs distribute this funding in support of specific student engagement, such as the recruitment of additional student counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year. This Framework provides clear guidance to HEIs regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties.</p><p>The HEA continually monitors the way the financial supports operate within the institutions. In institutional progress reports, institutions have reported that the funding has supported the recruitment of student counsellors, and has enabled support of additional roles, such as Assistant Psychologists and Mental Health Advisors. </p><p>Funding is also assisting with extending available hours of service and has supported agility within the HEIs in their collective responses to the challenges created by the ongoing pandemic among the student cohort. Increased capacity has created significant activity in outreach to students, including:</p><p>- online support groups (anxiety support, mood management);</p><p>- open, drop in groups to support connection/reduce isolation and loneliness;</p><p>- groups specifically targeting international students, 1st year students and postgraduates;</p><p>- workshops on resilience; managing fear/anxiety/uncertainty; grief and loss during the pandemic; motivation/staying engaged with college;</p><p>- increased responsiveness from counselling services, with many providing same day Wellbeing Calls or brief consultation calls, to respond to students quickly and provide &quot;right time&quot; care;</p><p>- delivery of institution wide staff training in identifying, responding to, and referring, distressed students.</p><p>The HEA is expecting receipt of detailed reports from the higher education institutions on their use of funds provided in 2020 later this month, and an update will be provided to my department thereafter.</p></reply>

Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p><p>Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians is provided, can candidates who are under 23 be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address, Article 21(3) (b) of the Scheme refers. </p><p>The assessment of a case of estrangement is carefully considered to ensure there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances pertaining in such cases genuinely exists. Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and almost always will involve exceptional circumstances unique to a particular family situation. The scheme does not stipulate precisely how an awarding authority satisfies itself that such circumstances prevail. This is to allow the awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess the evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each individual case. The type of documentary evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances. </p><p>Accepted evidence to support an application can include a letter from a Social Worker/TUSLA confirming a students' estrangement or a Court Order. Other documents may be provided but must specifically confirm the estrangement. All documents submitted are subject to review by SUSI to determine if the estrangement criteria has been met.  </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie  </p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

The date in prospect is 1 October 2021. The order was approved in the D&aacute;il on 7 July 2021 and is scheduled for consideration by the Seanad on 12 July 2021.</p><p>My officials are informed that in 2020/2021 there are 96 students registered on the Limerick IT Ennis Campus in County Clare. As the new TU is not yet established currently it has no registered students on the Ennis campus. Limerick IT staffing on the Ennis campus are understood to vary from semester to semester. Depending on the number of students who are off campus on work placement, the academic staffing may vary between 5-7 WTE. The number of professional, management and support staff is 1.5 WTE.</p><p>The plans and proposals, mission and values of any specific TU are matters for the governing body of the higher education institution in question.  </p><p>However, the Deputy may obtain an understanding of the ambition for the new  TU in the application for TU designation of Athlone and Limerick Institutes of Technology which I approved  on 5 May and which is publicly available on the website of the Higher Education Authority at:</p><p>In addition, Section 9 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 prescribes the many and varied functions required of all TUs legislatively. </p><p>It will be a matter for the governing body of the new TU to fulfil its functions under the Act, a number of which relate to regional development and community interaction, and to pursue relevant missions that facilitate delivery of these functions across the university&rsquo;s multi-campuses including in Ennis in concert with the university&rsquo;s staff and students, external regional stakeholders and wider community interests.</p><p>The communities in areas where there are campuses of the new TU, including at Ennis will, over time, benefit from the university attracting more students, the retention and creation of skills and employment in its regional hinterlands and acting as a catalyst for research, innovation and enterprise with a view to attracting increasing levels of investment including Foreign Direct Investment and to contributing to further regional and socio-economic development.  </p><p>Both Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan reiterate the pivotal role of Higher Education in regional development, enabling deep collaboration between industry and other employers and the Tertiary Education and Skills system through, for example, shared objectives for applied research and innovation in strategic sectors of the regional and national economy. Future Jobs Ireland strongly endorses the role of TUs to drive the development of regional clusters with a particular focus on innovation, technology and SMEs. </p><p>Government has invested heavily in the TU agenda to date with over &euro;65 million invested through higher education landscape and transformation funding since 2013.  The TU Transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million in total to 2023 with &euro;34.3 million having been allocated in its first tranche last October. In total, over &euro;120 million will have been invested in TU development and progression by 2023. </p><p>I am strongly committed to appropriate capital investment to underpin the ambitions of our higher education institutions including TUs.

This initiative which enabled a bulk purchase of approximately 16,500 laptops on behalf of higher education institutions is intended to help address concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning, and the importance of supporting disadvantaged students to adapt to these new models of learning.</p>  <p>  The delivery through the National Broadband Plan of high-speed internet connectively nationwide will ultimately provide a solution to current differences in broadband experience for students and learners. In the interim there are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. It is also worth noting that, at the present time HEAnet provides a wi-fi solution - EduRoam - designed by and for the higher education community which operates across the education locations nationally. EduRoam allows a student to access wi-fi wherever EduRoam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one EduRoam location to another.</p>  <p>  HEAnet has extended the reach of EduRoam beyond the traditional campus locations to areas within the wider community. The extended EduRoam footprint greatly overcomes connectivity challenges and facilitates staff and students in effective teaching and learning activities. </p>  <p>  In addition, on 11 May 2021, I launched a new project, &ldquo;Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together&rdquo;, aimed at building an informed vision for the future of teaching and learning in Ireland, co-ordinated by the National Forum and funded through its Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund. Digitalisation has been identified as a strategic challenge across all areas of government within the National Development Plan and higher education has an evolving digital transformation agenda which has been impacted by the recent shift to online/remote teaching and learning. This project will inform upcoming strategic developments at national level as well as being of practical benefit to members of the wider higher education community, and involves a collective consideration of what was known about enhanced teaching and learning across face-to-face, blended and online/remote contexts prior to the pandemic, as well as what we know so far about what has been learned from the experience of the shift to fully online/remote learning since 2020. It is planned that findings and recommendations from this project will be published at a national launch due to take place on 10 November 2021.</p></reply>

Many of these have grown due to proximity while others have been facilitated through various EU instruments including the PEACE and Horizon programmes.   </p>  <p>  The Special EU Programmes Body is currently drafting the next iteration of PEACE PLUS, which will be submitted in due course to the EU Commission for approval.  Officials in my  Department and the Department of the Economy are currently working together to identify possible actions to address policies such as skills acquisition, and this will in due course offer new opportunities for Further and Higher Education Institutions to deepen collaborative actions in this area.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the UK have confirmed their intention to continue their participation in the Horizon programme, and this will similarly offer opportunities for higher education and research institutions to develop additional opportunities to cooperate.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the Government, through the Shared Island Initative, is determined to create a positive context for greater North-South collaboration.

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and performance, and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.    </p>  <p>  The report referred to in the Deputy's question was commissioned under the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme in November 2019. The independent consultants appointed by the Commission - Indecon and LE Europe - were required under the terms of reference to undertake a detailed review of the three specific funding options contained in the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education. </p>  <p>  The consultants were also tasked by the Commission with examining the steps necessary to adapt higher education and further education and training provision in Ireland to ensure an alignment between graduate  output and qualifications and the current and expected future skills need of the Irish labour market, to provide the country with the right set of skills to ensure inclusive, smart and sustainable growth. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference agreed by the Commission also required the consultants to identify options for putting in place a new funding system for higher education in Ireland that would provide equity in access, efficiency in the investment of public resources and sustainability in the face of strong demographic growth. </p>  <p>  The final deliverable arising from the project was submitted to the European Commission recently. Following its completion my Department has commenced its examination of the report's analysis, findings, conclusions and recommendations in order to develop proposals for Government to seek to meet the commitment contained in its Statement of Strategy.  Once this examination is concluded the report will be submitted to Government for consideration in advance of its publication.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, important to acknowledge that in the five years from 2015 a very significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Over that period current public expenditure allocated to the higher education sector has increased by in excess of half a billion euros or almost 40 per cent.  In 2021 total planned current expenditure funding of the higher education sector exclusive of research provision is in the order of &euro;1.98 billion.</p>  <p>  This huge allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector in order to more fully realise its potential in contributing to economic and societal priorities which are central to this country's long-term sustainability. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we grasp the opportunity provided by the comprehensive and detailed work which has now been completed in relation to this crucial issue and take the actions necessary to increase the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland.  This will require a commitment to change and transformation across both higher education and the whole of the tertiary education system.  I am confident that all stakeholders are ready to step up to this vital challenge.</p></reply>

This has enabled sustained, ongoing recruitment. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation. This includes the deployment of Garda&iacute;. Neither I nor Minister Humphreys have any role in these independent functions. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I further understand that it is a matter for the divisional officer, that is, the Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those officers who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 31 May 2021, there are 72 designated Community Garda&iacute; in the Tipperary Division, including 67 at Garda rank and five sergeants.</p><p>However, it is vital to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic. This is also fundamental to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which are currently being implemented through <i>A Policing Service for Our Future</i>, including the adoption of the new Garda operating model.</p></reply>

In this context, the Deputy will be aware that my Department brought forward the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2021.  </p>  <p>  In 2018 a working group was established to examine the issues raised in a report from the Law Reform Commission on Jury Service. </p>  <p>  In its report the LRC identified a number of issues, such as how representative juries are of their communities, the wide range of people who can be excused as of right from jury service; the difficulties that arise in complex lengthy trials for members of a jury; provision of reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities to serve as jurors; the implications of on-line internet activity and wireless technology for the work and conduct of juries; and issues of remuneration arising from jury service. </p>  <p>  The group comprised officials of my Department, the Courts Service, Forensic Science Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand it met and engaged in targeted consultation with other key stakeholders on a number of occasions between April 2018 and April 2019, at which stage other important work took priority.  I am informed that, apart from the time of the group's members, no additional costs were incurred.   </p>  <p>  The intention is that the operation of the jury system will be reviewed, taking account of the work already carried out by the working group and any subsequent developments, particularly over the course of the pandemic, with that review commencing next year. I do not expect the previous group to be reconvened to produce a report.  Any measures identified in the review would also build on the other important reforms to jury service I have mentioned and would likely require primary legislation. Actions will be considered in the context of developing Justice Plan 2022. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that there is strong, visible community policing right across Ireland, both rural and urban.  </p><p>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided very dedicated service to assisting in the national effort to combat the threat of COVID-19, ordinary policing has of course also continued throughout the period.</p><p>This includes the winter phase of Operation Thor, which ran from 1 October 2020 until the end of March 2021. Operation Thor is designed to tackle the increase in the number of burglaries and associated criminal activity that usually occur in winter months by undertaking targeted enforcement and preventative activity highlighted through public information campaigns including 'Lock up, Light up' etc. These initiatives have been successful in dramatically reducing the rate of winter burglaries, leading to a significant decline in property-related crime since its introduction in 2015.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware of the National Rural Safety Forum, which brings together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and?the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development, alongside national and local organisations including the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the GAA. The purpose of the Forum is to develop a nationwide network for the distribution of crime prevention advice, increase engagement within communities, and prevent and reduce opportunities for crime.? My Department's Justice Plan 2021 commits to working with the Forum to develop initiatives to promote community safety and to reduce the opportunity for crime throughout the country. </p><p>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposing new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. A subgroup of this Forum has already examined the issue of misuse of scramblers and quadbikes and this work has informed the development of a new scheme aimed at tackling this issue in local areas.</p><p>My Department also provides funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re, which is a member of the forum on antisocial behaviour, to cover costs incurred by communities in administering the Text Alert Scheme with funding of &euro;200,000 in place this year.  <b></b></p><p>Finally, last week An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy - Operation Tara which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. </p></reply>

These numbers have been consistent across recent years.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the introduction of a new Garda operating model is a key recommendation in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, published in September 2018, and is to be rolled out under its implementation plan, <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>.  Under the new model, all services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level, to allow greater specialisation and to release Garda&iacute; from back office functions, and Garda districts will no longer form part of the organisational structure. </p><p>I am advised that, under the operating model, there will continue to be three superintendents assigned to the Kerry Division, each heading a different functional area.  One superintendent will be assigned to community engagement, a detective superintendent will lead crime investigation, and one superintendent will be responsible for performance assurance. Senior management in the Kerry Division has been also been strengthened by the assignment of an assistant principal officer who has responsibility for leading the business services area.  </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, change is never easy and I do not underestimate the amount of disruption and unease that change on this scale will bring but I am confident that, as envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing, the adoption of this new policing model will strengthen the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the people of Kerry and other Divisions around the country.  </p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to managing their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection obligations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties and I am happy to confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. If the Deputy is aware of any groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 38(3) (c)) and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements are in place since 2006.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. When enacted, this legislation will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></reply>

These include education, employment, work training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and chaplaincy services which are intended to provide purposeful activity and to encourage and equip individuals to lead law-abiding lives on release. I am pleased to say that these services are available in all prisons.</p>  <p>  The current Irish Prison Service three year Strategic Plan commits to continuing and expanding these supports, including a increased use of digital technologies. </p>  <p>  Education in prisons is delivered with a focus on providing a service which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. To this end broad and flexible options are offered, ranging from basic literacy training right up to third level courses.</p>  <p>  In addition, a wide range of work and training services are available. Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym. Accredited courses have been expanded with City and Guilds and the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and with Cleanpass to ensure a wide range of certified training is provided. </p>  <p>  In terms of education participation figures, I am advised that 31.8% (or 1,192 persons) of the average prison population engaged in education activities in the month of February 2017. </p>  <p>  In 2018 these figures were 40.6% (or 1,161 persons) and the figure was 42.4% (or 1,325 persons) in February 2020. </p>  <p>  While this was rising encouragingly year on year, the impact of COVID over the past year has unfortunately seen this fall to just over 25% (or 957 persons) of the average prison population in May 2021.  As the Deputy will appreciate, classroom-based activity has been severely constrained during Covid. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the numbers who applied for Open University Courses was up.  71 students were funded by the Prison Service to participate in Open University courses in 2020, a significant increase on the average number of 50 students per year prior to that. </p>  <p>  Nearly 20% (or 708 persons) of the average prison population engaged in vocational training in April 2021. This figure was 22% (or 838 persons) in February 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Prison Service, in partnership with the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, assists sentenced prisoners to identify their job and education readiness and to prepare them for release. In 2019, the Association received 806 referrals and a further 414 in 2020. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to note that the &lsquo;Working to Change&rsquo; Social Enterprise and Employment Strategy, which was launched in November 2020, further increases employment options for people. It encompasses actions under three pillars: social enterprise, employment, and self-employment. It sets out 46 actions and ambitious targets and is overseen by a Steering Committee which is representative of the criminal justice sector as well as other relevant Departments and Agencies. One important action in the Strategy under the general employment stream, commits to working with industry experts to ensure employment focused training and up-skilling measures, offered throughout criminal justice agencies, are responsive and aligned to the identified skills gaps within the labour market. </p>  <p>  Connected to this Strategy, the Deputy will also be aware of the ongoing work within my Department to reform our spent convictions legislation. Under the Justice Plan 2021, my Department is working to take forward the Programme for Government commitment to review the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 to broaden the range of convictions that are considered spent. I believe that this work will greatly assist and offer opportunities to individuals who have demonstrated that they wish to move away from offending and into employment by offering them an important &lsquo;second chance&rsquo;.</p></reply>

My Department has continued to accept and process applications throughout the pandemic.  However, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions and from a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed. </p>  <p>  As a result, regrettably, there are just over 24,600 applications currently on hand at various stages of processing. </p>  <p>  Since opening the statutory declaration system in January, we have invited 6,500 applicants to complete the final steps prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. Almost 3,900 people have received their certificates so far. Approximately 900 more will receive them in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. These measures will free up staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, improving customer service and reducing waiting times. Based on current staff resources, the decision making timeframe is expected to revert to 6-9 months during 2022. </p>  <p>  In normal circumstances, passports are returned to applicants approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on the numbers of staff attending the office due to public health restrictions, has resulted in some delays in this. My Department has recently advised customers not to submit passports with their applications between 25 June and 30 September if they think that they will need to travel during this time.  This will also allow the citizenship team to prioritise the processing of applications during the summer months.  Where passports have already been submitted and are now needed for urgent reasons, such as medical reasons or to sit medical exams, applicants can contact the citizenship team to request their return.  I can assure the Deputy that all requests of this nature will be dealt with promptly.  </p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  With specific regard to additional supports being provided for existing schemes, the Deputy may wish to note that the scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties and I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. This bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. When enacted, this legislation will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will understand, the proportion of applications for involuntary detention reflects the unfortunate reality that Garda&iacute; often encounter persons with severe mental health issues and will be called upon by members of the public or indeed family members where a person is experiencing high levels of distress.  Very often, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the first available frontline service to whom people will turn in such situations. </p>  <p>  I know that an application for involuntary detention is never made lightly and takes full account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&lsquo;s obligation to protect the human rights and welfare of individuals and communities. The only statutory option available to Garda&iacute; responding to persons in a mental health crisis and potentially posing a risk of harm to themselves or others is to invoke Section 12 of the Mental Health Act, 2001.  Section 12 requires Garda&iacute; to take the person into custody in order to have them assessed by a registered medical practitioner. </p>  <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland stated that societal-wide issues such as the mental health of individuals are not the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone. The Commission recommended the establishment of multi-agency teams that would include Garda&iacute; to respond to the needs of individuals with mental health issues. A pilot mental health crisis intervention team is being prepared in Limerick Garda Division. This pilot project is being progressed in close collaboration with the HSE and it is hoped to begin the rollout of the pilot team early next year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing legislation to amend the Mental Health Acts 2001-2018. This legislation will update powers relating to involuntary detention by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will provide for a code of practice on the powers of Garda&iacute; under the Act to be introduced. I understand that the draft heads of this legislation have been drafted following consultation with key stakeholders, including mental health experts, the Mental Health Commission and the public.</p>  <p>  The issue of mental health is a priority area for me and the Department of Justice.  The Deputy may be aware of the newly established high level Task Force established by Minister Helen McEntee in April this year.  Kathleen Lynch, former Minister of State for Primary Care, Mental Health and Disability was appointed as independent chair. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Taskforce is further to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure the critical mental health needs for people interacting with the criminal justice system are met in order to ensure improved outcomes for individuals and society and is a key goal of the Justice Plan 2021. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce has met twice and set up a number of subgroups to consider the complex cross government and agency issues involved including how An Garda Sioch&aacute;na could implement a diversion policy for use in suitable cases. The Taskforce will report to the Minister for Justice and Minister for Health on progress by the end of September and will publish a high level implementation plant by the end of this year.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, this is kept under review subject to a number of critical factors including the risk of the Delta variant, the need to maintain infection control measures and impact on staffing of this, the roll out of the prison vaccination programme for both prisoners and staff, as well as the community vaccination programme.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service is currently developing a new Framework for the Unwinding of Prison Restrictions, informed by the recent Government Plan for reopening our society, set out in<i>Resilience and Recovery: The Path Ahead.  </i></p><p>I am pleased to report that a full prison vaccination programme commenced on 9th June on a prison by prison basis. Vaccinations are being administered by the National Ambulance Service, supported by Prison Service health care teams to all prisoners, and unvaccinated staff under 40 years of age. While the schedule is agreed with the HSE it is subject to change and outside the control of the Prison Service.</p><p>In line with the vaccination schedule, physical visits to prisons will recommence on a phased prison by prison basis with visits resuming 7 days after prisoners have been fully vaccinated.  Therefore, in line with the envisaged completion on the vaccination programme as currently set out, the IPS hopes to be able to recommence physical visits in Wheatfield Prison on 14 July.</p><p>I am advised that, in line with the vaccination schedule, it is expected that visits will have recommenced in eight prisons by the end of July with visits returning to the remaining four locations in August and September. </p><p>However, it is also important to note that this will be subject to consideration of infection and hospitalisation levels in the community, given the increased concern surrounding the Delta variant.  </p><p>The operation and frequency of visits will be kept under ongoing review, guided by HSE and Public Health advice as well as a desire to support as much contact as possible between prisoners and their families.</p><p>Finally, I can advise the Deputy that the video visit system which was introduced in 2020 has proven very successful and when physical visits recommence, the Prison Service will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners.  </p><p>Detailed information for families in relation to the operation of visits and booking system is available on the Irish Prison Service website .</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  </p><p>However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.

The Government is very conscious of the dangers presented by knife crime, and indeed all violent assaults. Clearly any stabbing has the potential to cause irreparable physical harm and tragic consequences and the Government is determined to ensure that similar problems to those which have developed in neighbouring jurisdictions do not develop here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Justice Plan 2021 contains a commitment to review Garda powers in relation to dangerous weapons, including knives, to ensure they have the necessary legal tools to protect our communities. My Department are also analysing existing data, as well as developing new sources of data, and looking at international best practice to inform policy in this area.</p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and Commissioner Harris, who met earlier this year on the issue, also agreed that further analysis is needed to provide greater insights into the level of violent incidents in society. My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will remain in contact on the issue and will also engage with colleagues in public health on the matter.</p>  <p>  I am planning to establish a subgroup of the Anti-Social Behaviour Forum, which I chair, to examine knife crime issues and to develop proposals for practical measures, including community-based programmes, and for consideration of legislative amendments, if deemed appropriate and necessary.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's &lsquo;Use your brain, not your fists&rsquo; campaign highlights the dangers and consequences of any assault to both the victim and the attacker. The Garda Commissioner established Operation Soteria to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of assault within communities, prioritise assault investigations, and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. The Operation includes targeting knife crimes in areas where it is shown to be relevant and necessary.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone. It will be best achieved as a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together. </p>  <p>  To this end, Local Community Safety Partnerships will be established in each local authority area which will draw up local Community Safety Plans to address issues of concern in their local area. This may include consideration of issues such as that raised by the Deputy. Three pilot projects are currently being established and will run for the next two years in Dublin's north inner city, Waterford and Longford ahead of a national rollout.</p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection considerations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open for applications from all counties. 34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties and I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. Further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 38(3)(c)) and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework sets out a number of safeguards, requiring that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have operated since 2006.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. This bill will also cover CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner.  I intend to conduct a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems.  When enacted, this legislation will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></reply>

This falls significantly below the high standards that the public expect from the Garda&iacute; and the high standards that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na set for themselves. I am particularly concerned that anyone experiencing domestic abuse, and indeed anyone in a vulnerable position, who summoned the courage to seek assistance may not have received it.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the apology that has been made by the Garda Commissioner and the Commissioner has assured me that when someone calls 999 now, they can expect and trust that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will help. That should always be the case. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Policing Authority was asked by Minister McEntee to oversee the review being carried by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to this matter, and there have been a number of engagements between the Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since March of this year.  This is of course in keeping with the role of the Authority in providing independent oversight of policing services, and reporting on and advising the Minister of the day.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Commissioner met with the Policing Authority in public last month, where he gave a detailed account of these serious shortcomings and outlined what steps have been taken by Garda management to ensure it does not happen again. I understand he will be meeting the Authority again later this month.   </p>  <p>  It is vital that the best interests of victims and anyone whose calls were cancelled inappropriately are the priority and focus throughout this process. The Commissioner has informed me that Garda&iacute; are currently contacting people whose 999 calls were cancelled in order to apologise and ask if they require help from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He has briefed me a number of times on the matter and he has assured me that this work will be completed quickly and that once that process is complete, he will give a full account to the Policing Authority.</p>  <p>  When the Authority has completed its work and reported to me, I will examine its conclusions and take any action warranted on foot of its report.</p></reply>

I can confirm it is open to GSOC to make wider systemic recommendations on issues they investigate and they are free to do that in this instance also.  </p>  <p>  As GSOC is statutorily independent in its operation and administration, it would not be appropriate for me as Minister to comment on or interfere in what is an ongoing independent investigation with full powers. I am confident however that GSOC is treating this matter with the utmost priority and with the gravity that it deserves.  It is important for the family and all those involved in this tragedy that the investigation is done thoroughly but as speedily as possible in the circumstances.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Minister McEntee met with the Nkencho family in April to hear from them directly.  She assured them of GSOC's independence and that they are the most appropriate body to complete a full, impartial investigation into all of the circumstances relating to the death of Mr Nkencho.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot discuss this matter in detail given the ongoing investigation.</p></reply>

We asked each NGO to identify the precise categories of victims they work with, the services they provide and the geographical areas they work in. The funding available increased from &euro;2m in 2020 to &euro;4m this year.  We have allocated most of the 2021 grant money, but are still analysing the data to see where gaps remain so we can work to fill those. We are also offering multi-annual funding commitments to those NGOs we work most closely with and where the funding covers staff salaries. This is to promote more sustainable service delivery and planning. These grants cover court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, emotional support, counselling and referral to other services.</p><p>COVID-19 has allowed the Courts Service to move forward several years in terms of use and acceptance of a virtual courtroom platform, and to develop positive engagement models with many of its stakeholders. This includes 49 new or upgraded video Courtrooms being provided throughout 2021. This has positive implications for vulnerable witnesses and victims in the courtroom setting. There is &euro;8m set aside for a court modernisation programme</p><p>As I mentioned, we are also working with our NGO partners and others to map the journey faced by individual victims to identify issues and support needs not met. The working group leading on this task has met and the NGOs have presented us with a considerable amount of data, which is currently being analysed. When this analysis is complete, the group will reconvene to identify and agree actions to be taken to meet those needs.</p><p>Another group is working on the development of an approach to meeting training needs of a wide range of front-line staff and professionals, including legal professionals. My Department is in the process of engaging a consultant to conduct a mapping exercise of specialised training, to identify existing provision and where additional training provision is required.</p><p>A third subgroup is looking at developing a framework for the operation and training of intermediaries. We have partnered with the University of Limerick on this. The O&rsquo;Malley Review commits to the introduction of intermediaries who will assist in the communication process, whether between lawyers and witnesses during trial or, earlier, during Garda interviews. Their use will be rolled out on a pilot basis initially, one in Dublin and one in another part of the country.  </p><p>Last year the Department of Justice published a new and expanded Victims Charter. The updated charter takes account of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which sets out the rights of victims of crime, and seeks to assist victims of crime in locating services available to them. The charter was developed by my Department in consultation with all relevant State agencies and organisations including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, the DPP, as well a wide range of non-governmental organisations and groups representing victims themselves. </p><p>The charter sets out information on the services offered by the State as well as voluntary groups who work with victims of crime. The charter also outlines out how to get in touch with relevant services and what supports the various services can offer to victims of crime. Significantly, the charter describes the criminal justice system from the perspective of a victim of crime, so that victims can understand what to expect from their interaction with the system. </p><p>Earlier this year, Minister McEntee launched a redesigned Victims Charter website, Victimscharter.ie. The website brings together all of the information a victim of crime might need to know about their rights and about what to expect from their engagement with the criminal justice system. It also provides details of all the different supports that are available both when engaging with the criminal justice system and more generally.  It presents the information in an easily accessible and user-friendly way that will allow victims of crime to quickly and easily find the information they need.</p><p>My Department is planning a campaign to raise awareness of the rights provided in the Victims of Crime Act 2017. This will include printed materials and social media messaging around a wide range of topics such as how to make a report and what to expect if you are called to be a witness in a trial, what happens when the trial is over, etc. The printed material will be translated into Irish and a number of other languages widely-used in Ireland, and will focus on making people aware of the Victims Charter and the rights afforded to people when they become a victim of a crime.</p><p>I am confident that these initiatives will ensure that when victims of crime begin to engage with the criminal justice system, they will know what to expect, what their legally enforceable rights are, and the supports available at every step in the process.</p><p>Finally, on the legislative side, the Criminal Procedures Bill, which introduces preliminary trial hearings for the first time in Irish law, was signed into law recently. Benefits will include making it less likely the jury will be sent away during the trial to allow the judge to hear legal arguments and reducing the impact on the victim who will have prepared themselves mentally, only to be met with delays.</p></reply>

The Justice Plan 2021 identifies the enactment of legislation to licence and regulate the gambling industry as a key objective. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme of the Bill in Q3 2021, and will seek Government approval for the drafting of the Bill on that basis. My Department is targeting some key milestones in the year ahead. In addition to the publication of the general scheme, it is intended to finalise the appointment of a CEO designate by the end of the year. This is the clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023.   </p>  <p>  While a General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill was published in 2013, a considerable amount of further work has been done in the meantime. The Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling reported in 2019 and a European Commission funded report on the structure of a gambling regulator was produced in late 2019. The task now is to bring all three elements together, and having regard to the on-going evolution of the gambling industry, into one coherent scheme of a Bill that will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task.  </p></reply>

The cross-border Joint Agency Task Force (JATF) was established under the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to bring a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime. The Task Force is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue, the PSNI and HM Revenue and Customs. The Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Crime Agency are also involved as needed in operational activity. </p>  <p>  Tackling drug related crime by disrupting criminal groups and targeting their money is among the top priorities for the JATF.  At a recent meeting with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Justice Minister Naomi Long on 26 May, we were briefed by officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI who updated us on the work of the Task Force.  They highlighted the practical value in the continuing high level of co-operation and operational activity between the agencies in tackling drug crime, as well as rural crime, financial crime, trafficking in human beings including children, excise fraud, and organised immigration crime.   </p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that on 10 June, the two police services announced a number of arrests and the seizure of significant quantities of controlled substances and cash, arising from the work of the JATF. </p>  <p>  The JATF is just one element of the excellent ongoing co-operation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI in respect of the full range of policing activities. A joint Cross Border Policing Strategy covers the range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged.</p>  <p>  An example of the close cooperation between the two jurisdictions is the Cross-Border Seminar on Organised Crime. This is an annual event organised jointly by the two Justice Departments and the two police services which focuses on co-operation and best practice in countering organised crime that seeks to exploit the border. The most recent seminar was organised as a webinar event on 17 December 2020 due to the public health restrictions.   </p>  <p>  I am assured by Garda authorities that the long established and close working relationship with the PSNI remains central in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s efforts to providing an effective policing service to the border area and its communities.</p>  <p>  It is also noteworthy that last week, on 1 July, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated Operation Tara, an enhanced national anti-drugs operation, with a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing in cities, towns and villages across the country based on intelligence and the latest crime trends.</p>  <p>  This, together with the other operations, will continue to play a crucial role in the all-island efforts to tackle the detrimental impact of drug related crime and I would like to express my appreciation to all the frontline officers involved for their ongoing work.   </p></reply>

It does this by making prevention of harm, protection of people who are vulnerable or at risk, and the safety of communities a whole of government responsibility.<b></b></p><p>In order to achieve this, innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships will be established which will replace and build upon the existing joint policing committees and provide a forum for State agencies and local communities to work together. The model is built on the principle that the community needs to be central in identifying what it needs and helping to shape solutions. To achieve this, each partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by the communities themselves.</p><p>In November 2020, Minister McEntee announced the establishment of three Partnerships on a pilot basis, which will run for the next two years in Waterford, Longford and the north inner city of Dublin. </p><p>Independent chairpersons have now been appointed to each pilot Partnership, and I am very pleased that Martina Moloney, with her strong background in local government and governance, has agreed to chair the Longford pilot. Engagement with community groups has been taking place and further community engagement activities are planned. It is intended that the Longford Local Community Safety Pilot will be established in September. </p><p>As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the national rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that Minister McEntee and Minister McGrath have agreed, in principle, to establish a new Community Safety Innovation Fund. The scheme, when established, will allocate funds to community safety projects and other policy initiatives in the area including the work of the Local Community Safety Partnerships.</p></reply>

In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Judge is completely independent in conducting this scoping exercise. It is not open to me as Minister to comment on any aspect of the Judge's work or the process of compiling the final report. My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. </p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton has written to my Department this week indicating that there are some minor matters to be addressed in relation to one aspect of the inquiry. Once those matters have been addressed, he intends to seek comments and/or corrections on that aspect of the draft report from interested parties, including the O&rsquo;Farrell family. Following receipt of responses from these parties, Judge Haughton will be in a position to finalise his report. My Department will continue to provide all necessary assistance to Judge Haughton, and I look forward to receiving his final report in due course and to updating the House in this matter.</p></reply>

However, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and it has not been possible to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. </p>  <p>  This has further exacerbated significant delays which arose from a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Unfortunately that resulted in the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time, before the appeal resolved the issue.</p>  <p>  This accumulated delay in 2019 combined with the impact of the pandemic since March 2020 means that, regrettably, there are just over 24,600 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2021, my Department opened a temporary system to enable applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. I am glad to say that almost 3,900 people have received their certificates so far and approximately 900 more have returned their documentation and will be receiving their certificates in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process. This includes the introduction of eTax clearance and eVetting; rolling out online payments; revising the immigration website to make it more accessible and user friendly for customers; and launching the first chatbot &lsquo;Tara&rsquo;, which has answered more than 30,000 customer queries since last November. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

The Government is very conscious of the dangers presented by knife crime, and indeed all violent assaults. Clearly any stabbing has the potential to cause irreparable physical harm and tragic consequences and the Government is determined to ensure that similar problems to those which have developed in neighbouring jurisdictions do not develop here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Justice Plan 2021 commits to reviewing Garda powers in relation to dangerous weapons, including knives, to ensure they have the necessary legal tools to protect our communities. My Department is also analysing existing data, as well as developing new sources of data, and looking at international best practice to inform policy in this area.</p>  <p>  I have also proposed that a subgroup of the Anti-Social Behaviour Forum (which I chair) should be established to examine knife crime issues and to develop proposals for practical measures, including community-based programmes, and for legislative amendments, if deemed appropriate and necessary.</p>  <p>  While I understand the objective of conducting an amnesty in the face of very tragic incidents involving the use of knives, the consistent expert advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that such an amnesty is not likely to yield any significant benefits. Indeed it is well understood that, in many instances, ordinary household/kitchen knives are used in such crimes and it has not been the experience that knives of this type are handed in during any amnesty. Similarly, the type of firearms handed in during a firearms amnesty are not the type of firearms generally used in violent gun attacks and consequently, an amnesty would have little effect on such activity.</p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and Commissioner Harris, who met earlier this year on the issue, also agreed that further analysis is needed to provide greater insights into the level of violent incidents in society. My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will remain in contact on the issue and will also engage with colleagues in public health on the matter.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Scoping Report was to gather and assess information relating to ongoing challenges and community needs in Drogheda, and to identify actions to support communities and connect relevant services. The report comprehensively addresses the ongoing challenges and needs experienced by communities in Drogheda and identifies opportunities to connect, support and strengthen services in the area. </p>  <p>  The publication of the Scoping Report and the development of an implementation plan are key actions in my Department's Justice Plan 2021. A distinguished former Director of the Probation Service, Vivian Geiran, was engaged to prepare the report, which makes over 70 recommendations on short and long term responses to challenges the community faces. This includes measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development. The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to resource public services or provide additional services in certain areas in particular.  </p>  <p>  The Scoping Report was published on 26 March last. Briefings were organised by Minister McEntee the following week for community groups and services that had met with Vivian Geiran, as well as for public representatives for Louth.</p>  <p>  The implementation plan for the key recommendations arising from the report is currently being developed and will identify the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outline next steps for engagement. </p>  <p>  An action plan to oversee the implementation of all of the recommendations contained in the Geiran report is at an advanced stage of preparation and is expected to be published in the coming weeks. I look forward to continuing engagement with all relevant Departments, agencies and the Louth local authority to ensure a comprehensive and practical approach to implementation.</p>  <p>  As well as publishing the scoping report, my Department has identified some actions for early implementation which can be progressed in line with the finalisation of the implementation plan. This includes providing funding to the Red Door project and the Family Addiction Network. </p>  <p>  Grant funding is provided for specified projects in line with grant agreements.  Red Door have submitted grant proposals and my officials are engaging with them to conclude grant agreements to oversee the proposed projects. </p></reply>

This is a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking, and those forced to provide sexual services.</p>  <p>  The expungement has not yet taken place because in order to do so, legislative amendments need to be drafted and advanced.</p>  <p>  It is generally recognised that prostitution is inherently exploitative of vulnerable persons, mainly women and girls, and that many people are forced into prostitution through trafficking, drug addiction, homelessness and poverty. It has not been an offence to sell sex in Ireland since 2017 but for those who have succeeded in exiting prostitution, previous convictions can be a significant obstacle as they attempt to move on with their lives. </p>  <p>  The initiative to expunge convictions firmly asserts our national policy position that the focus of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s attention is not directed towards those in the sex trade, who are exploited and victimised, but rather towards those who are responsible for exploiting them and those who purchase and demand services.</p>  <p>  The offences in question will be those secured under section 7 or 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, where the person was convicted on the basis of evidence that they were offering their services as a prostitute to another person.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have identified 607 convictions comprising 402 convictions recorded for soliciting or importuning for the purposes of prostitution, contrary to section 7 and 205 convictions for loitering for the purposes of prostitution &ndash; failing to comply with a direction of a Garda, contrary to Section 8.</p>  <p>  An offence of brothel keeping will not be expunged as it remains a criminal offence. However, as with any criminal conviction, if new evidence comes to light that would impact the basis on which the person was originally convicted, that person can seek to have the conviction overturned/quashed. In such instances, the person is advised to seek legal advice.</p></reply>

While I have no current proposal to adjust the rate of fees, the matter is kept generally under review.</p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Immigration Act 2004 provides that a register of non-nationals who have permission to be in the State (in general for a period of 3 months or longer) shall be established and maintained by registration officers and also provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer for the issue of a registration certificate. This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services.  </p>  <p>  The current fee applicable on registration is &euro;300. Registration is normally granted for 12 months or for the period determined by the applicant's requirement to be in the State, for example an employment contract of less than 12 months or a course of study lasting 8 months. </p>  <p>  The IRP card provides the customer with a secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State. This high quality secure document is easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies alike.    </p>  <p>  It certifies that a person is legally registered with the Irish immigration authorities and  provides details of the immigration permission held, for example a Stamp 1 or 4, etc. Once a person has an in date IRP card, there is no requirement to apply for a re-entry visa when returning to the State after a short period abroad.</p></reply>

This has enabled sustained ongoing recruitment into the organisation.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p><p>Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 31 May 2021, there are 13 designated Community Garda&iacute; in the Laois/Offaly Division, including 12 at Garda rank and 1 sergeant.</p><p>Again, it is important to note that the official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those officers who are exclusively assigned to particular community engagement tasks.  In overall terms, however, community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.In this regard, as at 31 May 2021, there were 375 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Laois/Offaly Divison, which represents an increase of 35% since 2015. These Garda members are supported by 38 Garda staff.</p><p>This strong focus on community  has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic.

The approach outlined by the Garda Commissioner is intended to addresses the challenges of modern day policing and has my full support. </p>  <p>  The new operating model includes restructuring at National, Regional and Divisional levels to provide for more front-line Garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility, and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area. Under the Divisional Policing Model, all services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level, to allow greater specialisation and to release Garda&iacute; from back office functions. Garda Districts will no longer form part of the organisational structure. </p>  <p>  I am confident that, as envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing, the adoption of this new policing model will strengthen the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the country.</p></reply>

The level of business supports is unprecedented. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Government introduced a Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), with the aim to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government's other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. </p>  <p>  The 2nd phase of this scheme was amended to take into account businesses who were not eligible to apply for Phase 1.  An expanded SBASC is now open for applications through the local authority with a closing date of 21st July.  </p>  <p>  Phase 2 has been expanded to include businesses working from a non rateable premises and those whose turnover is below &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  Businesses who are working from non rateable premises and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive a &euro;4,000 grant and businesses whose turnover is below &euro;50,000 and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive &euro;1,000 grant.  The purpose of these grants are to help meet fixed costs associated with running a business.</p>  <p>  The business referred to may be eligible for this scheme and further details including the application form are available on Local Authority websites.</p></reply>

A receiver is appointed on behalf of a secured creditor to sell the particular company asset which has been charged in favour of that creditor. A receiver is appointed under a) the terms of the debenture for stated reasons or b) by court order. </p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 has application only to receivers who are appointed to preserve, manage or sell the property of a company. The provisions of Part 8 amongst other things, disqualify certain persons from being appointed as receiver, set out their statutory powers and duties following appointment,  require that certain information be submitted to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, and provide for the regulation and enforcement of their duties. </p>  <p>  Under the Act the receiver must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale. This makes it imperative that they obtain expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property. The Act also provides that an application may be made to court for directions concerning the performance by the receiver of their functions. Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred. In addition, misconduct by receivers must be reported to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG), a statutory advisory body, was requested to examine and recommend ways in which company law could be potentially amended to ensure the better governance of receivers appointed to the property of a company. </p>  <p>  In May 2019, the CLRG submitted its report which is available publicly on the CLRG website. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the regulation of receivers. The CLRG's recommendations will be considered by my officials with a view to progressing any necessary legislation as soon as is practicable.   </p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.   Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has done an initial check of speeds being delivered to the premises referred which suggests that the premises can only get speeds below 30Mbps.  The issue may be related to a line fault as the indicators are that all the other premises in the same estate can get 70 to 90Mbps. We have raised this particular case with the service provider  operating in the area and will revert to the Deputy as soon as a response is received.</p></reply>

My Department has begun an engagement with the Local Authorities to inform this work. </p><p>I am also aware that work is advancing by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The sub-committee preparing this document is being chaired by Wicklow County Council. </p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme in early Autumn to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p><p>Thirteen local authorities have been in touch with SEAI in relation to the scheme with both Louth County Council and Dublin City Council making official applications for 20 charge points and nine charge points respectively.

I look forward to the delivery of much improved active travel infrastructure in the next few years as well as improvements to the commuter rail network, such as the proposals in relation to Ceannt Station, Oranmore Station and indeed the Athenry to Galway rail corridor generally. </p><p>The move toward evidence based, plan-led transport planning for our major cities allows for consideration of all relevant issues and the potential role all modes of transport can play in addressing those issues. I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.</p><p>Given the time that has elapsed since publication of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy </i>there is a need to review it and take stock of developments since its publication.

The most recent extension, made in May, ensures no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits in 2021. Furthermore, I have asked officials in my department to engage with the NTA to work on bringing about an extension to the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, and I recognise the purchase of a vehicle is a major cost for taxi operators.

Newer systems such as Luas are fully accessible. </p>  <p>  However, there are legacy issues in relation to older infrastructure and facilities, for example our Victorian era railway stations. To address these infrastructural legacy issues, my Department funds the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme, which is managed by the NTA. The four year capital envelope for public transport announced in Budget 2018 included a multi-annual indicative allocation of approximately &euro;28 million for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme for the period 2018 to 2021. </p>  <p>  The indicative annual allocations, in Budget 2018, under this four year Plan were &euro;4m in 2018, &euro;7m in 2019, &euro;7m in 2020 and &euro;9.8m in 2021. The indicative allocation for 2021 is now &euro;10.6m. This ring-fenced funding of approximately &euro;28m was a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  This funding facilitates the continued roll-out of programmes to progressively make public transport accessible, including the installation of accessible bus stops in rural areas, the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and the provision of grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) into the taxi fleet.</p>  <p>  Aside from the dedicated Retro-fit Programme for accessibility improvements, there are also other infrastructure projects and programmes which benefit all members of society and which are particularly important for people with disabilities, persons with reduced mobility and older people. For example, &ldquo;Wayfinding&rdquo; signage at train stations designed to accessibility standards, helps people with visual impairments. </p>  <p>  In addition to funding under the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme, a ring-fenced rail lift refurbishment / replacement programme was established by the NTA in 2020. The programme is to renew and replace life-expired lifts and lifts in poor condition, to ensure the reliability and availability of lift access. Lifts in rail stations out of service significantly impacts people with disabilities, reduced mobility and older people who rely on properly functioning lifts to enable them to access rail services.</p>  <p>  On 10 March 2021, Irish Rail announced details of the 2021 rail station lift and escalator replacement and renewal programme. The upgrade of lifts in train stations is a key step towards making public transport accessible for all. The 2021 programme comprises an investment of &euro;5.8 million, funded by the NTA, which includes the boost in Budget 2021 of an additional &euro;2 million allocation from my Department allowing for acceleration of the programme. This additional Exchequer funding from Budget 2021 will accelerate delivery of this accessibility programme.</p>  <p>  Any percentage increases over whatever timeframe, using whatever basis, may be calculated from the figures above. However, I would caution that whatever calculations the Deputy might use, such figures would only be speculative.  Future funding levels will, as with other programmes and projects, be subject to the annual Estimate and Budgetary processes.</p></reply>

The RSA reopened its network of test centres and will be permitted to conduct 25,000 driver theory tests per month. </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, the RSA provided 15,000 tests per month. In light of the significant backlog of customers, capacity will gradually increase to 25,000 tests.  From reopening in the week beginning 7 June to the end of the week of 28 June, the service conducted 22,573 tests.  A further 4,093 people who had booked a test were no-shows.  </p>  <p>  The test centres have extensive COVID-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. It is hoped that capacity will gradually increase further to 50,000 tests monthly, if public health guidance permits.  </p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test service provider has sourced an additional 40 temporary team members to support the expected increase in capacity to 50,000 in-centre appointments when permitted to do so. </p>  <p>  The RSA has also been working to deliver an online theory test service, with a pilot online test already undertaken for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include car and motorbike tests. The theory test service provider has sourced 30 additional employees to manage the online testing facility. The tests are conducted under strict requirements in order to adequately verify the identity of candidates, and to ensure exams are completed in a secure manner, maintaining the integrity of the exam content and to prevent cheating or fraud. It is hoped that the service provider will be able to deliver up to 10,000 theory tests online in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Any issues in relation to the delivery of the contract are for the Road Safety Authority as the contracting authority and third parties cannot interpose themselves in such contractual relationships.  I am therefore referring those elements of the Deputy's question to the Authority for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response is not received within 10 days. </p></reply>

It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking.

Once completed, the strategy will provide a key framework for ensuring we continue to have sufficient infrastructure in place to keep ahead of demand, while also ensuring that appropriate planning and development guidelines are followed in providing the necessary capacity. It is envisaged that the strategy will be published later this year.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 2014 at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of addressing this market failure by stimulating increased activity in the sector. </p>  <p>  The incentive expired on 31 December 2018 following a review of the scheme.  The review found that in the context of the current housing supply shortage, and the need at that time to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there was a risk that the scheme could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The review concluded that the continuation of the scheme could give rise to displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations and would create a high opportunity cost of labour which was not present at the inception of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Also, in 2019, in the context of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) deliberations, my department examined the concept of a tax incentive along the lines of the HRI for domestic retrofit projects. The relevant TSG paper was published with the Budget 2020 documentation. It indicated that there could be a duplication of supports with the direct Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant system already in place and that a scheme such as this could conflict with the need to increase overall housing supply.  </p>  <p>  The paper observed that:</p>  <p>  - in terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home through the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Deep retrofit Grant programme;</p>  <p>  - research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support such as tax credits); and</p>  <p>  - from an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes.</p>  <p>  More generally, proposals for tax expenditure measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p></reply>

In fulfilling its statutory role in this regard, the Central Bank adopts a robust, structured and risk-based process that seeks to ensure that only those applicants that demonstrate compliance with the relevant authorisation and fitness and probity standards are registered.  The Central Bank seeks to process each application as expeditiously as possible while meeting its obligation to operate a rigorous and effective gatekeeper function.</p>  <p>  While an applicant seeking registration under the IDR may hold another authorisation from the Central Bank, its application for registration must be assessed having regard to the relevant authorisation standards applicable in the context of the IDR, and the Central Bank must be satisfied as to the fitness and probity of proposed PCF role holders at the time of the new application. </p>  <p>  Under the Fitness and Probity regime introduced by the Central Bank under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, all individuals must be pre-approved by the Central Bank prior to taking up a new PCF role. This includes any individuals who have previously been approved. Any authorised firms seeking to do business under a new sector must apply for authorisation under that sector and any individuals intending to take up a PCF role under that new authorisation are also required to seek approval from the Central Bank before commencing the role.</p>  <p>  The Fitness &amp;amp; Probity regime is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s gatekeeping process and protects consumers and investors by requiring that persons in senior functions within regulated firms meet the Central Bank&rsquo;s Fitness &amp;amp; Probity Standards.  As part of its assessment, the Central Bank may hold one or more interviews with a PCF role holder applicant, where the Central Bank considers it necessary to assist in its assessment.  In respect of low risk firms, while interviews are not generally carried out as standard practice, they are carried out where specific fitness and probity concerns arise and/or on a sample basis. The Fitness &amp;amp; Probity Interview Guide, which is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website (Link 2 below) provides an overview of the fitness and probity interview process to assist PCF role holder applicants who are invited to attend for interview. </p>  <p>  All PCF applications undergo a desk assessment and the Bank may seek National Vetting Bureau clearance, employer references, external regulator references. In addition applicants may be invited for an interview to support the assessment.</p>  <p>  The Minimum Competency Code 2017 (MCC) and the Minimum Competency Regulations 2017 (MCR) set out minimum professional standards, competencies and obligations for persons providing certain financial services, in particular when dealing with consumers. The aim is to ensure that consumers obtain a minimum acceptable level of competence from individuals acting for or on behalf of regulated firms in the provision of advice and other associated activities in relation to retail financial products.  Individuals falling within the scope of the MCC must meet the requirements (e.g. hold a recognised qualification) in respect of each type of retail financial product for which they will provide advice on or offer.</p>  <p>  Link 1: (www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-market-sectors/brokers-retail-intermediaries/authorisation-process)</p>  <p>  Link 2: (www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/regulation/how-we-regulate/fitness-probity/fitness-and-probity-interview-guide.pdf)</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-08a.482.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070800087#WRH04300"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland have any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the <i>Solvency II</i>Directive).</p><p>Having said that, the Government is acutely aware of the concerns felt by many sectors, including the one highlighted by the Deputy, regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform. In this regard, the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can impose on business, community and voluntary organisations. The Plan is ambitious, with 95% of actions due to be completed in 2021, and work is continuing across several Government departments to deliver these key reforms.</p><p>Among the most significant achievements to date has been the creation of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market </i>within my Department. The role of the Office, which is chaired by my colleague Minister of State Fleming, is twofold: to assist in reducing insurance costs, and increasing the availability of cover, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. The Office is working closely with the IDA which is attempting to identify potential new entrants for the Irish insurance market. Areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; include: construction-related professional indemnity; tourism/hospitality; and high-footfall amenities such as those highlighted by the Deputy.</p><p>I would like to add there have been some encouraging developments in the last few weeks in relation to specialist insurers entering the market in some of these segments. I remain positive that, though its work, the Competition Office can help encourage more suppliers to enter the market and provide more choice for consumers.</p><p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

The level of business supports is unprecedented. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Government introduced a Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), with the aim to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government's other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. </p>  <p>  The 2nd phase of this scheme was amended to take into account businesses who were not eligible to apply for Phase 1.  An expanded SBASC is now open for applications through the local authority with a closing date of 21st July.  </p>  <p>  Phase 2 has been expanded to include businesses working from a non rateable premises and those whose turnover is below &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  Businesses who are working from non rateable premises and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive a &euro;4,000 grant and businesses whose turnover is below &euro;50,000 and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive &euro;1,000 grant.

In certain settings, such as live performances, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity or require them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.  Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.  Accordingly live music is not currently permitted.  As the Deputy is aware however, Government will be reviewing COVID restrictions before the 19th of July and I secured the agreement of Government last month to review the restrictions on performances at licensed venues, such as restaurants, pubs and hotels.</p>  <p>  In addition to reviewing the position pilot events are taking place across June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme. These events will assist in safely charting a path back to greater levels of activity in line with developments in public health guidance over the coming weeks and months.  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities and in order to evaluate and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors. </p>  <p>  I remain firmly committed to the full return of all live entertainment at the earliest possible date, having regard to public health developments, and the pilot performances, together with a wide range of horizontal and direct supports for the sector, are all part of a suite of measures designed to sustain and support the sector in its recovery.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of sector specific supports in addition to a broad range of horizontal supports.  These include the &euro;25 million Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 (LPSS 2021). The allocations for this scheme have been recently announced and I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website. The closing date for this scheme as been extended to 21 July. </p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.  The details of this scheme are currently being considered and will be announced in due course. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support. </p></reply>

The grants include the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People, which are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of this scheme including assessment, approval and prioritisation, is the responsibility of local authorities.  Local authorities receive an overall allocation, with the responsibility for the apportionment between the three schemes being a matter for each authority given their knowledge of local need. </p><p>My Department's approach each year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can plan and implement the grants programme. Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities which have high levels of grant activity. My Department will give due consideration to any request received from Tipperary County Council for additional Exchequer funding in this regard. </p><p>My Department recommends that all valid applications should be processed within 6 weeks from the date of submission. However, in the event of a backlog, local authorities should prioritise applications on the basis of the medical needs of the applicant. Tipperary County Council has advised my Department that it is currently dealing with a backlog of applications. Officials from my Department have engaged with the Council and have emphasised that the Scheme must be open to all applicants and ensure that they are dealt with in accordance with Departmental guidelines.</p><p>The schemes are means tested and operate on a sliding scale with the highest percentage grants available to those with the lowest incomes and vice versa.  Grant assistance is not available to applicants whose household income, after disregards and deductions, exceeds &euro;60,000 per annum. Local authorities must adhere to the income thresholds set down by the regulations, so that the funding is focused on those households who need it most. In administering the schemes, local authorities should always work with qualifying applicants to ensure they get the most beneficial outcome possible in line with their financial circumstances.  My Department will commence a review this year of the means test criteria and maximum grant limits applicable to the housing adaptation grants.</p><p>Separately, grant aid may be considered for the provision of infrastructural and safety related adaptations to create appropriate space for applicants with specific sensory needs. Applications of this nature should be supported by a multidisciplinary assessment of the applicant by specialist healthcare professionals. This should outline who will be responsible for therapy services and/or the provision and upkeep of sensory related equipment. The scheme does not fund the provision of sensory equipment. </p><p>Funding of &euro;75 million is available nationally in 2021 for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme. This funding has increased year on year since 2014.  As part of the annual budgetary process, consideration will be given to increasing this funding in future years in line with the Programme for Government commitments and the Policy Statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>  </i></p></reply>

In addition, any person or a planning authority may seek a court order under section 160 of the Act in relation to unauthorised development with a view to ensuring that the development works in question are not carried out or continued. </p>  <p>  In this connectionn, section 157(4)(a)(i) of the Act provides that enforcement proceedings shall not be commenced in respect of development where no permission has been granted, after seven years from the date of commencement of development.  Under section 157(4)(aa), enforcement action may be taken against unauthorised quarrying or unauthorised peat extraction at any time.</p>  <p>  Enforcement proceedings against unauthorised developments other than quarries or peat extraction may be commenced at any time within the seven year period referred to where the planning authority receives representations from any person under section 152(1)(a) or in accordance with section 125(1)(b) where it otherwise appears to the authority that unauthorised development may have been, is being or may be carried out.</p>  <p>  Where enforcement proceedings have commenced, in accordance with Section 162(3) of the Act, no enforcement shall be stayed or withdrawn by reason of an application for permission for retention of unauthorised development under section 34(12C) of the Act or the grant of that permission. </p>  <p>  Provision for the recoupment of costs arising from enforcement action taken by planning authorities is provided for under section 154 of the Act. Section 154(5)(b) provides that an enforcement notice shall require that such steps as may be specified in the notice be taken within a specified period, including, where appropriate, the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure and the discontinuance of any use and, in so far as is practicable, the restoration of the land to its condition prior to the commencement of the development.</p>  <p>  Section 154(5)(c) further provides that if the steps specified in the enforcement notice are not taken within a specified period (not being more than 6 months), the planning authority may enter on the land and take such steps and may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in that behalf.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 154(5)(d) provides that an enforcement notice shall require the person or persons served with the notice to refund to the planning authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority, including costs incurred in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers. </p>  <p>  Section 154(7) further provides that if required, any expenses reasonably incurred by a planning authority may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person or persons on whom the notice was served. Alternatively, the costs incurred by a planning authority may be secured by charging the land under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, or where the person on whom the enforcement notice was served is the owner of the land, an instrument vesting the ownership of the land in the authority subject to a right of redemption by the owner within five years. </p>  <p>  Section 156 sets out the penalties that may be applied in relation to non-compliance with specific sections of the Act. In this connection, 156(1) provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.  It further provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both.  Under section 156(2) of the Act, where a person is convicted of an offence and there is a continuation by him/her of the offence after his/her conviction, he or she shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention continues and for each such offence shall be liable.  </p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.  </p></reply>

However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings, with the number of inspections falling to 25,703 in 2020. </p><p>The number of private rental inspections undertaken by the four Dublin local authorities in 2019 and 2020 are set out in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Local   Authorities</td>       <td>18,137</td>       <td>11,053*</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Includes 1,226 virtual inspections </p><p>The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response does not permit rental inspections at present. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. The CCMA Framework is developed in accordance with Government public health guidance and restrictions and is reviewed as necessary and in line with updated guidance and restrictions.</p><p>In response to the pandemic some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative, which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so. </p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. My Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them and providing Exchequer funding to those that do. </p><p>Some 1,400 virtual inspections were undertaken in 2020 by Dublin City Council, Kildare County Council and Monaghan County Council. Q1 2021 saw nearly 1,900 virtual inspections conducted. There are now 20 local authorities participating in the pilot project, including all four Dublin local authorities.</p><p>Annual data in respect of the level of inspections carried out by each local authority is available on my Department's website at <i></i></p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of applications was 30 June 2021. My Department received seven applications by the deadline: </p>  <p>  1. The Cultural Landscape of the Burren Uplands, County Clare;</p>  <p>  2. Iniscealtra (Inis Cealtra/Inishcaltra/Holy Island), County Clare;</p>  <p>  3. The Chq Building and George&rsquo;s Dock (Formally Custom House Docks), Dublin City;</p>  <p>  4. Trans-Atlantic Cable Ensemble: Valentia, County Kerry-Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.</p>  <p>  5. Royal Sites of Ireland, Counties Kildare, Westmeath, Tipperary, Roscommon and Meath (it should be noted that the Royal sites of Ireland also envisages the inclusion of Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha), County Armagh as part of a transnational nomination of the Royal Sites of Ireland);</p>  <p>  6. The Passage Tomb Landscape of County Sligo; and </p>  <p>  7. Glendalough Valley, County Wicklow.</p>  <p>  An initial screening of the applications received has determined that the Chq Building and George&rsquo;s Dock application does not meet the basic requirements to progress to assessment by the independent Expert Advisory Group (EAG) established by me to evaluate the Tentative List applications.  </p>  <p>  The EAG is comprised of four experts in the heritage sector; Dr Carol Westrik, Chairperson and World Heritage Expert; Dr Alison Sheridan, International Archaeological Expert; Prof Elizabeth Fitzpatrick, Irish Archaeological Expert; and Ms Jane Jackson, Industrial Architectural Expert.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, the EAG will evaluate the remaining six applications based on the ability of each of those applications to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value, integrity and/or authenticity, long-term protection and management frameworks, and evidence of local stakeholder support. It is intended that the EAG will complete its evaluation and make recommendations as to which properties should be considered for inclusion on a new Tentative List by early September. </p>  <p>  Any EAG recommendations will then be appraised by the National Monuments Service of my Department in terms of their readiness and suitability to form a new Tentative List for Ireland. Subject to my approval, it is envisaged that this new Tentative List, which will replace the existing Tentative List, will be submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre early in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that in order for a property to proceed to nomination for full World Heritage status, it must first be on the Tentative List for at least one year. Eventual nomination to full World Heritage Status, which will be led by my Department in partnership with relevant Local Authorities and stakeholders, will include the preparation of detailed nomination documentation and conservation and management plans. This stage of the process, including further public consultation, is expected to take a number of years to finalise, and local support and engagement will be critical to any subsequent and successful nomination. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Tentative List process will be reopened for review within the next five years to allow my Department further assess other sites that may be proposed that may demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value. This may include properties on the current Tentative List for which applications were not submitted under the current application process. </p></reply>

It is vital that all sides take immediate action to deescalate the current situation, and to allow for dialogue to take place.</p>  <p>  The right to peaceful protest is a fundamental human right, enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Citizens&rsquo; rights to demonstrate and to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly must be respected and protected, and must not be suppressed by force. The killing of civilians, the use of violence and the destruction of property are unacceptable and must be investigated thoroughly and transparently, with perpetrators prosecuted according to the law. </p>  <p>  I welcome the joint statements issued on 1 and 4 July by the Missions of the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States in Eswatini, and I echo their calls for inclusive dialogue, respect for civil liberties, and respect for the rule of law. I also welcome the efforts of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to facilitate dialogue to resolve the situation peacefully. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Eswatini, based in Mozambique, is in regular communication with the European Union (EU) Delegation and EU counterparts in Eswatini. In June 2021, Ireland, together with the EU Delegation and Member States, participated in a formal dialogue with the Government of Eswatini, in which the EU raised concerns regarding democratic space and human rights in Eswatini. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to follow up and engage on these issues through the EU Delegation in Eswatini, and to monitor this situation closely. </p></reply>

While it is important that nothing is said or done that could be seen to prejudice ongoing due legal process, it is vital that the rationale for these decisions is clearly communicated.</p>  <p>  All victims&rsquo; families must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice in accordance with the law and regardless of the perpetrator. Officials from my Department are keeping in contact with the families at this time on behalf of the Government. </p>  <p>  It is essential that we make progress in addressing the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland. Our position is that the Stormont House Agreement, which was agreed by the two Governments and political parties, provides the framework to address the legacy of the Troubles. Where there are genuine concerns regarding its implementation, or proposals to further strengthen it in different areas, we are ready to engage together with the parties and the British Government to find a collective way forward. Crucially, victims and survivors must be at the heart of this process. </p>  <p>  At the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June last, we agreed with the British Government that we would begin a process of intensive engagement. Secretary of State Brandon Lewis and I issued a joint invitation and framework paper to party leaders last week, inviting them to begin this process. The first meeting at working group level has already taken place, and meetings are scheduled to continue throughout the period ahead. As outlined in the framework document issued to party leaders last week, our objective is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both this jurisdiction and the UK, by the end of this autumn.</p></reply>

This policy has not changed nor are there any plans to change it. </p>  <p>  Membership of PESCO and participation in the EPF have no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.  Participation in PESCO relates to the collaborative development of military capabilities in support of CSDP operations launched in support of international peace and security and in accordance with the UN Charter. The European Peace Facility incorporates the existing EU Athena Mechanism on the funding of common costs of CSDP missions and operations in which Ireland has participated for many years, and the existing African Peace Facility albeit with a broader mandate.  including allowing EU financing of peace support operations outside of Africa.  While the EPF may, in certain circumstances and with strong safeguards, provide funding for military equipment up to and including lethal force equipment, Ireland made clear from the start of negotiations that we would not fund assistance measures which include such weapons reflecting the Programme for Government commitment that &lsquo;Ireland will not be part of decision making or funding for lethal force weapons for non-peacekeeping purposes&rsquo; and this is reflected in the Council Decision. </p>  <p>  Neither PESCO nor the EPF represent new organisations but rather mechanisms within the framework of the EU treaties to support CSDP. </p></reply>

The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>The initial outlay cost of a Naval Service vessel depends on several factors, including the date that it was built and the specification and type of vessel. The service life of a Naval Service vessel is generally in the region of 30 years and is determined by the level of the ship's operational activity. Details are provided below for the different classes of vessels within the Naval Service fleet of 9 ships, including ship names and the approximate initial outlay for that class of vessel. </p><p>P31 LE Eithne: Cost approximately &pound;25 million, commissioned in 1984.</p><p>P41 L&Eacute; Orla, P42 L&Eacute; Ciara: Cost approximately &pound;Stg8 million in total for both ships.

The MRV project is an important capability development project and indicative of the commitment to ongoing investment in and development of defence capabilities. It is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV, subject to availability of funding within the overall defence capital funding envelope. Projects for other vessel replacements will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding, and in accordance with the overall equipment development planning process. </p></reply>

The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fisheries protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. I am advised by the military authorities that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements. On any given patrol day, the Naval Service can carry out a number of tasks on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service has nine ships in the fleet, of which six are currently available. L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Eithne are currently in operational reserve, but can be called upon for surge operations in times of national emergency, as was the case when L&Eacute; Eithne was deployed to Cork city from 20 March to 24 June last year in support of Operation Fortitude and the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The military authorities have advised that there would be a minimal cost in terms of maintenance, servicing and certification of equipment associated with returning both ships to operational status.</p>  <p>  L&Eacute; Niamh is commencing a pre-planned Mid Life Extension Programme of works, similar to one recently completed on L&Eacute; Roisin which has returned into service.

The Office was staffed by 4 persons (2 civil/2 military) on a full-time basis. As significant progress has been made and the majority of projects have been finalised, the staffing of the Office has been scaled down with the 4 persons engaged on a part-time basis alongside their other duties. </p><p>There are fifteen projects in total in the HLIP. For some, the original target dates and timelines for completion were extended due to external factors, including Covid and the status of the projects is as outlined below. </p><p>The immediate pay measures set out in the plan i.e. an increase in Military Service Allowance, the reversal of 10% cuts to allowances under the Haddington Road Agreement, and the restoration of weekend premium rates for overtime were implemented immediately upon their acceptance by the PDF Representative Associations in late 2019. A service commitment scheme for pilots was also re-introduced, with very positive uptake. </p><p>For the project Review of Technical Pay Groups 2 &ndash; 6, sanction has recently been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed with the recommendations in the report. This will now be progressed through the Department&rsquo;s Conciliation and Arbitration Process.</p><p>The Review of Pay Structures project, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was intended to examine pay structures in the Defence Forces and to fall under the new public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo;. However, in the intervening period, the Commission on the Defence Forces was tasked with examining pay structures and also with some aspects of pay under the sectoral bargaining arrangements of this agreement. The recommendations of a further project dealing with incentivised long service arrangements for certain Officer and NCO ranks, will be considered in the context of the sectoral bargaining element of &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo;. </p><p>The project relating to Bespoke Management training for leaders and managers was completed in July 2020.  The project on Non-Pay Retention Measures in the PDF was completed in October 2020. The Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy was launched on 2nd December 2020.  A further project to develop a Professional Military Education strategy was completed in March 2021 and the Strategy will be launched shortly. The project relating to additional specialist posts for high turnover/long lead in appointments was finalised in April 2021. The report relating to the review of recruitment in the PDF has been completed and will be submitted for my approval imminently.</p><p>The project examining Barriers to Extended Participation in the PDF was split into two phases. Phase 1 focussed on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for Officers and is nearing completion pending clarification from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a matter relating to pension rules. Phase 2 is examining the contracts of service for enlisted personnel and is at an advanced stage. </p><p>The final project, looking at the embedding of strategic workforce planning in the Defence Forces has commenced and its work is ongoing. As this is a long term project it will be progressed through the joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group. </p><p>There have been regular briefings to the Representative Associations on the progress of the implementation of the HLIP projects and my Department continues to engage on all matters that fall within the scope of representation. A total of 12 meetings/briefings have taken place to date, 10 of which took place prior to the commencement of discussions on the new public service pay agreement &quot;Building on Momentum&quot;.</p></reply>

This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six students with complex needs in schools.</p><p>However to meet the specific needs of different siblings with special needs in the home, an increased shared allocation is provided for siblings as set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of siblings</th>       <th>2 Children</th>       <th>3 Children</th>       <th>4 Children</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Hours per week</td>       <td>15 per week for 4 weeks</td>       <td>20 per week for 4 weeks</td>       <td>25 per week for 4 weeks</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Separate allocations of 10 hours per week will be provided to a child where that child is:</p><p>- Attending school at a different educational level to their sibling &ndash; (i.e. one child is primary and the other is post-primary)</p><p>- One child is in a specialised setting (i.e. one child in a special class or a special school and the other child in mainstream)</p><p>- Where two eligible children are each in a specialised setting (i.e. a special class or a special school)</p><p>- Or where one sibling is living in a separate home. </p><p>The family referred to by the Deputy did not meet the conditions to receive separate allocations and have been advised accordingly in correspondence from the Department. </p><p>The allocations for the 2021 summer programme are independent of any allocations made during the Supplementary Programme, which was put in place during the period of school closures earlier in the year.</p><p>The Department is satisfied that the allocation of supports to families where siblings are undertaking a home based programme is fair, equitable and reflective of how the home based programme is generally provided when more than one child avails of the provision in a family home. The fact that there are circumstances where additional hours are provided, as outlined above, when children have differing levels of need, school setting or residence means the scheme is responsive to these situations.</p></reply>

The development process is a thorough one involving extensive consultation, following which the subject specification is approved through the representative structures of the NCCA and subsequently approved by my Department.  The State Examinations Commission then implements examinations in line with the subject specification and the overall policy framework. </p><p>The Leaving Certificate Mandarin Chinese specification was designed as an ab initio course, in the sense that the targeted learners are Irish or international students with no previous knowledge of the language. While heritage speakers are certainly allowed to study the course and sit the exam, the specification is not designed for them.  As a result of this design intent, traditional characters are not covered by the specification and, in line with this, candidates must respond to the questions on the examination paper using the simplified characters.The inclusion of traditional characters is not suitable for a specification pitched at ab initio level.</p><p>Mandarin Chinese is one of four new language specifications being introduced in line with <i>Languages Connect - Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017-2026</i>.  All of these new language specifications broadly align with the Common European Framework of Reference for languages (CEFR). In CEFR, there is an EU project called European Benchmarking Chinese Language (EBCL) to incorporate the Chinese language into the CEFR framework.  It may be noted that this benchmark itself did not incorporate traditional characters. The potential use of traditional characters as part of the Leaving Certificate subject specification was considered at design stage, and the decision to base the reading and writing aspects of the specification on simplified characters only was a conscious one, for the reasons outlined above. If the design had instead been such as to encompass both sets of characters, the differences in the two forms of characters would also have had implications for vocabulary, syntax, language use and potentially culture as well. This would present great challenges across teaching, learning and assessment, which would also have impacts on Higher Education language programmes and Initial Teacher Education. </p><p>The State Examinations Commission is required to conduct its examinations in a manner that is faithful to the approved subject specification developed by the NCCA and in line with assessment policy as set out by my Department.For the reasons above, I have no plans at this time to ask the State Examinations Commission to conduct a review or re-evaluation of the marking standards to be applied in Leaving Certificate Mandarin Chinese in 2022, or of the requirement on candidates to use simplified Chinese characters in the examination.</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;5.7m was allocated to the school-based programme, and 9.8m was spent on the home-based programme.  The remainder was spent on DEIS literacy and numeracy camps at primary level.</p><p>In 2020 the total cost of the expanded Summer Programme was &euro;20.4million.  Of this, &euro;6.5 million was allocated to the school-based programme and &euro;12.3 million was spent on the home-based programme.  The remainder was spent on the DEIS literacy and numeracy camp at primary level and a new DEIS post-primary programme.</p><p>Increasing the cost of the school-based programme by 5%, 10% and 25% of the 2020 figure would bring this figure to &euro;6.825m, &euro;7.15m and &euro;8.125m respectively.</p><p>Increasing the cost of the home-based programme by 5%, 10% and 25% on the 2020 figure would bring this figure to &euro;12.915m, &euro;13.53m and &euro;15.375m respectively.</p><p>The total funding which has been made available to provide the expanded summer programme in 2021 is up to &euro;40 million.  Details of the actual costs of running the school-based programme will be available in October, while the details of the costs of running the home-based programme will be available in November. Details of the total costs for 2021 will not be known until the participation rates have been finalised. </p><p>For the purpose of the school-based summer programme for 2021, schools registered their interest on an online portal.  Some schools had the option of registering for up to three programmes.  The closing date for registrations was 25 June 2021.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005.</p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing.</p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council.</p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash;</p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs.</p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons.

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>There are currently 13,623 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools, at a cost of approximately  &euro;817 Million per annum, for a full year cost. </p><p>This allocation represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>The additional cost of providing for an additional 100 Special Education Teachers would be approximately &euro;6 Million per annum, based on a full year costs.</p></reply>

Information from the tests is important given the vital role of literacy and numeracy in enabling children to access the full curriculum. </p>  <p>  The results of standardised tests can help schools to evaluate progress in literacy and numeracy and can help to pinpoint areas for improvement. They can be used at both classroom and whole-school level to inform teaching and learning, to identify the children who may be experiencing difficulty and require additional support as well as identify those children that are performing really well and require additional challenge in their learning.</p>  <p>  However, the results of any one standardised test should not be used in isolation, nor used as baseline data for predicting future achievements, nor for solely informing decisions regarding the provision of interventions or targets within learning plans for pupils. Information from ability tests, teacher observations, parental reports, as well as the views of the pupils are also very important aspects of a thorough assessment.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the closure of schools for extended periods on two separate occasions, over the past two years, due to COVID restrictions, has meant that this has been a very difficult period for our young people and students. As the educational environment returns to normality, there will be opportunities to fully reflect on the impact of school closures on children. There is currently some Irish and international research available on the impact of the period of school closures on students. </p>  <p>  My officials are working to consider how best to support schools and students as they return to school in September for the coming school year 2021/22. Further research will be also be required in Ireland to measure the full extent of the impact that educational disruption, has had on children. Further details will be provided in relation to any proposals to mitigate against lost learning time, in the coming weeks, once these considerations have been concluded.</p>  <p>  In relation to the standardised testing the Department receives the data at school aggregate level from schools on an annual basis. In relation to the 2020/2021 data this has not yet been returned from all schools to date. When all the data has been received the Department intends to use this data through a comparison of the distribution of high, medium and low scores at system level aggregates such as DEIS category of school, rural/urban location, and so on, to determine whether any loss of learning suggested by the changes is constant across the system, or whether certain groups of schools in the system have experienced a greater or lesser decline than the population averages. </p>  <p>  This system-level analysis will provide one source of evidence that the Department will be able to use in order to target resources, both short-term and longer-term, to support equity in the system. This analysis will not be carried out on individual schools as it would be inappropriate to do so.</p>  <p>   My Department will continue to prioritise investment in special education, with over &euro;2 billion due to be spent on special education this year, in supporting the additional learning needs of pupils in our schools. In addition to prioritising pupils with special educational needs to return to school, my Department has also provided for a range of measures to support such pupils while out of school. This included measures to support the provision of teaching support during the school closure period, a supplementary education scheme, and an enhanced summer education programme, which will take place this year.

These children were impacted greatly by Covid-19 and the closure of schools.  The Government provided guidance and support for schools throughout this period and put in place a supplementary tuition programme for these children in March this year. </p>  <p>  In May 2021 the Government announced a package of supports to allow primary and post primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage, as a COVID-19 pandemic response measure for summer 2021. </p>  <p>  The total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million, a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer programmes in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programmes on offer this summer include a new 2-3 week summer programme available to all primary schools and an expansion of the existing programmes in special schools and classes and in DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  This range of programmes on offer builds on the success of the expanded programmes that ran last year and incorporates feedback from education stakeholders as to how to better support the programme for all involved in summer 2021.</p>  <p>  The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups. The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for those who are at key transition stages, help to ensure that they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further/higher education or training.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the summer programme was expanded in 2020 to include primary school children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment.  This has been widened under the 2021 summer programme to include children with sensory impairments attending post-primary school as well.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are a range of voluntary bodies, disability representative organisations, or other publicly funded bodies, who also provide some form of summer programmes for children with special educational needs. Many of these are useful and beneficial programmes which are high valued by parents and children. There is no impediment to such organisations continuing to provide such programmes.  </p>  <p>  The summer education programme which is run by this Department, however, is an educational programme and therefore the programme is provided by educational staff, such as Teachers and SNAs.</p>  <p>  In line with policy advice received from the NCSE, a review of the July Provision was commenced in 2019, was paused due to COVID and will get underway again shortly.   Consideration of the potential inclusion of other specialist supports, in future, will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.  </p>  <p>  Equipment such as FM Radio systems and Soundfield systems for children with a hearing impairment, Braille equipment to assist children with a visual impairment as well as personal computers and specialist software are amongst the items funded by my Department.  Schools apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support in the form of Assistive Technology.  </p>  <p>  Although the assistive technology is sanctioned for a particular pupil, the equipment will remain the property of the school and should normally be kept in the school. However, the pupil may, with the consent of the management authority, use the equipment at home. </p>  <p>  Where schools, or pupils, have received sanction for equipment under the Assistive Technology scheme, and are participating in the school based summer education programme, they may, with the agreement of the school, use this equipment during the summer programme, where necessary.</p>  <p>  Many pupils who have visual impairment also receive educational materials in the braille format, which are provided by the National Braille Production Centre. Again, where pupils use such materials, they may use these materials during the summer programme, where necessary.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: The urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my Department.  44,095 students in 301 primary schools benefit from the Urban School Meals Scheme.  188 of these schools also benefit from the local projects scheme. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option. </p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary.  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Applications are accepted from individual schools and organisations as well as organisations such as School Completion Programmes who apply for multiple schools.  The application process for 2021/2022 is currently open.</p>  <p>  Any request for additional funding for an enhanced school meals programme for 2022 and beyond will need to be considered as part of the budgetary process and, as is usual, I will work closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in that context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

However, where a person is not eligible for the scheme generally they are referred to their local housing authority to have their housing needs assessed and, if successful, would be placed on the housing list.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is administered by Local Authorities.

This scheme was introduced on 6 April 1994 and allows up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or for incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded in calculating an applicant&rsquo;s yearly average, and for homemaker credits to be awarded for homemaking periods of less than a full contribution year.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which an applicant&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average and making it easier for them to qualify for the most beneficial rate of state pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  This person&rsquo;s yearly average was calculated as 26 contributions and gave them an entitlement to a standard State pension (contributory) at 85% of the maximum rate.  They were notified in writing of this decision on 5 June 2015.</p>  <p>  An interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA), also known as the Aggregated Contributions Method, was introduced in January 2018 as an alternative to the yearly average method of calculating pension entitlement for those State pension (contributory) customers born on or after 1 September 1946 and therefore affected by post-2012 Budget pension rates.  The TCA provides for up to 20 years of HomeCaring Periods (HCP) in their pension entitlement calculation for applicants who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was invited on 4 April 2019 to apply for HCP and to have their pension reviewed, but did not respond at that time.  Their application for HCP was received on 12 May 2021 by my Department and 1,222 HCP credited contributions  were awarded in respect of childcaring duties for the person's five children.  A maximum of 1,040 HCP plus credited contributions can be used in the calculation of an applicant's pension entitlement under the interim TCA.</p>  <p>  On review of their State pension (contributory) entitlement, their rate of pension increased from 85% to 95% of the maximum pension. The revised decision issued to them in writing on 25 May 2021 with details of arrears due, backdated to 30 March 2018, in line with social welfare legislation.</p>  <p>  The person concerned is now in receipt of the correct rate of pension payable commensurate with their social insurance record held by my Department. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Tusla are also asked to become involved with children known to criminal justice agencies and children with complex disabilities. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s 17 operational areas are all inspected regularly by HIQA, as are a number of private foster care services which also employ social workers. While HIQA does not have a role in commenting on individual social work practice they have found that the majority of child protection and foster care teams provide a high or good level of service. Inspectors regularly comment in reports that social workers and other Tusla staff demonstrate a commitment to their work and a desire to see positive outcomes for children and families. Well performing areas are inspected through a quality assurance methodology. HIQA and Tusla have identified a minority of areas that do not meet standards to an adequate level and Tusla have dedicated action plans to improve these services. HIQA have identified that, in some areas, the social work resource, by way of numbers, stability or experience, is not in a position to adequately meet the demand for the service. HIQA adopt a proportionate approach to risk, and inspect areas that are not meeting standards more frequently. </p>  <p>  HIQA publishes inspection reports which are reviewed by my Department as part of a more general root cause analysis of services. It is important that, in conjunction with Tusla and other agencies, we identify what part policy, resources and local management contribute to the standard of services for vulnerable children and act on these findings. Indeed, my department recently brought together all the key stakeholders in this regard, HIQA included, at a roundtable meeting to ensure that we harness the collective learning and apply this to policy and practice.</p>  <p>  HIQA plays a vital role in providing assurance regarding Tusla services and their work has contributed to service improvements. With regard to Social Work practice, Irish social workers are required to register with CORU, Ireland's multi-profession health regulator. CORU promotes high standards of professional conduct, education and training, and competence through the registration of health and social care professionals. Where there is concern in relation to a particular social worker, CORU's complaints process is referred to as Fitness to Practise. Fitness to practice is concerned with those issues that affect a person's ability to practise in their profession, not just in their current job. This includes professional misconduct and poor professional performance.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-08a.736.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070800091#WRM04900"><p>I am very concerned to hear of providers proposing to increase charges to parents at a time when the Government continues to support early learning and childcare providers very significantly. In view of the extent of State support, increases are not justified at this time. </p><p>The Government has been strongly supportive of the sector, particularly since the onset of Covid-19. We have provided substantial additional supports to allow services to operate sustainably throughout the pandemic, acknowledging that there are higher delivery costs and many extra practical and financial challenges to be met. One of the objectives of these supports was to ensure that the higher delivery costs due to public health requirements and lower occupancy were not passed on to parents. </p><p>In addition to my Department's funding schemes, services can currently participate in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which provides an average of 50% of normal operating costs for services. The EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates since October 2020, and is due to continue until the end of December 2021. Most businesses must demonstrate a 30% reduction in turnover to be eligible for supports under the scheme. When the EWSS was introduced in August 2020, I negotiated a special arrangement for registered ELC and SAC services to be exempt from this turnover test and I can confirm that these special arrangements will be extended for Quarter 3 of 2021. Officials in my Department are engaging with the Department of Finance in the context of wider proposals for the EWSS in Quarter 4. </p><p>I recognise that early learning and care and school age childcare services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions. Given the substantial additional supports allocated to the sector, and the assurance that there will be no sudden withdrawal of Government supports, there is no case for an increase to fees paid by parents. </p><p>I might add that where providers require further financial assistance in addition to current supports available, my Department operates a Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme. This is additional to the existing financial supports for services. The purpose of the Covid-19  Impact support grant is to support the sustainability of ELC and SAC services who may be left with short-term sustainability concerns due to lower attendance or higher costs arising from COVID-19. This scheme will support services to remain open without increasing their Registered Fees to parents or guardians.</p><p>Funding is provided to successful applicants which have experienced an income/expenditure deficit in respect of the childcare aspect of their business/organisation, and do not have sufficient funds in reserve  to absorb this deficit. Funding is not available to replace all lost income; funding is available only to fill an actual shortfall where the applicant cannot meet all of their current operating costs. The funding will be available on a rolling basis throughout 2021 for eligible ELC and SAC services that require further financial assistance. The process for accessing this funding begins with the City/County Childcare Committees; any service that has concerns about their viability should therefore contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p><p>Looking to the future, my Department will be developing a new funding model for early learning and care and school age childcare that provides additional resourcing to services subject to quality and affordability. An Expert Group has been progressing this work since late 2019 and I expect their report to be finalised in November. An essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations on a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC/SAC in return for increased State investment in affordability, quality and sustainability, as set out in <i>First 5</i>. I anticipate that the Expert Group's work can contribute to informing the Budget 2022 process. </p><p>Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the work of the Group. Frontier Economics, the Research Partner, have produced and published eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the early learning and care sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents. This research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the new funding model. </p></reply>

The current campus facilities consist of two separate rented sites which offer little opportunity for expansion.  It has been a long term ambition of IT Carlow to secure a more suitable permanent campus site in Wexford. In the broader context of higher education progression and integration in the South East this is an objective I strongly support.  </p>  <p>  Should the application made by IT Carlow and WIT to establish a multi-campus TU serving the South East ultimately prove to be successful then any new campus of IT Carlow located in Wexford would, in turn, become a campus of the designated Technological University.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that IT Carlow submitted an updated business case to the HEA earlier this year for a site purchase in Wexford.  After a review of the business case, the HEA Board approved the proposal, including the value for money parameters.  The proposal has been further approved by me and by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in line with the THEA Code of Governance, which applies to Institutes of Technology. </p>  <p>  IT Carlow is now engaged in efforts to secure a site in line with the agreed parameters and has been liaising with Wexford County Council who are very supportive of the planned development. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, as the site acquisition process is ongoing, the details are commercially sensitive.

As of earlier this week, SUSI had received almost 74,000 applications from students. To date, almost 53,500 applications have been assessed with over 47,000 assessed as eligible for support for the next academic year.</p><p>As in any statutory scheme, a core principle is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process.</p><p>This applies to people who are dependent on different types of social protection payment.</p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income since it was introduced in March 2020 . Income from the Covid-19 payment therefore has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance. </p><p>This means that a student or a family on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment should be treated in the same way as a student or a family who are dependent on Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance. The holiday earnings disregard does not apply to these social protection payments, and it would not be fair or equitable to apply a different approach to the PUP.  </p><p>However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision.  </p><p>If an applicant or a family member has experienced a change in circumstances during 2021, then they can apply to SUSI for their application to be assessed or reassessed under a change in circumstances.  </p><p>Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p><p>The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19.</p><p>I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p><p>A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p><p>However, there are points at which a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student. These are where he/she: </p><p>-  Progresses from further education to higher education.  </p><p>-  Is returning following a 3 year break in studies.  </p><p>-  Is returning as a &quot;second chance&quot; student after a five year break in studies.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for student grant applications is a matter for the centralised grant awarding authority, SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland).</p><p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI and subsequently to the Student Grants Appeals Board within the statutory timeframes.</p><p>Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: susi.ie/eligibility/applicant-class/ </p><p>The scheme operates in the context of competing educational priorities and limited public funding. The aim of the scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college. The existing rules reflect the fact that very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents, where their parents have sufficient means, while in full-time education. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government, a review of the Student Grant Scheme is currently underway and is due to report in Autumn 2021.  A public consultation process closed in April with over 280 submissions received. The views of students were sought via an online survey process in May and over 9,000 survey responses were received. It is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-07-08a.754.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021070800091#WRM06700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277, 283, 294 and 296 together.</p><p>The further and higher education sectors have a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure that the educational opportunities being offered align with existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified higher education graduates and apprentices, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands.</p><p>The identification of skills priorities to help inform and shape planning for graduate output from higher and further education, including in relation to apprenticeships, is guided by the National Skills Strategy. The Strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, the National Skills Council and the nine Regional Skills Fora. Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in Solas and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.  The detailed research and analyses carried out by these bodies feed into the work of the Skills Council in defining the priorities and delivering responses in the area of skills needs.</p><p>Two key initiatives in the higher education system which ensure that places are funded in courses in identified areas of skills need are Springboard + and the Human Capital Initiative (HCI). Springboard+ 2021 was launched on 14th June 2021. As a result of multi-annual funding of graduate conversion courses, there is a combined total of 13,444 places on 408 courses available in the 2021/22 academic year under Springboard+ 2021 and HCI Pillar 1. This year, there is a broad range of courses, including courses in areas of new and emerging technologies such Cybersecurity, and Virtual Reality. In addition, there are programmes in areas which have come to the fore as result of Covid-19 such as Health Innovation, Logistics and Online Retail. </p><p>The new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 which was launched on 19th April last sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. A key strength of the apprenticeship model, is that it is a demand-led approach to meeting workforce and skill requirements in our economy. Therefore the number of places is determined by employers with off the job training delivered to all registered apprentices.  </p><p>Of the 61 apprenticeship programmes currently available, leading to qualifications at level 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications, eight are at level 7; five are at level 8; three programmes are at level 9 and the Principal Engineer (post graduate) programme is at level 10.  There are a further 17 apprenticeships in development of which 5 are expected to be offered at level 7 and 4 at level 9.</p><p>It is important to note that the off the job training for the phases 4 and 6 of the 25 craft apprenticeships is delivered Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. </p><p>A full list of the available apprenticeship programmes, the apprenticeship programmes in development, and their NFQ level are available in the attached spreadsheet. </p><p>My Department will continue working with enterprise agencies and industry groups, as well as the higher education institutions, to assess the future demand for higher education graduates and apprentices as well as our ability to meet this demand, and ensure we are prepared for the challenges ahead. <table>

The availability of top talent is and will continue to be one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest assets as we compete globally to be a world-leading knowledge-driven economy. </p>  <p>  I and my department are determined to be the driver of a vibrant sector which produces individuals who are equipped with the skills that they need to progress in the way that they want to, and in a way that meets the needs of our evolving economy and contributes to an inclusive society. Not only will these individuals be equipped with expertise in research and innovation but I am also determined that the sector will continue to embrace and embed innovation in how it delivers and operates.</p>  <p>  As international competition for talent, investment and innovation grows more intense as nations strive to improve their standing as knowledge-based economies, the establishment of a new department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society. </p>  <p>  It is imperative that we continue to develop a pipeline of research talent if Ireland is to realise its ambitions under the Economic Recovery Plan and the forthcoming revised National Development Plan, and my officials will be exploring this as part of the development of the next National Research and Innovation Strategy currently underway at my department.</p>  <p>  This new strategy will aim to be transformative in meeting societal, economic and global challenges. It will identify the reforms necessary to develop an R&amp;I system that has the right capacity and capabilities, and which is supported by coherent policies and structures for national coordination, collaboration and governance across the national R&amp;I landscape. </p>  <p>  My department is also embarking on the Creating our Future campaign, delivered by Science Foundation Ireland. Creating our Future is a conversation with the people of Ireland to gather their ideas on what research and innovation they believe could be undertaken to address their challenges and create a better future for all. Broader public engagement about research and innovation will ensure that Ireland can key societal and economic challenges and adapt to new industries and economic models.</p></reply>

Having the right skills approaches in the workplace, as well as in third level institutions across the country, is what will underpin performance, productivity, profits, outcomes, human capability and, crucially, people&rsquo;s sense of purpose and wellbeing. </p><p>A fundamental principle in achieving that goal is engagement with stakeholders - including enterprise and education and training providers.</p><p>The National Skills Council  is one of the key partnership structures for my Department. It is made up of high level representatives from the public and private sectors,  including from enterprise,  from the Higher Education Authority and from Education and Training Boards Ireland. The Council aims to bring together &ldquo;the various inputs to prioritisation of provision to meet skills demands&hellip; to oversee research, advise on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of identified needs&hellip; [and to take a key] role in promoting and reporting on the delivery of responses by education and training providers to those priorities.&rdquo; The Council is currently chaired by Bob Savage, Vice President, Regional Chief Information Officer for EMEA and Cork Site Leader Dell Technologies. </p><p>Recent meetings have invited speakers from private enterprise, the EU Commission and the OECD. Topics discussed recently include the impact of COVID-19 on the future world of work, remote working and regional development. Labour market intelligence and skills forecasting entities, including the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit of SOLAS  and the National Training Fund Advisory Group, inform the discussions of the Council.</p><p>In addition,  the network of Regional Skills Fora  seek to bring people together at local and regional level, to identify, interrogate and validate skills needs, and to ensure that employers / enterprise are linked to the right places, to get responses they need. The Fora provide hugely valuable bottom-up information and insights, which feed into the work of the NSC, and the broader work to ensure that we have a skills agenda, at national level, that is evidence-informed and is serving its purpose for people across the country.</p><p>The education system needs to be agile and responsive and the needs of all sectors must be considered. It will be important to move away from the concept of &ldquo;low skilled&rdquo; jobs.  These are the jobs that kept the country going during the pandemic, we now need to look at ways to build on the skills of the people in those sectors to ensure that they have sustainable skills for employment.  It will be important to equip people with technical skills but also with the social and emotional skills to help them navigate the change. </p><p>In order to mitigate the economic and social impact of the pandemic and to make the Irish economy and society more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the green and digital transitions, investing in lifelong learning and skills development for the future world of work, via opportunities that are modular, flexible and in blended formats and that can be combined to attain full qualifications are priorities for my Department. </p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched on 19th April and sets out a five year plan which sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.  The Plan promotes access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship by offering targeted supports to encourage participation from young people and under-represented groups such as women, those with disabilities and those from ethnic minority backgrounds. </p><p>Budget 2021 provided for almost &euro;200m funding from the NTF for apprenticeship.  This included the cost of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme from Jan-Jun 2021 as well as &euro;12m towards additional measures designed to reduce the waiting lists arising from Covid-19 measures within the apprenticeship system.  In addition &euro;20M in capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period.</p><p>Further Education and Training (FET) provides a diverse range of programmes and supports designed to meet the needs of individuals at different stages of the learning pathway. Courses focused on foundation or transversal skills development, including literacy and numeracy and digital skills, build the core capabilities that allow participants to move on to more advanced learning opportunities. A range of programmes are focused more formally on facilitating pathways to other education and training opportunities and often bridge the gap between foundational learning and accessing vocationally focused programmes. These vocational programmes focus on providing skills that enable direct progression to the workplace, while also enabling pathways into higher education. Vocational programmes typically have a strong work-based component.  This is strongest in the areas of apprenticeship, where learners are employed by companies from the outset of the programme.  </p><p><b><i>Skills to Advance </i></b></p><p>Launched in 2018 by SOLAS, Skills to Advance is an employee development policy framework which enables targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce, with a particular focus on employees who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy also supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who need assistance to invest in and develop their workforce. Skills to Advance is delivered through the network of 16 Education and Training Boards located around Ireland. A total of 10,318 participants took part in the Skills to Advance in 2020. The provisional figure for individuals participating in 2021 is 9,059.</p><p><b><i>Skills to Compete</i></b></p><p>In response to the urgent need for activation, upskilling and reskilling as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, SOLAS &ndash; in partnership with the Department of Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) and the 16 ETBs, and with input from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) and industry representatives &ndash; has developed the Skills to Compete initiative. This initiative is delivered through ETBs, including through contracted training, and works in tandem with INTREO offices, Regional Skills Fora, and Enterprise Ireland to effectively target individuals who may have been displaced from their employment as a result of Covid-19. Courses offered under the initiative are built around three key priorities: delivering the essential skills required for modern workplaces; building strong digital skills; and developing the specific vocational skills to secure opportunities in growing sectors and occupations. There have been over 11,000 enrolments on Skills to Compete programmes to date. </p><p><b><i>eCollege</i></b></p><p>SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority of Ireland, has significantly increased the capacity of its online service, eCollege. eCollege is now available free of charge as a support to any citizen who has been impacted by the current containment measures. eCollege provides online courses, including computer programming, data science, office productivity and web and graphic design. eCollege is online 24/7 so people can study at any time that suits them.

Further education and training (FET) opportunities offered through Skills to Advance incorporate digital, socio-emotional and technical skills development to enhance employee skills and support increased productivity in Irish SMEs. </p>  <p>  As part of the Skills to Advance initiative, SOLAS created the Innovation through Collaboration Fund specifically to support collaborative partnerships by ETBs with the private sector, researchers and academics to meet the skills needs for innovation across economic sectors. Two of ten Innovation through Collaboration projects focus on specific challenges in manufacturing; delivering up-to-the-minute skills using flexible delivery methods, and recognising the existing skills and competencies of technicians while providing upskilling pathways for an increasingly digitised workplace. A new call for this fund is due to be issued in July 2021. </p>  <p>  A capital investment programme in the FET sector is also being rolled out. Among the priorities being addressed are funding for infrastructure and equipment to support reskilling and upskilling needs.</p>  <p>  In the Higher Education sector, the Human Capital Initiative is an innovative approach to the provision of additional capacity across the system to meet priority skills needs for enterprise. The Initiative forms a key part of the strategic response to a changing world of work and the challenges the economy will face in the period ahead. With a strong focus on innovation and agility, the programmes being supported will ensure that graduates and the education system as a whole, are in a position to respond positively to the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>  <p>  HCI Pillar 3 of the HCI is an innovation and agility fund that commands a total budget of &euro;197 million over a five-year period. It will deliver 22 projects in higher education institutions. The projects include the use of virtual laboratories in higher education, a new hub to upskill the building sector on green construction, and the establishment of Creative Futures Academy to support digital and screen culture, cinema, literature and broadcasting, art, design, and fashion.</p>  <p>  Through the projects recommended under this pillar, it is intended that innovative methods of teaching and delivery will be promoted, so that learners will benefit from improved quality and more engaging ways of learning on enterprise-focused courses. The capacity of institutions to anticipate, understand and respond to emerging skills needs of enterprise will be increased, together with the ability of institutions to provide lifelong learning and upskilling opportunities for all.</p></reply>

These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department is also embarking on the Creating our Future campaign, delivered by Science Foundation Ireland. Creating our Future is a conversation with the people of Ireland to gather their ideas on what research and innovation they believe could be undertaken to address their challenges and create a better future for all. Broader public engagement about research and innovation will ensure that Ireland can address key societal and economic challenges and adapt to new industries and economic models.</p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is leading the development of the new national research and innovation strategy, in consultation with key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders from across the research and innovation community. This new Department has been established with a clear mandate to work with all stakeholders to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s research and innovation ecosystem, drive reform and collaboration, and enhance outcomes which contribute to meeting societal, economic and global challenges.</p>  <p>  This new strategy will aim to be transformative in meeting these challenges. It will identify the reforms necessary to develop a research and innovation system that has the right capacity and capabilities, and which is supported by coherent policies and structures for national coordination, collaboration and governance across the national R&amp;I landscape. </p>  <p>  As was the case in the previous national research and innovation strategy, Innovation 2020, we will remain committed to maintaining and improving standards in the excellence of our research.  Support for excellent research across all disciplines (including arts, humanities and the social sciences as well as science, technology, engineering and maths) is essential. This is reflected in the core values of my Department&rsquo;s agencies. </p>  <p>  The mission of the Irish Research Council is to support excellence in research talent, knowledge and engagement. Its core value is research excellence: across all disciplines, determined on the basis of independent peer review, in an open, objective, transparent and trusted manner. Science Foundation Ireland funds excellent and impactful research and talent, and shapes the future of Ireland through anticipating what's next and widening engagement and collaboration.</p>  <p>  As testament to this drive for excellence, since 2009, Ireland has been listed among the top 20 countries in global rankings for the quality of our scientific research. As published in the most recent SFI Annual Report, based on InCites Essential Science Indicators from Clarivate Analytics, Ireland ranks 12th in global scientific ranking (for scientific paper citations), including 1st in the world in Immunology, 2nd in Agricultural sciences, 5th in Neuroscience, 5th in Material sciences, 9th in Molecular biology and genetics and 9th in Microbiology.</p></reply>

However projections of full-time enrolment at third level predict that full-time post-graduate enrolments will rise by at least a further 10% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. The number of students graduating from post-graduate courses each year has increased from 19,100 in 2014 to 24,750 in 2019, an increase of almost 30% in five years.</p><p>The new Action Plan for Apprenticeship sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  This compares against a 2019 registration figure of 6,177, and a 2020 registration figure of 5,326 as registrations were impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>My Department will continue to align our further and higher education policies with what is required in the workplace to meet the needs of the economy. We will do this by working with industry to address current needs and, looking beyond the current world of work, by equipping individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the changing labour market.</p></reply>

These surveys will be conducted by researchers at the DCU National Anti-Bullying Centre. </p>  <p>  The third level student cohort remains largely overlooked at research, policy and practice level and the lack of comprehensive and current data documenting the extent of the problem presents a barrier to both understanding and addressing the issue. Research on workplace bullying in our Higher Education Institutions is also lacking and little is known on this phenomenon within the Irish context. Given the negative effects of workplace bullying in terms of physical and psychological wellbeing, student learning, organisational culture, and organisational costs, it is paramount to investigate this phenomenon and implement prevention and intervention programmes. </p>  <p>  The aim of the surveys is to gain a deeper understanding into the experiences of bullying among and between Higher Education staff and students in Ireland, including the current prevalence, nature and effects of these issues.

A wide range of factors are taken into account, including the promotion of business and trade and facilitating people who wish to come to Ireland to work or study.  However, there are a number of other factors that also must be taken into consideration when any change to the visa regime is contemplated. </p>  <p>  The Government's policy is to pursue a strategy of greater co-ordination and co-operation on visa issues with the United Kingdom (UK) in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and the future expansion of the British-Irish Visa scheme.  This scheme, which is agreed on a country by country basis, enables short stay visa holders to travel freely within the CTA.  As part of this greater co-operation, the matter of alignment of those States whose citizens are visa required is an important consideration.  The greater the extent of alignment between the two jurisdictions, the greater the opportunity to increase the numbers of tourism and business visits to the CTA.  </p>  <p>  At the present time, both Ireland and the UK require Colombian citizens to be in possession of a visa and any proposals for change will be considered in this context.  This is of course kept under review and my Department has committed to a review when the current pandemic is over.  </p>  <p>  The visa fee is an non-refundable fee which covers the cost of administration to process an application. Some applicants, such as family members of Irish citizens and qualifying family members of EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, are exempt from visa fees. It is also the case that some nationalities are exempt from the requirement to pay the visa fee. In the case where a visa fee is payable, I am informed that the same fee is payable by all nationalities. The current visa fees are:</p>  <p>  -  &euro;60: Single entry - Short stay &ldquo;C&rdquo; visa or long stay &ldquo;D&rdquo; visa</p>  <p>  -  &euro;100: Multiple entry - Short stay 'C' visa or long stay &ldquo;D&rdquo; visa</p>  <p>  Regardless of nationality, all applicants must satisfy the Visa Officer that a visa should be granted for the purpose sought. The applicant must show that they have sufficient funds to support their stay in Ireland. There is a different set of higher financial criteria which must be met to obtain a study visa but this is in no way related to the nationality of the applicant. I am informed that the proof of economic solvency for all applicants of all visa required nationals is identical.</p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection considerations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open for applications from all counties. 34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties and I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. Further details are available to download from the Department of Justice website - www.justice.ie - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address, fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 38(3)(c)) and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework sets out a number of safeguards, requiring that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have operated since 2006.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. This bill will also cover CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. I intend to conduct a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems.  When enacted, this legislation will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></reply>

This has enabled sustained ongoing recruitment into the organisation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.</p>  <p>  However, I am assure that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 31 May 2021, there is currently one designated Community Garda assigned to the Mallow district, who is one of 7 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork North Division.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those officers who are exclusively assigned to particular community engagement tasks.  In overall terms, however, community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In this regard, as at 31 May 2021, there were 116 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Mallow District, which represents an increase of 17% since 2015. These Garda members are supported by 7 Garda staff.</p></reply>

The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland -  that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone.  It will be best achieved as a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; responsibility with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves.  The Local Community Safety Partnerships will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. </p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities as well as local councillors. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that in November 2020, Minister McEntee announced the establishment of three new Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p></reply>

Further redeployment of sworn Garda members to frontline policing duties, where their skills, training and expertise can be of most use, is continuing in line with these changes. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods. Garda&iacute; target serious criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly liaises and cooperates with their international policing and security partners, such as EUROPOL and INTERPOL, in their mutual objective of combatting transnational organised crime. </p><p>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics. However, the particular breakdown sought by the Deputy is not available, as 'drug related crime' covers a wide range of criminal activity from drug trafficking to assault and intimidation.

While I recognise that there is no quick fix to reducing recidivism, targeted interventions, particularly in the community, will result in better outcomes for the most marginalised offenders. These include increasing access to addiction treatment, employment opportunities and increased use of community funded organisations. </p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2021 outlines a range of actions to progress this. Among those is the forthcoming publication of a Review on Penal Policy, which will set out actions to be taken going forward in order to reduce the rate of reoffending.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). Community Return and Community Support Schemes aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending. The J-ARC is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which targets prolific offenders responsible for large amounts of crime. The Action Plan for the Joint Management of Offenders (2019-2021) further aims to reduce reoffending of sex offenders, perpetrators of domestic abuse and prolific offenders (including violent and other serious anti-social offenders). The Department, Probation Service, IPS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have developed a focused framework to work collaboratively to manage such offenders in prison and in the community. </p>  <p>  In terms of statistical trends in regards to recidivism, 2 recent publications from the CSO will be of interest to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  One published on 17 November 2020 provides information on the level of recorded re-offending by offenders that were placed under the management of the Probation Service, including those on Community Service Orders. The second report published on 25 June examines re-offending levels amongst prisoners released from the Prison Service. </p>  <p>  Both reports can be found on the website of the CSO. </p>  <p>  In relation the CSO report on re-offending by offenders that were placed under the management of the Probation Service, it is encouraging to note that reoffending rates decreased over the period covered by the report. The Probation Service remains committed to supporting the sustained reduction of recidivism through the delivery of its offender rehabilitation and supervision schemes, and continues to work closely with partners within the Justice ecosystem to support the successful reintegration of those who have committed crimes safely back into their communities. </p>  <p>  As regards the statistics contained in the report examining reoffending levels amongst those released from Prison, while it is encouraging to see that no significant upward trends are occurring, it is clear that we still have much work to do in this area. </p>  <p>  Examples of recent initiatives intended to support reintegration of offenders and reduce reoffending include:</p>  <p>  -  The Criminal Justice Sector Housing First Project which was initiated in October last year to deliver on a commitment contained in the Housing First National Implementation Plan 2018-2021 by securing housing with time unlimited multi-disciplinary supports for 75 people leaving prison custody or under probation supervision in the community. </p>  <p>  -  The Working to Change: Social Enterprise and Employment Strategy 2021-2023 launched last year sets out the Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by working to remove the systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. </p>  <p>  -  The new Youth Justice Strategy which is an important element in the State&rsquo;s policy response to the involvement of children and young people in crime and is designed to provide a development framework to address key ongoing challenges, as well as new and emerging issues in the youth Justice area. This will include preventing offending behaviour from occurring and diverting children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement in the criminal justice system. </p>  <p>  -  The establishment of the High Level Task Force on Mental Health which is considering how best to care for people with mental health issues who come into contact with the criminal justice system. The Task Force has already met twice and has established a number of sub-groups which are focusing in the first instance on effective diversion from the criminal justice system; along with capacity levels in the Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service; and also at community care and through-care from custody.</p>  <p>  We are also working to reform our spent convictions legislation to broaden the range of convictions that are considered spent in order to offer opportunities to individuals who have demonstrated that they wish to move away from offending and into employment by offering them an important &lsquo;second chance&rsquo;.</p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. I have made enquiries in relation to the data requested by the Deputy and I am advised that the information sought is not readily available. </p>  <p>  However, in general terms, the Deputy may be interested to note that the Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Act also provides for the Court to have the power, in certain circumstances, to hear evidence from the victim of an alleged offence before a decision on bail is taken. </p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and increases the use of curfews.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and I can inform the Deputy there are no immediate plans to introduce further bail legislation.  </p></reply>

Therefore, the Irish Prison Service has no control over the numbers committed to custody at any given time. </p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that the prison system has always been subject to peaks and troughs. The number of persons in custody peaked in February 2011 at 4,621, before falling back to 3,525 in January 2015. However, since 2016, the number of persons in custody had been steadily increasing until March 2020 when this trend was ended with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  As part of its response to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic in custodial settings, since March 2020 the Prison Service has been implementing measures to reduce the prison population, in order to ensure good infection control and to ensure that cells are available for the accommodation of any prisoner who may be required to isolate in accordance with guidance from the public health authorities.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, the approach adopted included granting temporary release to low risk prisoners who were serving sentences of less than 12 months for non-violent offences. Subsequently, prisoners assessed as low risk who had less than 6 months to serve were also granted temporary release from some prisons.</p>  <p>  In 2019, in response to increasing prisoner numbers, the Director General introduced a Prison Population Management Plan aimed at identifying the short, medium and long term actions required to address the rising prisoner numbers. As a result, approximately 135 additional beds were introduced. The current bed capacity of the prison estate is 4,375.  </p>  <p>  A further 96 prisoner spaces will come on stream in due course (subject to easing of restrictions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic) with the reopening of the Training Unit at Mountjoy as an older persons facility. In addition, the construction of a new male wing and standalone female prison is underway in Limerick Prison and will provide 90 additional male and 40 additional female spaces. It is subject to delays due to Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that the number in custody on 6 July, 2021 was 3,866, representing a 88% occupancy rate.</p></reply>

This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I further understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, Garda numbers are now approximately 14,500 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  </p><p>Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant<b></b>capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. This will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that roll-out by the Garda Commissioner of the new Garda Operating Model has begun and meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>This new Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on Garda&iacute; being out visibly on patrol, engaging with communities, preventing crime and supporting victims. As part of the reduction of bureaucracy and streamlining of administrative processes, the number of Garda Regions and Divisions is being reduced and additional power will be devolved to local level so as to enable the delivery of better and more localised policing services nationwide. The general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Amendment)(No.2) Bill has been approved by Government to facilitate the full roll out of the new operating model.</p></reply>

The rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. When forests are young the sequestration rate is low but as the trees mature their ability to sequester carbon dioxide increases. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Teagasc launched their new Forest Carbon Tool with the support of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This online tool can be used to calculate how much carbon dioxide can be removed by woodlands and highlights the important role of harvested wood products. For example, if one hectare of land is afforested with oak it has the potential to remove 2.31 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually per rotation over the first and subsequent rotations, whereas Sitka spruce has the potential to remove 8.32 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually per rotation over the first and subsequent rotations. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that although forests of different species sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at different rates the about of carbon stored in forests is generally broadly similar over time. </p>  <p>  Further information can be found on the Teagasc website at www.teagasc.ie/crops/forestry/advice/environment/forest-carbon-tool/.</p></reply>

Last month was the highest month of the year so far with 411 licences issuing. It is not possible to say at this stage how many afforestation licences will issue in July. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, along with my colleague Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for forestry, I remain committed to issuing 4,500 forestry licences this year, which is an increase of 75% on 2020. </p>  <p>  To the 2nd July, 1,814 licences have already issued, with 115 licences issued last week. Of these 303 were afforestation licences, for 2,629ha.  This is 7% up on 2020, in terms of the number of licences issued and an increase of  23%  on the area licensed.  The 4,500 licences issued will comprise of Afforestation, Forest Road and Felling licences. </p>  <p>  Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has been set up with the objective of reviewing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, as well as the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy. </p>  <p>  Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group  has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system. </p>  <p>  While these initiatives are being developed, the Department continues to pursue continual improvement.  We have recently reviewed the  systems for the preparation of Appropriate Assessment Screening Determinations, Appropriate Assessment Reports and Appropriate Assessment Determinations.  Improvements have been made to the system to optimise the time of the ecologists to concentrate on the ecology aspects of each application.  </p>  <p>  Currently, these improvements are only applied to private tree felling licence (TFL) applications, which has already yielded results with increased licences issued.  The ecologists are working mostly on these felling applications in advance of the system being developed further to assist with forest road works and afforestation licence applications.  These developments will take place over the coming weeks and I expect to see similar increases in afforestation licences issuing. </p>  <p>  I believe that the framework now in place under Project Woodland, supported by my Department's commitment to continual improvement, will deliver on its objectives and I am hopeful that this will provide encouragement to farmers and landowners to go into forestry, or to realise the planting licences they have already received which comprises 5,500ha, and to avail of the attractive premiums available under the Department&rsquo;s Schemes.</p></reply>

The Department has supported the development of a National Soil Carbon Observatory to be run by Teagasc and which will improve significantly our knowledge in this area measuring the movement of carbon in our farms. I also recently announced a scheme for farmers to conduct soil testing at farm level which will develop our knowledge at individual farm level.</p>  <p>  Under the current EU Effort Sharing Regulation, Ireland was granted a flexibility to use land use removals as a contribution towards our national emissions reduction target out to 2030. </p>  <p>  Carbon sequestration by forests is influenced by a range of factors including species, soil type, site conditions and management practices. When forests are young, the sequestration rate is low but as the trees mature their ability to sequester carbon dioxide increases. Earlier this year, Teagasc launched their new Forest Carbon Tool, a user-friendly way to calculate how much carbon can be removed in woodlands. For example, one hectare of oak has the potential to remove 2.31 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually per rotation over the first and subsequent rotations, whereas Sitka spruce has the potential to remove 8.32 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually per rotation over the first and subsequent rotations.</p>  <p>  I remain in close contact with my cabinet colleague, Minister Eamon Ryan, to ensure that the emission reduction targets for agriculture under the Climate Amendment Bill are achievable. As the Deputy will be aware, this legislation is in the final stages of clearing both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

It is the fourth largest agri-food sector accounting for 6.3% of the total agri-food output. The sector supports approximately 8,000 jobs spanning production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services and has played a key role in meeting targets set out in Food Wise 2025.</p><p>The submission referred to is detailed and covers a range of issues including animal welfare and environmental issues. This submission is being considered within the Department. </p><p>In the meantime, I would like to highlight that given the strategic importance in which the sector plays in our agri economy, and on foot of the work of the Pig Industry Implementation Group (PISG), a new format for stakeholder engagement was established earlier this year, the Pig Roundtable. The Pig Roundtable's focus is on key strategic developments in the sector, determined primarily by high level strategic drivers including the Programme for Government and the new Agri Food Strategy to 2030. </p><p>It will serve as a conduit for constructive engagement and to enable the Department to work in tandem with industry and farming partners in delivering on both the opportunities available and challenges faced by the sector. Membership of the group includes pig farmers, farm and processing sector representative bodies, Teagasc, Bord Bia and officials from the Department.</p><p>At the inaugural meeting of the Roundtable which was held on the 28<sup>th</sup>April 2021, with my colleague Minister of State Martin Heydon as Chair, it was agreed that the group will meet quarterly with each meeting centered around a key specific theme for the sector.</p><p>The next meeting is scheduled for 28<sup>th</sup>July 2021 and the agreed theme is animal welfare, which aligns with many of the issues raised in the submission. Alongside the Pig Roundtable, officials continue to liaise closely with the representative bodies on key issues.</p></reply>
