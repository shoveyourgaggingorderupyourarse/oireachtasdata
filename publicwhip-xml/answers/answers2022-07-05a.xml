FLAC plays a key role in the provision of legal information, advice and advocacy work and regularly engages with my Department on access to justice matters.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides substantial annual funding to FLAC to ensure that it can continue its important work helping people with legal problems. In Budget 2021 I trebled the funding for FLAC's telephone information referral line and I maintained that level of funding for this year. Their Annual Report notes that last year the highest number of calls were made to the referral line since 2015, with over 13,000 calls. </p>  <p>  The Annual Report also highlights an unmet legal need particularly in the areas of family and employment law. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a review of the civil legal aid scheme, which FLAC has called a very significant moment in the history of access to justice. </p>  <p>  FLAC is an important member of the Review Group and its insights from working to promote equal access to justice for all will be invaluable to the Group as its work progresses.</p>  <p>  The review will allow for an assessment of how well access to justice is facilitated by our Civil Legal Aid Scheme, particularly for those on low incomes. The Review Group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility.</p>  <p>  The Review Group is chaired by the former Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, and follows on from the work he has previously led under the Chief Justice's Access to Justice Working Group. The Review Group has commenced its work, which is expected to take a period of 12 months. It will report periodically on the progress of its work, before submitting its final report to me once its work is completed.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme is part of a broader civil justice reform programme that I am spearheading across my Justice Plan 2022.</p>  <p>  FLAC&rsquo;s Annual Report highlighted that in 2021 almost a third of all queries to its Telephone Information and Referral Line related to family law matters. I am determined to overhaul the operation of the Family Justice System, to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work. Work on drafting the Family Court Bill is progressing with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500058#WRA01300"><p>I have noted the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the General Data Protection Regulation. As the Deputy will be aware, many of its 17 recommendations are directed to the Data Protection Commission itself. </p>  <p>  Under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, the Commission is independent in the performance of its tasks and the exercise of its powers. </p>  <p>  It does not report to me or my Department, nor has my Department any oversight or enforcement powers in relation to the Commission. The Commission operates under its own Vote, since January 2020, with its own accounting officer and lays its reports and accounts directly before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to &lsquo;recognise the domestic and international importance of data protection in Ireland&rsquo; and states that the Government &lsquo;will ensure that Ireland delivers on its responsibilities under the General Data Protection Regulation&rsquo;. The Government is very conscious of the commitment to deliver effective data protection regulation and protection of the data privacy rights of EU citizens, which is critical to the development and growth of our digital economy. In dialogue with the Commission, and with other relevant Government Departments, my Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that it continues to have the resources required to fulfil its important, statutory obligations, under on-going review.</p>  <p>  The existence of a professional and competent data protection regulator in Ireland is also a critical enabler to the development and growth of our digital economy. To support this, there has been a year-on-year increase in funding for the Commission over the last four budgetary years. This year, the total allocation for the Commission is &euro;23 million &ndash; a six-fold increase compared to 2015.</p>  <p>  Recognising the expanding breadth of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory role, its mission to safeguard data protection rights, and the increasing demands, this increased budgetary allocation to the Commission in 2022 will enable the recruitment of additional specialist and technical staff and address the increasing case load and complexity of cases being faced by the Commission. </p>  <p>  Under the 2018 Act, provision is made that the Government may determine that the Commission could consist of up to three members. I asked my officials to consider the matter of appointing additional commissioners. Department officials have made a recommendation and this is now under consideration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500058#WRA02300"><p>I want to say at the outset, that acts of violence and anti-social behaviour are completely unacceptable. There are a number of tools at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner, who is operationally responsible, to respond to such incidents. The Commissioner is also responsible, as the Deputy will be aware, for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes the establishment of any operational policing units within the Garda&iacute;. As Minister I have no role in these independent functions.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Commissioner has no current plans to introduce a dedicated transport police unit, as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's mission of 'Keeping People Safe' extends to all areas of our communities, including public transport. Garda management engages extensively with transport operators, including the National Transport Authority, Irish Rail (DART and InterCity rail) and Transdev Ireland (Luas) to provide a high visibility presence through a coordinated approach. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to prevent, pre-empt and detect incidents arising.</p>  <p>  For example, Operation Twin Tracks, a community engagement and rail safety policing initiative, is being conducted by Garda&iacute; in partnership with other public transportation stakeholders with the purpose of providing high visibility policing of rail and light rail transport within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and the rail networks and train stations nationwide, and to deliver crime prevention advice to rail and light rail users. A day of action was held on 3 June, with a second day planned for 29 July. </p>  <p>  High visibility patrolling operates between the hours of 3pm and 11pm on each day within the Dublin Region (Connolly and Heuston Stations) and nationwide on eight intercity routes. Local Crime Prevention Officers and Community Policing Garda&iacute; are available to deliver crime prevention advice at community engagement/crime prevention stands at a number of stations from 3pm to 8pm on each of the days. </p>  <p>  In January this year, the Garda authorities also launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen, the Garda operation to reassure people that Dublin City Centre is a safe place to visit.  Operation Saul aims to provide a safe environment for commuters using public transport services in the City.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Irene commenced in the DMR on 1 June 2022 and continues until 31 August 2022. It is a targeted operation to combat under-age alcohol consumption and the consumption of alcohol in public places in the DMR, through the enforcement of legislation regulating the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol and other associated legislation.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the deployment of Garda members throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimal use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2022 of over &euro;2 billion. The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 31 May 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 64 members assigned to the Clonakilty district, 103 assigned to the Bandon district, and 53 assigned to the Bantry district. This represents an increase of almost 7%, 1% and 10% respectively when compared to 30 June 2016 when there were 60 members assigned to the Clonakilty district, 102 assigned to the Bandon district, and 48 assigned to the Bantry district. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2020, there were 72 assigned to Clonakilty, 107 assigned to Bandon and 54 assigned to Bantry. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also had an exceptional impact across the country over the past two years.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, detailed statistics on Garda workforce numbers are published on my Department's website and updated on a monthly basis.</p></reply>

I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2022 of over &euro;2 billion. The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 31 May 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 322 Garda members assigned to the Mayo Division. This represents an increase of over 7% since the end of 2016, when there were 300 Garda members assigned to the Division. At the end of 2020, there were 343 members assigned to the Mayo Division. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also had an exceptional impact across the country over the past two years.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, detailed statistics on Garda workforce numbers are published on my Department's website and updated on a monthly basis.</p></reply>

The Forum is examining a broad range of issues, including knife crime, with a focus on developing measures which will address the factors which give rise to ASB and its impact on community morale and quality of life. </p><p>Members of the Forum are drawn from a number of State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and key Government Departments, as well as a broad representation of community, business, academic and other experts. </p><p>Minister Browne has convened two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p><p>  The knife crime sub-group has examined existing data and possible approaches to community responses as well as the legislative position. Minister Browne has been briefed on the work of the sub-group and is considering what further measures might be progressed.<b></b>My Department remains in contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service in this regard.</p><p>  It is important to note, based on international evidence, that there are no quick-fix solutions to tackling knife crime and it is clear that longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed. Knife crime cannot be addressed in isolation but as part of the strategic responses to address anti-social behaviour, street violence, youth offending and domestic violence.</p><p>My Department's overriding concern is that we pursue the actions which have the best chance of being effective and making a real difference. Therefore, we have to balance the strong impulse to react based on our shared outrage at violent crimes with a careful consideration of the best available evidence on what is most likely to yield real improvements.</p></reply>

APSFF is a living document which is reviewed and updated, as required, to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments, timeframes and milestones.</p><p>The Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office (PRIPO), which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach, monitors progress on APSFF, supports the work of the Implementation Group on Policing Reform (IGPR), and keeps the High-Level Steering Board on Policing Reform and Government apprised of progress being made.</p><p>While impacted as a result of the COVID-19, I can inform the Deputy that significant progress has been made on delivering on this very ambitious reform programme. </p><p>I understand that the Deputy is specifically seeking information around the new Garda Operating Model. This is one of the key APSFF projects and involves the transitioning into a new and modern Operating Model that seeks to reflect and address the realities of modern-day policing and to increase community engagement and access to a wider range of specialist services across the country.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the rollout of the Operating Model is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister for Justice, have no role in such matters.</p><p>The Operating Model will result a reduction in the number of Garda Divisions from the current 28 to 19 with a move to larger Divisions that have the critical mass to provide an effective and efficient policing service to the public.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that over 1,000 Garda personnel have been involved in the design and implementation of the Operating Model this year.</p><p>Each of the 19 Divisions will be comprised of four functional areas: community engagement, area crime, performance assurance and business service. I am pleased to see that the business service functional area has been fully implemented in a number of Divisions and good progress is being made on the performance assurance function.</p><p>Each of the functional areas will be led by a Superintendent, with the exception of business services which is led by an Assistant Principal. All services will be managed and coordinated at divisional as opposed to district level. All Garda stations will be aligned to the community engagement functional areas. Garda members and staff will continue to be geographically dispersed across the Division.</p><p>I am advised that to support Divisional implementation, a number of communication activities have been completed, including the publication of articles internally, operating model bulletins, divisional briefings and circulated communications materials and engagement with national staff associations and unions. In addition, there is a dedicated page on the internal Garda portal which includes relevant contact details for those seeking further information. All avenues provide for feedback and two-way communications on the project.</p><p>I am also advised that a Divisional Change Team has been established in each division currently rolling out the Operating Model. One of the key functions of this team is to provide for dedicated personnel with additional information to provide support and act as a point of reference locally. They are responsible for supporting and communicating to their peers as well as ensuring feedback is passed back up to local management and to sharing feedback from the Divisions with the national project team.</p><p>Furthermore, once services have been completely stood up within a Division, an evaluation is conducted, which includes consultation with frontline members.</p><p>I am confident that the continuing phased rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will greatly benefit the Garda organisation, supporting the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country, creating larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing. The model will also facilitate more effective streamlining of administrative processes and reduce bureaucracy.</p></reply>

FLAC plays a key role in the provision of legal information, advice and advocacy work and regularly engages with my Department on access to justice matters.  </p><p>  My Department also provides substantial annual funding to FLAC to ensure that it can continue its important work helping people with legal problems. In Budget 2021 I trebled the funding for FLAC's telephone information referral line and I maintained that level of funding for this year. Their Annual Report notes that last year the highest number of calls were made to the referral line since 2015, with over 13,000 calls. </p><p>  The Annual Report also highlights an unmet legal need particularly in the areas of family and employment law. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a review of the civil legal aid scheme, which FLAC has called a very significant moment in the history of access to justice.</p><p>  FLAC is an important member of the Review Group and its insights from working to promote equal access to justice for all will be invaluable to the Group as its work progresses.</p><p>The review will allow for an assessment of how well access to justice is facilitated by our Civil Legal Aid Scheme, particularly for those on low incomes. The Review Group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility.</p><p>  The Review Group is chaired by the former Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, and follows on from the work he has previously led under the Chief Justice's Access to Justice Working Group. The Review Group has commenced its work, which is expected to take a period of 12 months. It will report periodically on the progress of its work, before submitting its final report to me once its work is completed.</p><p>  The Review of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme is part of a broader civil justice reform programme that I am spearheading across my Justice Plan 2022.</p><p>  FLAC&rsquo;s Annual Report highlighted that in 2021 almost a third of all queries to its Telephone Information and Referral Line related to family law matters. I am determined to overhaul the operation of the Family Justice System, to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work. Work on drafting the Family Court Bill is progressing with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.</p></reply>

Some &euro;4.6 million has been allocated to more than 60 organisations providing supports and services across the country. </p>  <p>  This funding will provide support, information and advice on the rights of victims, as well as counselling services, court accompaniment and other accompaniment. </p>  <p>  The figure of &euro;4.6 million is an increase of over 20pc on the previous total fund of &euro;3.8 million which was made available in 2021.</p>  <p>  It also builds on separate, additional funding announced last November following the mapping exercise under the &lsquo;Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey&rsquo; plan for areas of the country or categories of victims not currently fully covered by support services for victims.</p>  <p>  As part of that mapping, a number of organisations were identified where additional funding would allow them to provide further services and to increase the geographical spread of support to victims of crime. </p>  <p>  The 2022 allocations cover national and larger organisations such as Barnardos, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre but also a range of local organisations working with victims across the country, including those in the Deputy&rsquo;s Constituency, such as Women&rsquo;s Aid Dundalk and Dundalk Counselling Service, both of which have seen substantial increases in their funding by my Department. </p>  <p>  The roll out of this funding is in addition to my ongoing work to support vulnerable victims through the implementation of Supporting a Victims Journey and in the recently launched Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</p></reply>

This commitment is shared by my colleagues in Government and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Kenova is a series of ongoing independent UK police investigations or reviews into Northern Ireland legacy cases. The legal distinction between investigations and reviews is important in this context.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to cooperating to the greatest extent possible with Kenova and already has in place a High Level Agreement which supports mutual co-operation and exchange of information with the Operation Kenova Investigation Team in the context of criminal investigations. The Historical Investigation Coordination Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support this work.</p>  <p>  Operation Denton is an ongoing independent analytical review by the Kenova Investigation Team into the activities of what was known as the Glenanne Gang in Northern Ireland. As Operation Denton is an analytical review being carried out in another jurisdiction rather than a formal criminal investigation, in order to achieve the strong desire of myself, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government to co-operate with Operation Denton to the maximum extent possible, it was necessary to obtain the advices of the Office of the Attorney General to confirm the available legal measures to facilitate Garda cooperation and the sharing of information. </p>  <p>  Following receipt of advices from the Attorney General, I sought and received Government approval on 21 June to create a dedicated cooperation mechanism, following which on 23 June I signed a directive under section 25(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act directing the identification and preparation for release of relevant records to Operation Denton.  My Department in consultation with the Attorney General is now preparing a regulation for my signature under the Data Protection Acts to facilitate the transfer of information to Operation Denton.

It may also be a precursor to acts of physical violence. Evidence suggests that having a specific offence leads to greater public awareness and to an increase in the number of cases being reported and prosecuted.</p><p>It is important to say that while these changes will improve the law, stalking is already a crime under the existing harassment offence. I would encourage victims of stalking to report it. It can be, and it is prosecuted. Offences carry a potential sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment and perpetrators should know they cannot act with impunity.</p><p>As I noted, the Government recently approved the drafting of these provisions and work in that regard is ongoing. The drafting of the text of the Bill in which they will be included is well advanced and is expected to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Taskforce is independently chaired by former Minister of State Kathleen Lynch. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce already held ten plenary meetings and established three subgroups on diversion, capacity issues in the Prison Service and National Forensic Mental Health Services, and community issues, including care after release. Each of the subgroups comprises relevant experts, chaired by high ranking officials from the criminal justice sector, with the health leads represented and contributing to all. Each of these subgroups have met on at least twelve occasions.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has engaged with a large number of relevant bodies and civil society actors, including meeting with the Mental Health Commission on 2 December 2021 and with the Chairperson of the National Prison Visiting Committees Chairpersons Group and with the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has also received presentations from relevant stakeholders including the Mental Health Commission, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and Crowe Consulting on the comprehensive Health Needs Assessment embarked on by the Prison Service.</p>  <p>  A key commitment of the terms of reference of the Taskforce is the delivery of a high-level implementation plan for any required actions arising from the groups work. The Taskforce has taken three thematic focuses which it considers capture the entirety of an individual&rsquo;s interactions with the criminal justice system.  These are: diversion of individuals with mental health difficulties and addiction/dual diagnosis issues away from the criminal justice system; the capacity of the Prison Service and the National Forensic Mental Health Service; and community issues including through care from custody. </p>  <p>  In examining issues and performance across each of these themes, the Taskforce hopes to be able to make positive changes at each point, before formal engagement in the criminal system, supporting rehabilitation of those in custody and ensuring the most successful reintegration into society.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce submitted its interim report on 22 November 2021.

If their appeal is also unsuccessful, or if they do not appeal, and they do not have another open application with my Department, other immigration options can be explored. </p>  <p>  However, anyone in the State without permission who needs to regularise their residency, but does not meet the terms of the published Scheme or who may have had another application refused, should contact my Department or their local immigration office and take all appropriate steps to regularise their status. Any application submitted should explain their current circumstances and future intentions in the State and provide any documentation they feel will support their application. </p>  <p>  A full consideration of all aspects of their case will be carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order. This will include a consideration of their private and family life rights, in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. A pragmatic approach is taken in relation to each case, which is considered on its individual merits.</p>  <p>  I encourage everyone eligible for the scheme, who has not yet made an application, to do so before the closing date at the end of July.</p></reply>

We are confident that the victim-centred policy approach we are taking will encourage more victims to come forward which will, in turn, strengthen prosecutions and convictions.</p><p>There are two areas of progress in particular that I wish to highlight.</p><p>The first is the approval by Government to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) and to place it on a statutory footing.</p><p>The NRM provides a way for all agencies, both State and civil society, to co-operate, share information about potential victims, identify those victims and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support.</p><p>Currently, when suspected victims of human trafficking are encountered by, or referred to, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na they are provided with a wide range of services by both the Government and NGOs through the NRM. It is widely accepted that having the Garda&iacute; as the sole competent authority for the formal recognition of people as victims of human trafficking is not the optimal system.</p><p>The new approach acknowledges other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to the NRM.</p><p>We want to be sure that every victim of trafficking is identified and helped so we can support them. Doing this is of course the right approach but it will also help us gather more information and evidence in order to bring to justice the traffickers who prey on vulnerable people with no regard for the lives and safety of their victims.</p><p>I also want to note the development of a new National Action Plan on human trafficking. </p><p>My Department engaged with a working group to draft the new National Action Plan high-level goals and outcomes. A draft Action Plan has been prepared and I intend to engage in a further round of stakeholder consultations before the plan is finalised and submitted to Government for approval in Q3 2022.</p><p>The Third National Strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence that I launched last week contains an action to identify linkages between the implementation plan accompanying the Strategy, and the National Action Plan on human trafficking, as well as ensuring actions to prevent prostitution and combat trafficking for sexual exploitation are addressed in an integrated manner.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a search of the PULSE database was conducted on 30 June 2022 to identify:</p><p>Any charges created since 1 January 2021 whereby an offence contrary to either the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 or the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 was referenced.</p><p>Any incident of PULSE category &ldquo;Human Trafficking&rdquo; which includes the following types:</p><p>- Labour Exploitation - Person Other Than A Child</p><p>- Sexual Exploitation - Person Other Than A Child</p><p>- Labour Exploitation Of A Child</p><p>- Sexual Exploitation Of A Child</p><p>- Soliciting or Importuning for Prostitution</p><p>- Other Offences</p><p>Any incident of PULSE category &lsquo;Miscellaneous&rsquo; and of type &lsquo;Human Trafficking Offences&rsquo;</p><p>The count of unique incidents and charges for full year 2021 and year to date, 29 June 2022 is as follows. <table>    <tr>       <th>Type </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2022 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incidents </td>       <td>52 </td>       <td>69 </td>       <td>42 </td>       <td>68 </td>       <td>51 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Charges </td>       <td>119 </td>       <td>* </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>27 </td>       <td>* </td>    </tr> </table> * Figures less than 10 are not reported to ensure there are no issues from a data protection perspective.</p><p>Information provided is taken from PULSE as of 30 June 2022, it is operational and may be liable to change. Crime counting rules are not applied to reflect all recorded incidents. There may be more than one charge on a single incident. </p></reply>

A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>Given the global nature of the drugs trade, international law enforcement co-operation remains a key element in the overall response. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N) based in Lisbon.</p><p>In this regard, I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in harnessing an international coalition of support to tackle the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is also having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The success is evident by the nationwide results of Operation Tara, which has a focus to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle drug related harms.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, including drug rehabilitation programmes, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. While implementation of the strategy is led by the Department of Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. In addition, we will continue to roll out the Greentown initiative which is designed to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.  <b></b></p><p>I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.</p></reply>

Through the implementation of the strategy, we will double the number of refuge spaces over the lifetime of this plan, while we put in place the required structures to deliver the higher Istanbul target after that. Doubling the number of refuge spaces will allow Ireland to meet the minimum standard obligation set out in the Istanbul convention. In parallel we will look at the mechanisms necessary to enable victims to stay safely in their own homes. </p>  <p>  Through the implementation of the Second National Strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, Ireland was able to meet the requirements to ratify the Istanbul Convention which was a priority for Government.  The actions delivered under the second national DSGBV strategy enabled this to be done in March 2019.</p>  <p>  Guidance provided by the Council of Europe sets minimum and aspirational standards for the provision of shelter places.</p>  <p>  As we are starting from a low base, the ambition is to meet the minimum standard obligation in the Strategy&rsquo;s lifetime which would be the fastest expansion of refuges in the history of the State.  I have also committed to going beyond this and reaching the higher standard outlined in the Istanbul guidance, in parallel with looking at mechanisms to enable victims to stay safely in their own homes. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Tusla completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identifies priority locations where there is a particular urgency and found that a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority.</p>  <p>  Therefore, as a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places over the next 5 years, i.e., 280 refuge spaces, which is one element of the requirement.  I regard the delivery of additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this so this is also a priority.</p>  <p>  Further analysis, as well as the work of an Interdepartmental group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively and in every county across the country. It commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently being developed in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations to be delivered by the end of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Through the development of a new Domestic Violence agency, as well as new structures and processes, we will be able to scale up the number of refuge spaces which we can deliver each year.</p>  <p>  This means that we will be delivering a much higher number of new refuge spaces towards the end of the strategy, than at the beginning of the strategy, with the aim of reaching the minimum standard  by 2026, and I expect this higher rate of delivery would continue beyond this strategy until we have reached our Istanbul targets.</p>  <p>  We have to recognise that, despite the best efforts of many dedicated people, historically there has been underprovision in this area resulting in a significant deficit in the availability of safe spaces in Ireland so existing provision is low.  I believe, however, that the targets set out in the Strategy are ambitious but achievable and that the changes we will make to the system for the delivery of refuge spaces which will ensure that women and men who seek safety will have refuge available to them.  </p></reply>

An unprecedented allocation of over &euro;2 billion is provided in Budget 2022 and we will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recruiting Garda members and Garda staff over the coming years, including through the current recruitment process which is identifying candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there was strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member, which is more than double the number of applications from the last competition in 2019. I want to commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the significant efforts that are being made to encourage diversity among members, which is reflective of modern society in Ireland, with notable increases in numbers applying from minority backgrounds including Travellers, Black Irish and Asian Irish.</p>  <p>  At the 31 May 2022 there were 14,347 Garda members. These Garda members are supported by 3,124 Garda staff. This represents respective increases of almost 11% and 56% since 2016 when there were 12,943 Garda members and 1,999 Garda staff nationwide. </p>  <p>  In addition to plans for continued recruitment and the expansion of the organisation, one of the key objectives in Justice Plan 2022 is the development of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a leading edge and accountable policing service through the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future (APSFF).  A range of measures are being taken to improve the delivery of policing, to bring more Garda&iacute; to the frontline, and to provide a greater focus on community policing based on local needs.  In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that, as of 31 May 2022, a total of 872 members have returned to frontline duties. </p></reply>

Two subgroups have been established under the forum to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are a range of fora in place in the Cork division for anti-social behaviour to be identified and responded to.</p>  <p>  For instance, under the Community Policing Framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in regular contact with community representatives, councillors, residents associations and members of the public. This allows for the gathering and sharing of information around issues of anti-social behaviour. In turn, Community Policing Units target these areas in an effort to alleviate the problem. The Garda Analysis Service also assist in identifying areas of concern.</p>  <p>  Members of the public can also highlight anti-social behaviour through Community Safety Forums which are held at least three times a year throughout Cork city. I am informed that any location highlighted as a concern for anti-social behaviour is noted at such meetings and added to a tasking sheet within the relevant Community Engagement Area and station for the implementation of increased patrols.</p>  <p>  Liaison with external stakeholders is conducted on an on-going basis by Garda Community Engagement teams, including with Cork City Partnership, Hollyhill Youth Project, Cork City Council, as well as local sporting clubs. Community Policing members also liaise with Muintir Na T&iacute;re and this is designed around safety for the elderly, particularly those living in areas where anti-social behaviour is reported.</p>  <p>  The Joint Policing Committee is an additional forum where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with external agencies to identify problem hotspots across the city. This will ultimately be expanded into a Local Community Safety Partnership when the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Department's community safety policy is published on the Gov.ie website and will be delivered through new Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), currently being piloted in three locations: Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots will run for two years and a robust evaluation is ongoing during this process in order to ensure the proposed structures are fulfilling their objectives.  This process will inform the national rollout of the LCSPs across local authority areas.</p>  <p>  The development of the Community Safety Innovation Fund is a key commitment under Justice Plan 2022 which will have a significant impact on the development of community safety projects throughout the country.  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department opened applications on 11 April for the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, which will see the proceeds of crime re-invested in local projects to improve community safety. The fund will have an initial outlay of &euro;2m for this year and will be subject to a robust evaluation at the end of Year 1 to inform future decisions. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the kind of projects which may be supported will include new activities, not  already covered by existing funding streams, including projects to:</p>  <p>  - tackle crime or reduce the fear of crime;</p>  <p>  - support the creation of safe and resilient communities; and</p>  <p>  - divert vulnerable individuals away from engagement in criminal behaviour.</p>  <p>  The fund is open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for in other funds managed by Departments and agencies. The call for applications for the fund ran until 8 June 2022 and grants will range from &euro;20,000 to &euro;150,000. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department has received 120 applications from a diverse range of organisations seeking to access funding for innovative projects to improve community safety. The process of initial eligibility assessment and scoring of the applications   is ongoing and will continue through the summer. I expect that grants will be made to the successful applicants in the autumn.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 also provides a comprehensive developmental framework to support children and young people subject to multiple disadvantage and guide them away from involvement in anti-social or criminal behaviours. </p>  <p>  Critically, the strategy commits to broadening the Youth Diversion Project (YDP) service so that every child or young person who could benefit from this service may do so, primarily through the expansion of the geographical coverage of the existing network of 105 Youth Diversion Projects, but also through the establishment of a small number of new projects where a need is identified. The YDP service will continue to play a vital role in combatting anti-social behaviour and supporting communities.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides an additional &euro;6.7 million in funding for Youth Justice services and Minister Browne announced on 22 June that over 50 YDPs will benefit from this additional funding. This funding goes a long way to making full YDP coverage in all parts of the country possible because it will allow for current YDPs to expand their boundaries. This includes over &euro;129,000 allocated for a boundary extension in the Watercourse Road, Greenmount area of Cork North Inner City.</p>  <p>  Finally, one of the two pilots of the Youth Joint Agency Response to Crime (Y-JARC) is currently taking place in Cork, operated out of the Mayfield and Gurranabraher Garda Districts. This pilot seeks relevant State agencies to engage with the young people identified as causing most harm in their locality in a joined-up manner, in order to provide the necessary support to assist them in ceasing their offending behaviour.</p></reply>

The process of initial eligibility assessment and scoring of the applications<s></s>is ongoing and will continue through the summer. I expect that grants will be made to the successful applicants in the autumn.</p><p>The fund is designed to ensure that the best and most innovative proposals to improve community safety will get the funding they need and will encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best. Additionally, it will allow best practice initiatives on community safety to be shared as new proposals get developed.</p><p>The fund reflects the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other agencies by using money seized from the proceeds of crime to support investment in community safety projects. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay of &euro;2m.  The new Community Safety Innovation Fund closed for applications for its first year of operation on June 8 2022.</p></reply>

Justice Plan 2022, which I published earlier this year, will continue the Department&rsquo;s focused commitment to working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local communities and wider society to eliminate such behaviour and support community safety into the future.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, Minister Browne has established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour to examine a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of such incidents on community morale and quality of life. Two subgroups have been established under the forum to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that there are a number of Garda operations in place in Dublin city centre and the wider DMR.  In October 2021, Operation Citizen commenced in the city centre and was initiated to reassure the citizens, visitors and the business community in Dublin city centre that it is a safe place in which to visit, socialise, conduct business and enjoy its amenities. The aim of this operation is to deliver an enhanced high visibility policing presence in the city centre on a daily basis.  This operation places a particular focus on anti-social behaviour, public order and quality of life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations.  </p>  <p>  In January this year, the Garda authorities launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen. The aim of Operation Saul is to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the DMR.  </p>  <p>  Operation Boardwalk is in place in the DMR North Central Division designed to specifically tackle anti-social behaviour in the environs of the Liffey Boardwalk, Bachelor's Walk and Eden Quay and consists of proactive engagement with groups of youths and people engaged in public consumption of alcohol.</p>  <p>  Operation Pier and Operation Spire are also underway within Dublin City Centre, in the DMR South Central and North Central Divisions respectively.  These form the basis of a regional response to city centre street-level drug dealing and possession of drugs, with members performing dedicated patrols in areas known to have a high concentration of such issues. Some key areas targeted are those that have a significant nighttime economy.</p>  <p>  Both operations are undertaken by uniformed and plain-clothes members on a full-time basis, with the objective of investigating, detecting, preventing and prosecuting criminal offences committed under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A large proportion of these operations focus on high-visibility and proactive policing and engagement with the residential and business communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Irene commenced in the DMR on 1 June, 2022 and continues until 31 August, 2022. Operation Irene aims to combat under-age alcohol consumption and the consumption of alcohol in public places in the DMR, in a targeted operation through the enforcement of legislation regulating the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol and other associated legislation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that Operation Limmat is the DMR&rsquo;s assault in public and public order reduction strategy.  Operation Limmat promotes a pro-arrest and early-investigation approach to incidents of assault, together with driving high-visibility policing in public places to act as a deterrent to prevent and reduce assaults and public order offences in the DMR.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a new property on O&rsquo;Connell Street has been identified as a strategically important location to enhance An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high-visibility policing service in the DMR North Central Division. When opened, this facility will support and enhance the existing policing service in Dublin city centre and will provide a range of Garda services to the public.  The premises will also act as a base for members on a number of key Garda Operations running in the city centre, notably Operation Citizen.</p></reply>

A key aspect of the reform is to assign more Garda&iacute; to frontline duties and to provide a greater focus on community policing based on local needs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the rollout of the Operating Model is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister for Justice, have no role in such matters.</p>  <p>  The new model, announced by the Garda Commissioner in August 2019, introduces major changes to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing more front-line Garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility, and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area.</p>  <p>  Reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a priority for me and the development of a leading edge and accountable policing service through the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future is one of the key goals in Justice Plan 2022.</p>  <p>  Under the Divisional Policing Model being introduced, all services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level, to allow greater specialisation and to release Garda&iacute; from back office functions, and Garda Districts will no longer form part of the organisational structure.</p>  <p>  This will result in a reduction in the number of Garda Divisions from the current 28 to 19 with each comprised of four Functional Areas: Community Engagement, Crime, Performance Assurance and Business Services.</p>  <p>  A significant change to the Mayo Division under the Operating Model is the amalgamation with the Roscommon/Longford Division. As an amalgamated Division, Mayo/Roscommon/Longford will have an increased number of Garda personnel across the region, enabling better management of workload and capacity, which will result in a standardisation of procedures and ways of working.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities inform me that the implementation of the Operating Model has initially focused on the Business Services Functional Area. The Mayo/Roscommon/Longford Division has established all elements of the Business Services Functional Area, led by an Assistant Principal. The Business Services Functional Area is reducing the amount of administrative activities performed by operational Members. In turn, this is releasing Garda members to focus on frontline and community policing.</p></reply>

This report will be a valuable contribution to the evidence base available to inform future policy development in this regard.</p>  <p>  While it is clear that there is more work to be done, significant work is underway across the justice sector to develop better relationships with the Traveller community.</p>  <p>  In particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to providing a human-rights focused policing service that protects the rights of all people they come into contact with. This is at the heart of the Garda Code of Ethics and the Garda Decision Making Model, and has been spoken about repeatedly by Commissioner Harris.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has put a strong focus on equality, diversity and inclusion, as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seek to embed the principle that human rights are the foundation and the purpose of policing in Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have demonstrated this in recent years through the establishment of the Garda National Diversity &amp;amp; Integration Unit (GNDIU), publication of an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy Statement and Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have made strides in developing good relationships with the Traveller Community and its representative bodies through initiatives such as the establishment of a Garda-Traveller Advisory Group, Garda-Traveller Dialogue Days, and Traveller representative groups assisting in providing training for Garda recruits and Garda members.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important that we ensure that police powers are exercised in a consistent and unbiased way and that marginalised individuals and groups are not disproportionately impacted. The An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill will address the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland&rsquo;s recommendation that - for the purposes of clarity and transparency - police powers of search, arrest and detention should be codified and supported by statutory codes of practice. This is supported by relevant training to ensure members have the personal and professional expertise to proactively police Ireland's diverse community. </p>  <p>  I would also point to the important role of the Judicial Council in ensuring a high level of public confidence in, and maintaining, the acknowledged high standards of excellence of, our judiciary. The Judicial Studies Committee has been established to deliver regular judicial training, including on judicial conduct and ethics, and on unconscious bias and vulnerable witnesses.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the report will be considered across the justice sector with a view to taking all possible steps to improve service delivery and outcomes to our Travelling Community.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the deployment of Garda members throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimal use.

The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 31 May 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 84 trainees currently in the college.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a strong tradition of community engagement and visible policing, and this funding demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources required to build on this high level of engagement and to ensure our communities are safe. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that, as of 31 May 2022 there were 14,347 Garda members nationwide. In addition, and as a result of the increasing levels of recruitment of Garda staff to the organisation, over 800 Garda members to date have also been reassigned to frontline policing duties in recent years, where their expertise and training can be best utilised to provide visible policing to our communities. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  It is vital that everyone in our society sees members of their own communities serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I particularly welcome that 40% of applicants were women and that there is a notable increase in numbers applying from minority backgrounds including Travellers, Black Irish and Asian Irish.  Successful candidates from this competition will begin entering the Garda college later this year, and the new panel will provide the capacity for continued recruitment into next year.</p>  <p>  Very significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the provision for a capital budget of &euro;147 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ICT and Building Programme and ongoing investment in the organisation&rsquo;s transport fleet. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high-visibility policing in our towns and cities. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the landscape of issues faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is changing. For example, the increase in fraud offences shows that policing does not only take place on the streets, it must also put a focus on cyber-related crimes.</p>  <p>  Finally, and of great benefit to the delivery of modern policing services in the community, the Garda Commissioner is in the course of introducing the new Garda Operating Model which, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, is designed to make changes to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide for more frontline Garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility, and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area. </p></reply>

It is a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes. Community-based CCTV is currently governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, the Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon wrote to me setting out her concerns with the administration of the community CCTV schemes in Ireland.  She noted that the arrangements had not been updated to take account of the GDPR and she suggested that she would use her extensive enforcement powers if there was no radical overhaul of the Community CCTV schemes.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of this letter, my officials met with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Data Protection Commission on a number of occasions.  Agreement was reached on a proposed new scheme which has been included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 which has been approved by Government on 21 June 2022 and which will be published in the coming weeks.  The new scheme is GDPR compliant. </p>  <p>  The new scheme only allows for local authorities or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be authorised to run community CCTV schemes in the future. Authorisations will last for up to five years.  Data protection impact assessments and joint data controller agreements will have to be provided.  </p>  <p>  Applications for schemes will have to be precise about the number of cameras, the exact location and the extent of their coverage. Specific details about the confidentiality of data, security, storage, retention, erasure and destruction of data will be set out in a Code of Practice to be drafted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to be submitted to the Minister for Justice for inclusion in a Statutory Instrument. It shall be an offence to operate CCTV or to cause CCTV to be operated without the appropriate authorisation or to falsify ,conceal destroy or otherwise dispose of information gathered by CCTV under this legislation.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious that I wish to retain community sector involvement in the new scheme even though, they will no longer be able to operate schemes or receive an authorisation. It is my intention that when the Community Safety Partnerships are established under the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill,  this will be the forum where community groups can make the case for having a CCTV scheme in their community.  The scheme must get the approval of both the local authority and the Garda Commissioner but it is my intention to retain that important community link. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.150.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500059#WRB05400"><p>It is my intention that every person who needs a refuge space will have access to one.  I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  </p>  <p>  Last week, I brought to Government the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency. Among Tusla's considerations were population and distance from refuges.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.</p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.</p>  <p>  Athlone, which services a significant catchment area within Co Roscommon, and Sligo are identified in the review as priority locations for the development of refuge services. It is expected that developments in Sligo and the wider midlands area would also improve access for those in Co. Roscommon and Co. Galway.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  The strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

These include measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development.</p><p>  The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to provide additional resources and services in certain areas.</p><p>  In July of last year, Minister Humphreys obtained Government approval for an Implementation Plan for the report. The Government also committed to a special focus on Drogheda, including Departments and State agencies prioritising necessary funding applications for projects related to the Drogheda Implementation Plan.</p><p>  The Implementation Plan identifies the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outlines the next steps for engagement and delivery. The Plan is a living document and will be reviewed by my Department each quarter, with progress reports produced twice yearly. This approach will facilitate ongoing engagement and consultation and my Department has just completed the first quarterly review. The first progress report of the Drogheda Implementation Plan, combining updates from Q1 and Q2 of 2022, is currently under development and will be published in Quarter 3 of this year.</p><p>The most important aspect of the Plan is at local level where the Drogheda Implementation Board is the core driver and co-ordinator of the activities outlined in the plan and my Department leads national oversight to ensure strategic direction, action planning and the delivery of the Drogheda Implementation Plan. </p><p>The first meetings of the Drogheda Implementation Board took place on 13 October 2021 and a number of positive actions have arisen from the plan to date. For example:</p><p>- The Department of Education has provided additional supports to the three Northside schools identified in the report for a five year period.</p><p>- My own Department and the HSE have provided further funding to the Red Door Project to ensure the continued provision of their important services. In total across 2021 and 2022, this represents an investment of &euro;230,000 in staffing resources to provide additional services in the Drogheda area.</p><p>- Funding was also provided to the Moneymore Consortium to support their planning work for the proposed development of a community hub facility and to the Moneymore Childcare Centre to ensure the continuation of the essential meal service they provide to children.</p><p>- My Department has also secured a further &euro;250,000 in Dormant Accounts Funding for continued implementation of targeted crime prevention and harm-reduction measures in Drogheda in 2022.</p><p>- My Department also announced additional Youth Diversion Funding of almost &euro;75,000 for early intervention and family supports to the Boyne Project.</p><p>Further details on the progress to date will be available in the upcoming progress report.</p></reply>

I wish to thank the Deputy for his significant work on the Strategy during his tenure as Minister of State.</p><p>The Strategy includes consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p><p>The Strategy document, as published on my Department's website, includes a comprehensive implementation statement, laying out the key objectives and actions of the plan, and the lead agency for each deliverable. </p><p>The Strategy commits to the publication of an annual implementation update from the Governance and Strategy Group (GSG) provided for in the implementation statement, the first of which is due to be published shortly.</p><p>However, I can share the following update of actions that are already in progress:</p><p>- Since the launch of the strategy in April 2021, we have established dedicated inter-agency oversight and co-ordination groups at national level, led by my Department. </p><p>- We have established a stakeholder advisory group, chaired by Minister Browne, to ensure that we maintain a strong working relationship with the community sector as we go about implementing the strategy.</p><p>- We have established an enhanced research partnership, known as REPPP, with the University of Limerick which is providing dedicated research and evidential support for policy development as well as supporting effective practices in front-line Youth Justice services.</p><p>- REPPP is also supporting cutting edge pilot initiatives such as the Greentown programme to engage with children involved in criminal networks, and the expansion of the Bail Supervision Scheme.</p><p>We have made important progress with an ambitious expansion programme for the network of Youth Diversion Projects, and enhancing the scope of the services which they provide. Budget 2022 provides an additional &euro;6.7 million in funding for Youth Justice services, which meets a key commitment of the Strategy to expand the Youth Diversion Project (YDP) network so that every child/young person who could benefit from these services is able to do so. There are currently 105 YDPs across the State, acting as a vital community based support to the statutory Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</p><p>Minister Browne announced on 22 June that over 50 YDPs will benefit from this additional funding to:</p><p>- Extend the boundaries of some YDPs to increase coverage, as provided for in the Youth Justice Strategy,</p><p>- Increase funding to engage with the harder to reach cohort of referrals,</p><p>- Provide additional early intervention supports,</p><p>- Provide family supports to the relatives of those young people engaged with the YDPs,</p><p>- Further develop the Solas initiative in Dublin.</p><p>Of this &euro;6.7million, approximately &euro;780,000 has also been set aside to establish a limited number of additional YDPs this year in geographical areas not currently covered by YDPs to ensure that the service is available to every child or young person in the State who would benefit from it.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service (GSAS) closely monitors crime trends and disseminates analysis on a regional and divisional basis. This feeds directly into planning operational activities aimed at reducing and preventing crime.</p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that local Garda management continue to monitor crime trends across their respective Divisions. I understand that when specific crime trends/patterns are identified, local management consider additional measures outside of normal policing responses, including location-specific patrols, intelligence-led operations, and searches and arrests to combat known individuals involved in such crimes.  As the Deputy will appreciate, these measures are best implemented on a local basis and this is an operational decision for the Garda&iacute;.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are a number of Garda operations in place in Dublin city centre and the wider DMR. </p>  <p>  In October 2021, Operation Citizen commenced in the city centre and was initiated to reassure the citizens, visitors and the business community in Dublin city centre that it is a safe place. The aim of this operation is to deliver an enhanced high visibility policing presence in the city centre on a daily basis.  This operation places a particular focus on anti-social behaviour, public order and quality of life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations.  </p>  <p>  In January this year, the Garda authorities launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen. The aim of Operation Saul is to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR).  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, Operation Irene commenced in the DMR on 1 June, 2022 and continues until 31 August, 2022. The aim of this operation is to combat under-age alcohol consumption and the consumption of alcohol in public places in the DMR, in a targeted operation through the enforcement of legislation regulating the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol and other associated legislation.</p>  <p>  Operation Limmat is the DMR&rsquo;s Assault in public and public order reduction strategy.  The Operation promotes a pro-arrest and early-investigation approach to incidents of assault together with driving high-visibility policing in public places to act as a deterrent to prevent and reduce assaults and public order offences in the DMR.</p></reply>

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy, '<i>Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025'</i>. This strategy represents a whole-of-government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland.</p><p>Drug-related intimidation is a very serious issue and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) previously worked with the National Family Support Network to develop <i>&lsquo;the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&rsquo;</i>to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug-related intimidation, which met the obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under action 4.1.42 of the national drugs and alcohol strategy. </p><p>I am informed by Garda authorities that the Commissioner tasked an Inspector in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation. There are currently thirty nominated Garda Inspectors appointed to act as liaison officers for the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, covering each Garda Division.</p><p>Additionally, the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme annual conferences, which are coordinated via the National Drug Strategy Project Office at the GNDOCB, play a very important role in creating awareness of the programme among Garda members and the general public via the nominated Inspectors and Local / Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Force representatives in attendance. The next conference is scheduled to take place during August 2022.</p><p>People seeking assistance may contact their local Inspector confidentially who will provide practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation. Information in relation to the <i>Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme</i>and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide is available on the Garda Website, www.garda.ie. Furthermore, people may seek assistance or report a crime by contacting the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666111 or Crimestoppers on 1800 250025.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, in November 2021, Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Well Being and the National Drugs Strategy, Frank Feighan TD, launched <i>A Data Driven Intervention Model to Respond Effectively to Drug Related Intimidation and Violence in Communities in Ireland</i>, which is a report and model developed under the Drug Related Intimidation &amp;amp; Violence (DRIVE) project. The DRIVE Project is a multi-agency national initiative to build the capacity of communities to respond more effectively to drug related intimidation and violence with an outline of systems and structures that could be replicated in any community.</p></reply>

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. As a result, Garda numbers are now at over 14,300 Garda members and over 3,100 Garda staff nationwide. The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>   As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As Minister, I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimal use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 31 May 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 14,347 Garda members across the country. At the end of 2020, that number was 14,491.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also had an exceptional impact across the country over the past two years.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, detailed statistics on Garda workforce numbers are published on my Department's website and updated on a monthly basis.</p></reply>

A key pillar of the Programme for Government is building stronger and safer communities. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department funds a number of initiatives around the country to help build rural safety. In coordination with our colleagues in the National Rural Safety Forum, Minister Browne intends to develop and publish a Rural Safety Action Plan this autumn, which will complement the work of the Forum and consolidate the many excellent initiatives which are already underway on rural safety nationally. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and detecting crime. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The 2021-2022 winter phase of Operation Thor was launched by Garda&iacute; in October 2021. Operation Thor is designed to tackle burglaries and associated criminal activities, which often increase in the darker winter months, through targeted enforcement and crime prevention activity and information.</p>  <p>  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property-related crime since its inception in November 2015. In 2015, there were in excess of 18,800 residential burglaries reported. By contrast, in 2021 there were just over 6,000 residential burglaries reported, a reduction of over 66% or approximately 13,000 fewer residential burglaries.</p>  <p>  While the COVID-19 pandemic was clearly a factor in some of this reduction, with people more likely to be present in their homes throughout the day, there has been a marked and consistent downward trend in such offences since the introduction of this Garda focus through Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2022 of over &euro;2 billion. The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 11,000 people applying to become a member. The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.</p>  <p>  My Department has for many years provided funding for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert Programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. In 2021, my Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by the Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill will also provide for the establishment of innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees, and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. Three pilot partnerships are currently underway in Longford, Waterford and Dublin's North Inner City.</p></reply>

In line with these commitments, a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact on immigration processing times, including the introduction of online applications, a new customer service helpdesk and a new customer-focused immigration website. </p>  <p>  As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the additional staff assigned to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were delivered, which is the highest number of decisions since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. </p>  <p>  For the first six months of 2022, almost 7,900 citizenship decisions have been issued, including 980 decisions on minor applications. This exceeds the total number of minor decisions issued during the whole of last year (868 minor decisions).</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is also freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. </p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  </p>  <p>  Last week, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised</p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.</p>  <p>  The initial areas identified in the Tusla review include Balbriggan where ten family places are suggested as a starting point for prioritisation.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  The strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

FLAC plays a key role in the provision of legal information, advice and advocacy work and regularly engages with my Department on access to justice matters.  </p><p>  My Department also provides substantial annual funding to FLAC to ensure that it can continue its important work helping people with legal problems. In Budget 2021 I trebled the funding for FLAC's telephone information referral line and I maintained that level of funding for this year. Their Annual Report notes that last year the highest number of calls were made to the referral line since 2015, with over 13,000 calls. </p><p>  The Annual Report also highlights an unmet legal need particularly in the areas of family and employment law. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a review of the civil legal aid scheme, which FLAC has called a very significant moment in the history of access to justice.</p><p>  FLAC is an important member of the Review Group and its insights from working to promote equal access to justice for all will be invaluable to the Group as its work progresses.</p><p>The review will allow for an assessment of how well access to justice is facilitated by our Civil Legal Aid Scheme, particularly for those on low incomes. The Review Group will make recommendations for its future, including in relation to eligibility.</p><p>  The Review Group is chaired by the former Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, and follows on from the work he has previously led under the Chief Justice's Access to Justice Working Group. The Review Group has commenced its work, which is expected to take a period of 12 months. It will report periodically on the progress of its work, before submitting its final report to me once its work is completed.</p><p>  The Review of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme is part of a broader civil justice reform programme that I am spearheading across my Justice Plan 2022.</p><p>  FLAC&rsquo;s Annual Report highlighted that in 2021 almost a third of all queries to its Telephone Information and Referral Line related to family law matters. I am determined to overhaul the operation of the Family Justice System, to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts the family at the centre of its work. Work on drafting the Family Court Bill is progressing with a view to publishing the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.</p></reply>

These locations allow the proposed structure to be trialed in a high population density area, a medium population density area and a low population density area, with a regional distribution. The pilots are subject to independent evaluation, with learning outcomes taken into account in the drafting of the statutory framework for community safety and applied to the national roll out of similar partnerships in communities across the country.</p><p>  Membership of these Local Community Safety Partnerships includes representatives from relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and councillors as well as residents and community groups, representatives of youth, new communities and the voluntary, business and education sectors.</p><p>  The pilots are each chaired by an independent chairperson and each pilot is also supported by a dedicated staff member - the local community safety coordinator - whose role is to support the Partnership, engage the residents in the community on safety issues and link them in with the work of the Partnership.</p><p>  The three pilot LCSPs have received funding for the provision of administrative support to undertake their work by my Department through the Dormant Accounts Fund. In addition, in recognition of the scale and complexity of the work of the North Inner City Dublin Partnership, additional funding was made available from the North East Inner City (NEIC) initiative and from my Department.</p><p>  Each Local Community Safety Partnership will develop a Local Community Safety Plan which will identify actions and the Department or Agency with responsibility for fulfilling these actions. Support to implement these actions will come from existing budget allocations. </p><p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships may also apply for funding for additional community safety interventions through the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, the establishment of which is provided for in Budget 2022. It is intended that this fund will support investment in projects which propose an innovative approach to improve community safety and which aren&rsquo;t already covered under the costing funding streams. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, has an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m. The call for applications for 2022 closed on 8 June. The process of initial eligibility assessment and scoring of the applications is ongoing and will continue through the summer. I expect that grants will be made to the successful applicants in the autumn.</p><p>  Under the criteria of the fund, the applications for capital funding costs will only be considered if they are integral to a proposal itself and appropriately apportioned. Applications for capital costs alone are not eligible. The maintenance and expansion of an existing community CCTV scheme would therefore not be eligible. However, the Department also administers a Community Based CCTV Grand Aid Scheme. The scheme is intended to support local communities wishing to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and deterring illegal or anti-social behaviour. </p><p>  Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Community_based_CCTV_grant_aid_scheme_Information_and_Documentation</p></reply>

The Inspectorate also has responsibility for investigating deaths of prisoners in the custody of the Irish Prison Service. </p><p>The Office of the Inspector of Prisons has developed 'An Inspection Framework for the Inspection of Prisons in Ireland' which was launched on 15 September 2020. It sets out how the Inspectorate will conduct inspections of prisons in Ireland and is informed by the statutory underpinning of the Inspector in legislation, national legislation relating to prisons and prisoners&rsquo; rights, and international obligations owing to prisoners. Under this Framework, the Inspector will engage with and survey both prisoners and prison staff to gather information on prison conditions and prisoner welfare. </p><p>Following this, the Inspector embarked on an inspection of all prisons in Ireland in 2021. These inspections, while short in duration due to the situation with COVID-19, examined the treatment of prisoners and conditions in prisons across the Framework focus areas which are - </p><p>- Safety and Security;</p><p>- Respect and Dignity;</p><p>- Health and Wellbeing;</p><p>- Rehabilitation and Development;</p><p>- Resettlement.</p><p>The Inspectorate also developed a COVID-19 staff survey to assess the experience of prison staff working in prisons in 2021, and engaged in ongoing discussion with prison management and the Prison Service to provide robust inspections of all prisons in Ireland. These inspections resulted in twelve inspection reports which, when taken together, provide a general inspection account of the prison estate during the COVID-19 pandemic. These inspection reports, and the COVID-19 Staff Survey report, have all been published and can be found on the websites of the Inspector of Prisons and my Department. </p><p>I am advised that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons will conduct two general inspections of Irish Prisons in 2022 and one thematic inspection of a high-risk area.  The Office of the Inspector of Prisons will also conduct a  Strategic Threat and Risk Assessment Process in Q4 2022. This process will determine the inspection programme for 2023.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  </p>  <p>  Last week, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority.  Further analysis and the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.</p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.</p>  <p>  The initial areas identified in the Tusla review include Cavan/Monaghan, where eight family places are suggested as a starting point for prioritisation.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  The Strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the Strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

If an individual fails to comply with any bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant and this gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.</p>  <p>  In the event of a breach of High Court bail, the defendant must be brought before the Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge and an order and/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.</p>  <p>  While I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the State's amended bail laws have proven to be effective, all legislative provisions are kept under review, in light of the existing provisions and safeguards relating to the granting of bail.</p>  <p>  Zero Tolerance, the Third National Strategy on Domestic Sexual and Gender Based Violence commits to establish a review cycle to identify outstanding and emerging further reforms required to law, practice and procedure outside of supporting the victim/survivor (with attention to the voices of adult and child survivors). As part of this work, consideration will be given to the possibility of placing limitations on the availability of bail for breaches of barring orders where there is a history of violence. </p></reply>

The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine roles that are either in critical short supply or are ineligible for an employment permit where it is evidenced that there is sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular, evidence-based review guided by relevant research, a public/stakeholder consultation, the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. Account is also taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors, such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  The construction sector was the subject of reviews of the last couple of years, with a significant number of occupations added to the Critical Skills Occupations List early in 2019 and then again later that year. </p>  <p>  The submission from the sector to the most recent review, supported by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, requested a number of roles remaining on the Ineligible Occupations List be removed and become eligible for employment permits. In recognition of the challenges faced by the sector and strong evidence of continued labour shortages, that request was granted in full, the result being that almost all roles in the construction sector are now eligible for employment permits.</p>  <p>  Changes to the employment permit occupations lists are made where there are no suitable Irish/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, genuine skills shortage exists rather than a recruitment or retention problem and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to review the employment permits system in light of changing labour market circumstances and the construction sector will be considered in the context of the next review of the occupations lists to be undertaken by the end of the year.  When the next review commences, submissions will be invited from sector representative bodies and interested parties via the Public Consultation Form which will be accessible on the Department&rsquo;s website throughout the consultation period.</p></reply>

The credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) has been applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June, and includes prepay meters. The scheme is operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) and electricity suppliers with oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p>  <p>  This is an exceptional measure which uses the single eligibility criterion of an electricity meter point registration number (MPRN), to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible this year, without any additional means testing. The payment has been applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2), as set out in section 1 of the Act.</p>  <p>  As of 27 May 2022, 2,129,832 domestic electricity customers had been credited, with 1,845,142 of these customers having been notified via a line item on their bill or prepayment vend receipt. This means that 99% of all eligible customers had the credit applied to their account. </p>  <p>  In cases where households are in rental accommodation and do not have an individual MPRN, where tenants have disputes relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.</p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: Clean Export Tariff - Commission for Regulation of Utilities (cru.ie).</p>  <p>  Micro-generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (esbnetworks.ie)). Over 32,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 22,000 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for their exported electricity, and payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022, whichever is the latest. </p>  <p>  The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,620.</p><p>Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total. Furthermore, access to properties during restricted periods, in line with Government guidelines, was often challenging. </p><p>There are currently over 9,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.  It is important to note that the SEAI received 4,077 applications for the scheme  to the end of May this year, compared with 2,874 for the whole of 2021.  The increased publicity around the launch of the new SEAI National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme and revisions to the Warmer Homes Scheme, together with increased energy costs are driving demand.</p><p>Reducing the waiting times on the Warmer Homes scheme waiting list is a top priority for my Department and SEAI and in order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken: </p><p>- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund; </p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme; </p><p>- SEAI is working to Increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of applicants by county is not routinely reported by SEAI.  However, the number of applicants nationally in the past five years is set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Warmer Homes Scheme</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Applications Received</td>       <td>7,408</td>       <td>5,682</td>       <td>2,858</td>       <td>2,874</td>       <td>4,077</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of approvals (i.e. homes completed) by county in the past five years is set out in the Table below.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Homes Completed</b></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2022*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>173</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>147</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>504</td>       <td>223</td>       <td>142</td>       <td>153</td>       <td>115</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>587</td>       <td>162</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>116</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>829</td>       <td>649</td>       <td>500</td>       <td>693</td>       <td>535</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>242</td>       <td>172</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>329</td>       <td>84</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>167</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>41</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>121</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>139</td>       <td>115</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>214</td>       <td>195</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>124</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>116</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>105</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>144</td>       <td>84</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>117</td>       <td>179</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>84</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>140</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>317</td>       <td>178</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>113</td>       <td>118</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>5,218</td>       <td>3,138</td>       <td>1,520</td>       <td>2,124</td>       <td>1,453</td>    </tr> </table> *to end of May 2022</p><p>Data in relation to average wait time by County is not routinely collected by SEAI presently but will be monitored going forward.  SEAI reports to my Department on the average cycle times from application to completion which is set out in the Table below.

This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance.  </p><p>As part of these new supports, new increased grant rates are available under the Better Energy Homes scheme and Community Energy Grant scheme, thereby allowing homeowners to choose the best home upgrade option to suit their particular needs. The Better Energy Homes Scheme allows homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage the project. The Community Energy Grant Scheme is also available for homeowners wishing to undertake their energy upgrades as part of a community project.</p><p>The SEAI advise that eight One Stop Shops have now been registered and SEAI is actively working with applicant organisations to support them through this registration process. One-Stop-Shops will be distributed across Ireland, with an increased number offering services nationwide through their network of contractors throughout the country, including counties Laois and Offaly. Other One-Stop-Shops will work within geographic regions. </p><p>The SEAI advise that under the Community Energy Grant Scheme, the Project Co-ordinators work nationally and across multiple counties expanding their overall reach. There are currently 752 contractors serving the Leinster area under the Better Energy Home Scheme; 32 contractors are located in Laois and 29 in Offaly. </p><p>Data provided by the SEAI on the number of homes upgraded to a post works BER B2 or better under each scheme in Counties Laois and Offaly can be found detailed in the below table. Homes for 2022 under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme and Community Energy Grant Scheme are not expected to be completed until later this year.

It is sponsored by my Department and regulated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), with Bord Na M&oacute;na acting as the operators of the scheme. The EDRRS provides for the enhanced rehabilitation of 33,000 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands that had been previously harvested for peat extraction for electricity generation over a 5-year period.</p>  <p>  All of the lands being rehabilitated are operated under Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licences granted by the Environmental Protection Agency, and the EDRRS is building on, and complementing, the measures required under IPC licences. This rehabilitation will improve ecological and hydrological conditions in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, where conditions are suitable, reinstate carbon sequestration conditions over time.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) is investing up to &euro;108 million in the EDRRS. This funding supports a just transition by maintaining jobs in the Midlands, as well as laying the foundation for more substantial and sustainable job creation into the future. Permanent and seasonal employees who had been involved in peat production to date across counties Galway, Meath, Kildare, Westmeath, Offaly, Roscommon, Laois and Longford, have been provided an opportunity for employment by Bord na M&oacute;na on rehabilitation and greenway activities, including EDRRS, or other Bord na M&oacute;na activities. The peak number employed on EDRRS to date is 225. </p></reply>

A newly established Seafood / Offshore Renewable Energy Working Group, to which an independent Chair was recently appointed by the Minister for Housing, will provide an important forum to facilitate communication, understanding and constructive engagement between these important sectors. Ireland has a target to achieve 5GW of offshore renewable energy by 2030 to deliver on our climate objectives and increase our energy security. This will be primarily met off our eastern and southern coasts reflecting the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of fixed bottom wind turbines, the availability of electricity grid infrastructure capacity and proximity to the largest demand centres.</p><p>  Two batches of offshore renewable energy projects will be required to progress through the new consenting system to achieve these targets. Applications for Maritime Area Consents from a defined set of pre-qualified Phase 1 projects are currently being assessed by my Department. This assessment involves considering the technical and financial capability of prospective developers to ensure only the most viable projects can enter the planning system. If granted a MAC, developers are then eligible to apply for development permission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. All applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will involve a robust assessment of project specific details, include environmental assessment and full public consultation.</p><p>  My Department recently held a consultation on the criteria to use to select the second batch of projects required to meet our 5GW target. Responses are currently being assessed, with a decision on the Phase Two criteria to be taken later this year.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC). The Young Adult Card was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. We are currently working on broadening the initiative to include commercial bus services, with the aim to have that in place before the return of third level colleges. This will mean that nationwide, those aged between 19 and 23 will be able to avail of an average 50% discount in their public transport fares.  </p>  <p>  The initiative is aimed at supporting our young people to establish strong sustainable mobility habits; setting public transport fares at appropriate levels is key to achieving this objective. I am pleased to say, since April when a further 20% reduction in PSO fares was introduced, all passengers under the age of 24 in possession of a LEAP card now travel on PSO services at significantly reduced rates. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. As such, I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. </p>  <p>  In addition, as well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.</p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question in relation to the estimated full-year cost of extending the youth travel card and associated 50% discount in public transport fares to all young persons aged 24 and 25 years, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Dispatch operators are required to only provide bookings to SPSV licensed drivers using SPSV licensed vehicles.  </p>  <p>  A fundamental tenet of Ireland&rsquo;s SPSV regulatory regime is that only SPSV licensed drivers and vehicles are used for the carriage of passengers for reward, to protect the consumer and help ensure public safety.  The approach taken in Ireland in this area has been since adopted in other jurisdictions.  While there is a common misconception that the old-style Uber &ldquo;random standard driving licence holder&rdquo; still operates in the UK and throughout Europe, the Deputy should be aware that, after experiences of ride-hailing as recently described in the media, regulations have been changed in the UK to only permit police vetted and licensed drivers to operate &ndash; even for &ldquo;rideshare&rdquo; - in London.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm that I met with Uber representatives on 10th June last.  Uber is satisfied with the regulatory structure of the SPSV industry in Ireland, as it&rsquo;s clear to the company how it can legally operate here.   </p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, earlier this year, these supports for the commercial sector were further extended up to the 30th of June 2022. To date over &euro;65m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. The Government decision did not include broadening this initiative to include commercial bus operators.</p>  <p>  I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC). The Young Adult Card was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May. It is envisaged that the YAC will be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.  The NTA is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.  To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the fair reduction scheme and commercial bus companies, particularly in rural communities  to, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The car must be purchased before applying for VRT and VAT relief, as applicable to the category of adaptations made to the vehicle.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons who meet one of six medical criteria, as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.

We  both agree that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  We believe that this is the most appropriate forum to meet our mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. A stock-taking exercise of existing transport and mobility schemes currently supporting people with disabilities is ongoing ahead of the next meeting of the group. The issue was also discussed at the most recent meeting of the NDIS Steering Group on April 13th, which included input from stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any potential changes to the scheme in advance of these proposals.</p></reply>

Our VAT thresholds were increased to their current values, &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, on 1 May 2008.  Under VAT law, traders/businesses such as B&amp;B&rsquo;s are required to register and account for VAT where their supply of guest or holiday accommodation exceeds the services threshold. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s current registration thresholds are some of the most generous thresholds in the EU. Some Member States do not operate any VAT registration threshold, requiring all businesses to register. As an administrative practice, Revenue allow businesses that are approaching the threshold to take account of the VAT element of their Purchases-for-Resale in calculating turnover. This avoids a &lsquo;cliff-face&rsquo; effect when approaching the threshold. There is no data available to suggest a bunching effect below the threshold.</p>  <p>  In setting registration thresholds levels, the objective is to strike an appropriate balance between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the Revenue authorities and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions relative to registered firms. However every business keeps records and the vast majority of businesses keep these records electronically. Therefore, there is not that much additional administration involved in being registered for VAT beyond submitting VAT returns and, for some small businesses, this might only entail an annual VAT return.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  In considering the case for such a tax, it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.</p>  <p>  The LPT returns included questions such as whether a property is vacant, the reasons for the vacancy and if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. It should be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system. Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. </p>  <p>  According to the preliminary Census figures release two weeks ago, 166,752 vacant dwellings were recorded in Census 2022. This is a decrease of 9% compared to 2016 (-16,560, down from 183,312). It is an even further reduction (12%) compared to 2011, when 230,056 vacant dwellings were recorded &ndash; giving a rate of 7.8%. it should be noted that this is a point in time measure of vacancy relating to the weeks either side of Census Night and is not intended to be a measure of long term vacancy or that these properties are available for re-use. These homes may well have been occupied again a few weeks after Census Night.</p>  <p>  I note the total number of vacant properties notified by property owners to Revenue is not directly equivalent to the total number of vacant dwellings counted by Census enumerators on Census Night. This is primarily due to the difference in data collection methodology. However, both sets of data are important in considering the case for a tax on vacant residential property.</p>  <p>  I will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns shortly. </p>  <p>  Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government, as evidenced in the Housing for All strategy where one of the four pathways in the plan is specifically dedicated to this area.</p></reply>

These units are under the control of a NAMA appointed receiver, John McStay of McStay Luby. </p>  <p>  NAMA understands from the appointed receiver, Mr McStay, that it is not the case that the apartments cannot be insured until fire works are completed.  The receiver has advised NAMA of his understanding of the current position regarding block insurance. The current insurer (QBE) is exiting this aspect of the Irish market, thereby necessitating a change of insurer.  Subject to a fully completed proposal, which must include the claims history and a plan to remedy any known defects to the common areas, it is understood that cover can be made available. The insurance broker for the receiver has offered to assist the OMC (Owners Management Company) with the matter but to date has not received a response from the managing agent for the OMC of Carrickmines Green.</p>  <p>  NAMA has been advised by the receiver that he has been engaging extensively with the OMC, and its appointed legal and insurance advisors, in relation to the insurance and any queries raised. In addition, the receiver, in his capacity as agent of the developer and without any legal obligation or requirement to do so (as recently determined by the Court of Appeal in separate proceedings, entitled  Grehan &amp;amp; Ors v Maynooth Business Campus Owners&rsquo; Management CLG [High Court record number 2018/5042P] has carried out very substantial remediation works to the development which were funded by NAMA.  It is therefore simply incorrect to suggest that NAMA or the appointed receiver has, in some way, dealt improperly or unfairly with the private owners or residents of this development. In fact, the contrary is true.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am advised that there is extant litigation between the receiver and the OMC in relation to the development at Carrickmines Green. The OMC sought (and was granted) an adjournment in these legal proceedings, pending judgment in a comparable case (referenced above) which NAMA understands has now clarified the legal position in the receiver&rsquo;s favour. Given the on-going litigation (which is hopefully reaching a final conclusion) you will appreciate that NAMA is not in a position to substantively engage in certain issues, which it is understood are the subject of disputed claims in the ongoing pending litigation.</p></reply>

The issue was also discussed at the most recent meeting of the NDIS Steering Group on April 13th, which included input from stakeholders. </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration. </p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any potential changes to the scheme in advance of these proposals.</p></reply>

However, by way of special derogation from the general rule, Ireland is permitted to continue to apply a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of all property both residential and commercial.   This is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive, and standstill provisions from 1991 mean that this reduced rate can be maintained but it cannot be reduced below 12%.</p>  <p>  A reduced rate for housing (below the &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo; of 13.5%  but no lower than 5%) is permitted under the Directive as part of social policy. Technically, it would be possible for Ireland to decide, on social policy grounds, to apply a reduced rate to the construction, repair and renovation of certain residential housing.  However, in accordance with the Directive, such a decision would not be permitted in relation to housing built for reasons other than social policy and non-residential construction.  Such a situation would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services depending on the customer.

Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering.</p><p>We have been working closely with our EU partners and fellow Member States in the adoption of sanctions in response to Russia&rsquo;s violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity.  Sanctions will not be cost-free for the EU and Ireland, but Russia&rsquo;s behaviour leaves no alternative.</p><p>However, notwithstanding these challenges, Ireland remains supportive of the two-pillar solution for the taxation of the digital economy reached globally at the OECD, an agreement to which we signed up along with over 130 other countries in October 2021.  The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly, and I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century.</p><p>My long-standing position is that the international tax system needs to adapt to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted internationally. This is a global issue which requires global action to solve in a coordinated way. The OECD agreement will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework based on a shared understanding of where value is created in digital business models.  This stability is essential for businesses to plan medium- and long-term investments, driving employment and economic growth.</p><p>Ireland has been very active in recent years in implementing international tax reforms. I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap (2018 and 2021 update) to set out our commitments made and the significant, concrete actions we have taken in response. My Department facilitates extensive engagement with stakeholders in advance of new legislative measures being introduced and this collaborative, transparent process provides certainty to businesses situated here and those considering investing into the future.</p><p>It is therefore my view that a considered, collaborative implementation of the Pillar Two minimum tax agreement, in conjunction with our EU and OECD partners, continues to be in the best interests, both of Ireland and of global businesses investing here.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.509.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500064#WRG03400"><p>The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices including home heating oil,  and for this reason it recently introduced a package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased energy prices on households. </p>  <p>  These measures built on measures already introduced in Budget 2022, provides support to all domestic electricity users via a &euro;200 energy credit and also provides targeted support to vulnerable households via the welfare system.  Low income households have received an overall increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during the most recent Fuel Allowance season as compared to the previous season taking the &euro;5 increase in the weekly payment introduced as part of the Budget last October, the &euro;125 lump sum payment provided earlier this year together and the &euro;100 extra May payment.  </p>  <p>  The Government also announced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. This measure, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10 March reducing the VAT inclusive excise duty on petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively. These reductions mitigate the cost of a fill of a 60 litre tank by some &euro;12 for petrol and &euro;9 for diesel. This assists all transport users, rural and urban, including commuters, business and farmers. These measures have been extended to 11 October 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO at an additional cost of &euro;97m. </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Government took the decision to reduce the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% until October 31, 2022, costing an estimated &euro;46m and resulting in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  </p>  <p>  I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to the "small benefit exemption". Where an employer provides an employee or director with a small benefit, that is, a voucher or a benefit (a tangible asset other than cash) with a value not exceeding &euro;500, that benefit will be exempt from Income Tax, PRSI and USC, provided all of the conditions, contained within section 112B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The conditions are as follows -</p>  <p>  - the incentive is provided in the form of a voucher or other non-cash item;</p>  <p>  - where the incentive provided is in the form of a voucher, this voucher must only be for the purchase of goods or services and must not be capable of being exchanged in part or in full for cash;</p>  <p>  - the value of the incentive does not exceed &euro;500; and</p>  <p>  - the incentive does not form part of a salary sacrifice arrangement.</p>  <p>  Where all of the conditions are not satisfied, the exemption does not apply and the benefit is subject to tax in the usual way, in accordance with section 112 TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Revenue has in certain circumstances concessionally waived the requirement that only one voucher issues per year for the 2020 and 2021 tax years and has permitted an employer to issue two vouchers to the (maximum) value of &euro;500.  This concessionary treatment continues to apply for 2022. It applies where the additional award is related to an employee's exceptional efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and where the employee continued to work during the restricted period.</p>  <p>  All other conditions of section 112B TCA 1997 must be met, for example the maximum cumulative value of incentives must not exceed &euro;500 and the voucher or incentive must not be redeemable, in full or in part, for cash.  Appropriate documentation must be retained by an employer where this concession is availed of.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

The best interests of consumers are protected and confidence and trust in the financial system is enhanced through effective regulation of firms and markets. </p>  <p>  In line with the its mandate, the Central Bank intervened with a number of lenders between 2008 and 2015 in relation to tracker mortgages, requiring, among other things, certain lenders to offer affected customers the right to return to a tracker rate and/or payment of redress and compensation while at the same time strengthening the regulatory protections for tracker mortgage customers. The Central Bank launched the Tracker Mortgage Examination (TME) in December 2015 after it became clear, through combined supervisory and enforcement work and from information from consumer advocates, members of the public and public representatives, that tracker issues could potentially be industry wide.</p>  <p>  The TME required all lenders to review their loan book to ensure compliance with both regulatory and contractual requirements in relation to tracker mortgages. Where impacted customers were identified, the Central Bank expected that those customers receive redress and compensation in line with the detriment suffered. Approximately 42,000 customers have been identified as impacted by tracker failures by their lender and &euro;737m in redress and compensation has been paid to those customers by their lenders. </p>  <p>  While the supervisory phase of the TME concluded with the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tracker Mortgage Examination Final Report&rdquo; in July 2019, the Central Bank continues to monitor the outcomes of any complaints, appeals and court cases. Any person who is still not satisfied with the outcome of their engagement with their lender in relation to the tracker mortgage issue may take their individual case to the independent Financial Services and Ombudsman&rsquo; Office.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement investigations and actions build on the TME and further demonstrate its commitment to its consumer protection mandate.</p>  <p>  To date, the Central Bank has concluded five enforcement actions against firms relating to tracker mortgage-related failings identified under the Tracker Mortgage Examination, imposing fines totalling &euro;173.8 million. </p>  <p>  The TME and the imposition of significant fines on lenders send strong signals to lenders that misconduct on their part will have serious consequences.</p>  <p>  It is also important that our legislative and regulatory framework is fully up to date and that senior banking executives can be held to account.  The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill, which will introduce a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) for the financial services industry, will be key to this. This Bill will be published later this month.</p></reply>

This includes matters in relation to issues of quantum, which are still before the Courts. The Government&rsquo;s consistent view has been that insurers should engage with impacted businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour the terms of the policy cover, in line with the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and other relevant regulations. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I would note that the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework sets out its expectations of insurance firms in handling COVID-19-related business interruption claims. Where customers have an entitlement to claim under such a policy, my expectation is that these will be processed, paid promptly and in full. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has stated that a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling claims as a result of its supervisory interventions, and I welcome recent data that as at 30 April 2022, more than &euro;179 million has been paid to 5,482 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments. This figure includes 4,635 claims which have been fully settled, and 847 who have received interim payments. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has indicated that it will continue to work in line with the Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework, which sets out that where legal action results in an outcome that has a beneficial impact for similar customers, all relevant firms are required to take urgent action to ensure those customers benefit from the final outcome. While the vast majority of claims are now closed, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland will continue to monitor the outcome of any remaining test cases in the Courts, including the FBD test case on quantum and will act swiftly should any of these judgments have a wider beneficial impact for similarly impacted groups of customers.</p></reply>

ISIF invests across a range of strategic priorities including Housing and Enabling Investments, Climate Action, scaling Irish companies and supporting the Food and Agriculture sector. A focus on regional investment to support balanced growth has been and remains an important element of ISIF&rsquo;s strategy. </p>  <p>  ISIF recently launched a new initiative as a cornerstone of its investment strategy &ndash; this new initiative will result in major investment being targeted in each of Ireland&rsquo;s regional cities in the form of new places to work, places to live and enabling investments resulting in regeneration of our regional city centres. ISIF will also target investments at emerging and scaling businesses in the regions and other opportunities to support sustainable growth. ISIF already has a significant track record of investing in the regions and I am advised that ISIF has a currently active pipeline of investments which include a significant number of investments across the regions.</p>  <p>  Although the NTMA comes under my remit, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in individual ISIF transactions or ISIF&rsquo;s commercial decision making, more generally. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) was established by statute under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014. The Act also established an independent Investment Committee to oversee the implementation of ISIF's investment strategy.</p></reply>

The importance of this is emphasised in all engagements with the banks and my officials and I will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders, both public and private, to ensure that impacted customers face the least amount of disruption in migrating their accounts over the coming months.</p>  <p>  In relation to the setting up of new accounts, Credit and Financial Institutions are obliged to identify and verify their customer&rsquo;s identity on the basis of documents or information that they have reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identify of their customer.  Institutions often use official documents, like passports or driving licences, in order to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity.  However, neither the relevant legislation (the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended), nor the Central Bank of Ireland are prescriptive as to what documents and information can be relied upon.  This reflects the risk-based approach to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance and supervision. Accordingly, institutions have some flexibility in regards to the forms of identity documentation they may wish to rely upon.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the AML/CFT legal framework is sufficiently flexible to allow institutions to accommodate both financial inclusion and effective risk management through reliance on various forms of identification.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code, the Central Bank expects that all regulated firms take a consumer-focused approach and act in their customers&rsquo; best interests:</p>  <p>  - Provision 2.11 of the Code provides that a regulated firm must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. This provision aims to ensure that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services. </p>  <p>  - Provision 3.1 of the Code provides that &ldquo;where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I would also advise the Deputy that all of the banks have dedicated customer phone numbers for vulnerable customers to support them as required.</p></reply>

The Central Bank may either approve (in full or at lower levels than requested) or reject a credit institution&rsquo;s application under Section 149. In fulfilling its statutory role under Section 149, the Central Bank assesses these notifications in accordance with the following specific assessment criteria as set out in the legislation: </p><p>- the promotion of fair competition; </p><p>- the commercial justification; </p><p>- the effect new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers; and </p><p>- passing on costs to customers. </p><p>Approvals are issued in the form of a letter of direction and the entity is legally bound to comply with this letter of direction. The letter of direction sets out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge. Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons. The letter of direction also sets out that credit institutions must publish the charges to be imposed on notices, leaflets, and promotional material etc. which should be made available to customers and on the credit institutions website if appropriate (the withdrawal of the fees will also be notified to the relevant customers prior to withdrawal).</p><p>Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Consumer Protection Code, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect. </p><p>If customers are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost, it may be useful to know that Competition and Consumer Protection Commission operates a comparison tool for current account fees on its website.

No. 56/1981 amended the existing Civil Service Widows' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme and provided for the admission of established female civil servants to the scheme on terms equivalent to those applicable to male civil servants from 1 June 1981. In effect, that scheme then became the Spouses' and Children's Pension Scheme.</p>  <p>  Membership of this scheme then applied to female officers in either of the following two categories:</p>  <p>  (a) Those who were serving, or commenced to serve, in an established capacity at any time between 1 March 1980 and 31 May 1981, who did not opt out of the scheme and whose benefits take the form of a pension, lump sum and death gratuity rather than pension only.</p>  <p>  (b) Those appointed to established posts on or after 1 June 1981.</p>  <p>  If an individual who has been married during their scheme membership has not made periodic contributions from salary in respect of all pensionable service, non-periodic contributions are payable at retirement in respect of the outstanding &lsquo;relevant service&rsquo;, up to a maximum of 40 years. This relevant service can include pre-scheme service, depending on the periodic contributions which have been paid at the time of retirement. These non-periodic contributions will prevent a shortfall of scheme contributions and are usually deducted from the retirement lump sum at a rate of 1% of retiring salary for each year of relevant service.</p></reply>

This scheme will support the live entertainment sector by providing business re-start grants to de-risk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022 and to assist with the costs of reopening. Grants of &euro;14.7m have been offered under LPRGS to date. </p>  <p>  - &euro;1m was provided to support the St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival.</p>  <p>  - The Local Live Public Performance Scheme (LLPPS) Phase 3 has provided funding of &euro;5m to Local Authorities to support local live events.  These events will continue to run until the end of June this year.  Given the success of the scheme I recently allocated a further &euro;5m to the local authorities to provide for live events until Halloween. </p>  <p>  In relation to smaller businesses i.e. with turnover less than &euro;100,000, the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) 2022 was also launched earlier this year as part of a suite of measures I put in place to support the live entertainment sector.  MEBAS 2022 is a targeted support for self-employed performers and sole traders with a VAT exclusive turnover of &euro;15,000 or over operating solely in the live entertainment sector who did not qualify for other business supports such as CRSS and who were significantly impacted by restrictions introduced to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  To date, over &euro;2.27m has been paid under this scheme. </p>  <p>  The funding delivered through this suite of supports I believe has been essential to help underpin the recovery of the sector post pandemic.  I am pleased to see that hundreds of events and gigs are  happening across the country and with the worst of the pandemic now behind us, artists, crews and event producers and promoters are back to doing what they do best.</p></reply>

However, my Department does not provide funding for the ongoing operational cost of swimming pools or leisure centres. My Department&rsquo;s direct role in relation to swimming pools is primarily related to providing capital support for the development of such facilities. The day to day financial management of public swimming pools is a matter for the operators of the facilities themselves. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic however, my Department provided funding of &euro;2.5 million in 2020 to support publicly accessible swimming pools in responding to the challenges associated with maintaining swimming pools and re-opening within Covid-19 safety protocols. A further amount of &euro;3.2 million was provided in 2021 for this purpose in recognition of the importance of the sector and the positive impact swimming has on the nation&rsquo;s health. The funding was administered by Ireland Active on behalf of Sport Ireland and supported 280 pools throughout the country including the pool referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Recent global events, including the invasion of Ukraine, have led to a rise in energy costs.

Initial preparatory work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard. It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to take forward the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year. Any recommendations in this strategy will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

Where a construction product, covered by a harmonised standard (includes concrete blocks, aggregates for concrete and cement), is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised (including concrete blocks, aggregates for concrete), and non-harmonised standards (concrete to I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021), in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) and National Annexes which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department recently published &lsquo;A Guide to the Marketing and Use of Aggregate Concrete Blocks to EN 771-3 in Ireland&rsquo; which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This guide aims to facilitate clearer communication within the supply chain regarding the declared performance of essential characteristics of concrete blocks having regard to national provisions in Ireland. Guidance is also provided for specifiers, designers, builders, certifiers and end users who when specifying and choosing aggregate concrete blocks, they should ensure that the construction products are fit for intended use and the conditions in which they are to be used. Appropriate specifications and choices will help secure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021.</p>  <p>  While the CPR came into force in July 2013 and has direct legal application across the entire European Union, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011.</p>  <p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, (NBC&amp;MSO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. Building control authorities liaise with NBC&amp;MSO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by NBC&amp;MSO to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR. The 2022 programme is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to focus on the extractive industries sector and expand upon the programme commenced in 2021.</p>  <p>  In October of last year I requested a Market Surveillance Audit of all quarries in Donegal which was carried out by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office in partnership with Donegal County Council and Geological Survey Ireland. I received a report of this audit at the end of June and am currently examining its contents.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives above, Market Surveillance Authorities respond to complaints raised.  Therefore any information on suspected non-compliance should be submitted in writing (detailing as much information as possible) to either the appropriate local Market Surveillance Authority and/or the National Building Control Office and Market Surveillance Office (NBC&amp;MSO). The Local Market Surveillance Authority may be contacted through the City or County Council. NBC&amp;MSO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Separately,  in relation to the manufacture and supply of concrete, while it is covered by a European standard  I.S. EN 206-1:2013+A2:2021, this is not a harmonised standard within the scope of the CPR. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of an Irish National Annex, which specifies among other requirements, the recommended limiting values required for concrete mixes for the various exposure classes. These values are applicable to the specification or use of concrete in Ireland. I.S. EN 206-1+A2:2021 places significant responsibility upon manufacturers of ready-mix concrete to demonstrate conformity to a series of specified requirements.</p>  <p>  NSAI has also put in place a product certification scheme covering ready-mix concrete. This entails an initial inspection of the concrete plant focusing on:</p>  <p>  -  The production control manual and the degree of conformity to I.S. EN 206&ndash;1 and National Annex;</p>  <p>  -  Inspection of relevant documentation,</p>  <p>  -  Facilities and equipment,</p>  <p>  -  Staff training, experience and knowledge,</p>  <p>  -  Issuing a Certificate of Conformity.</p>  <p>  All the relevant information from the initial inspection and assessment of the system is documented in an NSAI Assessment Report. This report will be issued after the plant has passed the initial inspection, along with a Certificate of Conformity to I.S. EN 206-1:2002 and Irish National Annex.</p>  <p>  To maintain certification, qualified NSAI personnel will continue to carry out regular inspections. As a minimum, the following will be examined:</p>  <p>  -  Sampling and testing procedures,</p>  <p>  -  Recorded data,</p>  <p>  -  Test results obtained for production control during the inspection period,</p>  <p>  -  Frequency of required tests or procedures,</p>  <p>  -  Scheduled production equipment checks and maintenance,</p>  <p>  -  Scheduled test equipment maintenance and calibration,</p>  <p>  -  Actions taken with respect to any non-conformity,</p>  <p>  -  Delivery tickets, and the Declaration of Conformity where relevant,</p>  <p>  -  Maintenance of the production control system.</p>  <p>  NSAI also take ongoing spot samples to verify the accuracy of the producer&rsquo;s routine testing procedures.  Where significant changes are made to facilities at the production place, system or manual, the producer must notify these changes to NSAI. Following review, NSAI may determine that an on-site re-inspection is appropriate.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Building Regulations, the overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations 1997-2021 requires that all works should be carried out:</p>  <p>  -  Using proper materials which are fit for the use for  which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p>  <p>  -  With a proper standard of workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the  requirements of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  -  By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations 1997-2021 rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Interpretation of the legislation is, ultimately, a matter for the Courts and implementation of the Building Control system is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  The Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2022, which will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing, is currently going through the legislative process in the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted shortly.  Its main objective is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register is critical for the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p></reply>

The local authority, or approved housing body, pays for the repairs upfront and the home is taken into social housing stock by way of lease for between 5 and 25 years. The cost of repairs is offset against reduced lease payments to the property owner and therefore has a neutral cost to the Exchequer.

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December and my Department has been working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans are in the process of being published by each local authority on their websites.</p></reply>

This will end the unsatisfactory reliance on Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) whereby councillors who take a maternity related absence are not noted on the record for that purpose, as well as the requirement to obtain a Council resolution for a councillor seeking to extend her maternity leave beyond 6 months.</p>  <p>  In its decision, Government recognised that the councillor role is both unique and demanding in that it is difficult to step away from the role for a lengthy absence, such as to take maternity leave. Government, therefore, approved the proposal that elected members would have the option to nominate an individual as a temporary substitute when they take a period of maternity-related absence or indeed are absent due to illness or in good faith for another reason.</p>  <p>  Provision will therefore be required in the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) to allow the possibility of the appointment by co-option of an individual as a temporary substitute for an elected member who takes a period of maternity-related absence under the Maternity Protection Act 1994, or is absent due to illness or in good faith for another reason under Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended). The temporary substitution would be initiated using a process of co-option similar to that provided for in Section 19 of the 2001 Act.  The member causing the temporary absence, whether or not they are aligned to a political party, would have an input in the nomination of the temporary substitute.</p>  <p>  Preparation of the general scheme is being prioritised. Once approved by Government, the general scheme will be forwarded for drafting of a Bill. </p></reply>

Over the past two years, the RTB has been engaging across various stakeholders listed and indeed others, about the change to annual registration and has established a short-term working group with IPAV which has met on a fortnightly basis since the start of April.</p>  <p>  The RTB has created online support materials  such as videos and FAQs for landlord customers to support them to understand the online registration system and annual registration requirements, which can be found on its website at: www.rtb.ie/annual-registration.</p>  <p>  Full details of the RTB&rsquo;s complaints procedure is outlined in their Customer Charter and is available to download from their website at:</p>  <p> www.rtb.ie/rtb-freedom-of-information-publication-scheme/customer-charter</p>  <p>  Should further information be required by the Deputy, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose and may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie.</p></reply>

The aim of the Building Regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The Building Regulations apply to the design and construction of a new building (including a dwelling) and certain works to an existing building.</p>  <p>   The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each part indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.</p>  <p>   There is an overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations which requires that all works should be carried out:</p>  <p>  - Using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p>  <p>  - With a proper standard of  workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  - By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for enforcement is delegated to local building control authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers and any person who believes that an offence has been committed is encouraged to report this to the local building control authority in whose area the offence is alleged to have been committed. Building control authorities have strong powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. In addition, local authorities also have similar powers under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, which may be relevant where concerns arise in residential developments.</p>  <p>  Authorised officers of each local building control authority have delegated powers to: -</p>  <p>  - scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;</p>  <p>  - serve enforcement notices on owners and builders for non-compliance;</p>  <p>  - institute proceedings for breaches of any requirements outlined in the Acts, or any</p>  <p>  - regulations made thereunder; and seek High Court orders to mitigate danger to the public where serious non-compliance poses risks to public safety.</p>  <p>  Failure by an owner or a builder, at the request of a building control authority, to demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations or the Building Control Regulations, or to rectify any such non-compliance, may be an offence under the Building Control Acts. If successfully prosecuted in court, such offences may lead to a fine and/or a term of imprisonment.  The use of these powers is, however, subject to a statute of limitations of five years from the date of completion of the buildings concerned.</p>  <p>  Other significant pieces of redress and producers&rsquo; liability legislation which may apply to construction products are the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the stressful circumstances which the owners and residents of buildings face when defects occur in their homes.  In this regard, the Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of addressing building defects. These include a commitment to  examine defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report "Safe as Houses?" and to assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects, to access lowcost, long-term finance. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings have taken place to advance elements of the work.  The group&rsquo;s terms of reference are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013. </p>  <p>  The working group is currently concluding its deliberations in support of the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and working towards finalisation of its report.  Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

The Scheme will primarily support first-time buyers in buying a new home, subject to designated price ceilings set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area. However, the Government's 'Fresh Start' principle for some previous homeowners will also apply. As equity support will only be available to those with a genuine gap between the resources available to them and the price of the home they wish to buy, this will ensure funding will be targeted where it is needed most. </p>  <p>  The State will operate the First Home Scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, and it is planned that the Scheme will launch imminently.

Officials in my Department have been engaging with the Parliamentary Drafter on the Bill, including with regard to the incorporation of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee in such a way that they will build on the work of the Implementation Advisory Group for the Limerick mayor project.</p>  <p>  Drafting of this complex Bill is at an advanced stage and publication of the Bill has been identified as a priority for my Department as soon as practicable in 2022. The time frame for its passage through the legislative process will then be a matter for the Oireachtas, having regard to the overall Government legislative programme. </p>  <p>  The timing of an election for mayor of Limerick will then be a matter for Government once the legislation is enacted. </p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. </p>  <p>  Childcare facilities that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) for children of pre-school age are deemed to be exempt from rates.

Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.687.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500067#WRM03375"><p>The zoning of land for particular uses, including housing, is an exercise undertaken as part of the overall statutory development plan function under sections 9-13 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended).  Under this legislation, the decision to zone land for development is a reserved function of the elected members of each planning authority.  This includes the zoning of lands for residential development in order to meet the housing supply target identified in the administrative area of the local authority.</p>  <p>  The statutory Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities published under section 28 of the Planning Act by my Department on 1st July 2022, set out national policies and objectives in relation to the zoning of land.  The guidelines state that land already zoned for residential purposes may be regarded as providing a baseline, or starting point to meet projected population and housing targets, especially in cases where planning permission has already been granted, based on the presumption that land subject to planning permission is already serviced or serviceable.  Where there is a surplus of well-located zoned and fully serviced land already zoned for development, it is recommended best practice that a phased approach be taken to prioritise the preferred sequence of development of such sites.  </p>  <p>  It is only in cases where land is zoned and has remained undeveloped and unserviced through one or more development plan cycles, with no prospect of being serviced within the six-year life of the development plan, alternative approaches, including discontinuing the zoning objective, must be considered as it is important that zoned land can be developed as intended, during the life of the plan to ensure that there is sufficient residential land available to meet identified housing needs.  This is supported by the provision in section 10 of the Act that there shall be no presumption that any land zoned for development in a development plan shall remain so zoned in any subsequent plan. </p>  <p>  The new Development Plan guidelines also provide that in certain instances a planning authority may provide zoned residential sites in addition to those required to meet the housing supply target for a settlement in order to ensure that sufficient choice for development potential is safeguarded.</p>  <p>  The Residential Zoned Land tax (RZLT) introduced by the Finance Act 2021 seeks to encourage the activation of development on lands which are suitably zoned and appropriately serviced and will impose a tax on landowners who fail to bring such lands forward for development.  My Department published section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Residential Zoned Land Tax on 29th June 2022.  This tax measure is aligned to the sequential and phased approach to the development of zoned land outlined in the Development Plan Guidelines, with a clear incentive to bring forward land which has had the benefit of investment in the key infrastructure required to support housing. It will also allow other infrastructure providers such as those providing social and community infrastructure to have greater clarity on the likely locations for housing development to take place.</p>  <p>  One of the key priorities of the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the compact growth of cities and towns of all sizes.  This objective seeks to support the sustainable development of our cities and towns as attractive and vibrant places.  The NPF targets 40 percent of future growth to take place in the existing built up area of cities and towns.  This target will be met by a combination of development on zoned housing land, and by increasing the proportion of development that takes place on infill and brownfield development sites within existing urban areas.  The NPF recognises that this change will not be achieved from the outset and allows for transition over time.  </p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the NPF and the subsequent Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies,, a process of reviewing city and county development plans by individual planning authorities is now underway.  When complete, this will be the first time that there has been an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans, shaping the future pattern and form of development in Ireland.</p></reply>

This had become necessary as some local authorities were introducing requirements and standards that diverged significantly from national policy guidance and legislation (e.g. apartment sizes and building performance standards) in their plans, resulting in a highly variable and inconsistent planning policy framework, in some cases within different parts of the same urban area.</p>  <p>  The objective of guidelines issued under section 28 of the 2000 Act, and SPPRs in particular, is to achieve consistency of approach on critical matters throughout the hierarchy of plans at national, regional and local levels, in support of national policy objectives. Their use is limited and specific to clearly articulating Government policy and ensuring a consistency of application across the planning system.</p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF) sets out the vision and strategic objectives to support Ireland&rsquo;s national, regional and local spatial development in economic, environmental and social terms to 2040. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, regional plans and plans developed by planning authorities must have regard to and be consistent with the objectives of the NPF. </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department published the updated Sustainable Urban Housing Development Guidelines to respond to changing housing need, in light of emerging dynamics in the urban employment market and ongoing demographic trends. The 2018 Guidelines addressed in particular, the relatively new build-to-rent sector and sets out a number of key distinct characteristics of such development. Further, related guidance has been subsequently issued in the form of updates to the Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities, most recently in 2020, which while introducing a presumption against 'co-living' accommodation in most circumstances, has retained 'build-to-rent' (BTR) development as a distinct planning category.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Apartment Guidelines specifically, the specific planning policy requirements included seek to enable reinforce the national policy objective of providing more compact forms of urban development as outlined in the NPF through increasing the density, scale and heights of buildings, including apartments, in appropriate locations. Those regarding BTR facilitate an element of tenure choice at particular types of location.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that by the end of 2022, the vast majority of city and county development plans will have been reviewed and a greater consistency of approach will be provided in those development plans to achieve more dense patterns of development in appropriate locations, given the need for planning authorities to have regard to these Guidelines and to comply with relevant SPPRs contained within them. This will also coincide with the significant advancement of the Attorney General-led review of the Planning Act.</p>  <p>  It is not currently proposed to repeal the provisions, which are considered to provide an important role in the integration of national policy within the planning hierarchy of plans from national to regional and local levels. The Planning and Development Act 2000 is currently being reviewed by the Attorney General, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and any necessary amendments to current legislative arrangements will, where appropriate, be considered in this context. </p></reply>

It has been previously confirmed that the provision of support under the scheme will be subject to regional price ceilings set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in each area. The price ceilings for the Scheme will be confirmed upon the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.</p>  <p>  The setting of the initial First Home Scheme price ceilings has been informed primarily by an analysis of published current CSO data, specifically the Residential Property Price Index (RPPI), together with a review on live market data and sales prices for new homes by first-time buyers.   Price ceilings will be set to temper inflationary pressures and to target support at the lower part of the price distribution in each area.</p>  <p>  Any system of geographically-based price ceilings will require defined borders. Inevitably, this will result in examples of homes on either side of given borders with differing price ceilings. However, when considered in the overall, I am confident the system will broadly reflect price trends, and represent a clear, easily understandable method for utilising appropriate price ceilings.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will keep any ceilings under review to ensure they allow the scheme to deliver on its underlying objectives.</p></reply>

In place of an outright ban or prohibition on metal detecting to search for archaeological objects, such activities are instead subject to a regulatory regime. That regulatory regime was introduced under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 to address the major damage to archaeological sites and monuments, and substantial loss of important archaeological objects, which had occurred as a result of uncontrolled metal detecting in the 1970's and 1980's. The removal of the existing regulatory structure would be considered a retrograde step that could place our national archaeological heritage in jeopardy.</p>  <p>  In addition, under Article 3 of the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (which was ratified by Ireland in 1997) parties to the Convention are required to &ldquo;subject to specific prior authorisation, whenever foreseen by the domestic law of the State, the use of metal detectors and any other detection equipment or process for archaeological investigation&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The proposed Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill will continue the approach of regulating the use of detection devices for archaeological purposes, in particular searching for archaeological objects. I am satisfied that this represents a necessary, reasonable and proportionate approach to an activity which, unfortunately, could result in the damage to or loss of our national archaeological heritage.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that my officials in the National Monuments Service have met with representatives of the Irish Metal Detecting Society (IMDS) on several occasions, and (along with staff of the National Museum of Ireland) have had several detailed discussions with IMDS in 2014 and again in 2019. In these engagements, my officials have indicated that they would endeavour, if requested by IMDS, to facilitate partnership arrangements between interested metal detectorists and professional archaeologists, under which metal detectorists could be involved in appropriately regulated research work under the necessary professional supervision. The National Monuments Service of my Department remains available to engage with IMDS to discuss such proposals in further detail.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to that person.  In order to meet this requirement, each passport applicant must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement when making a first time passport application.</p><p>For a person born outside the island of Ireland who does not have British or Irish parents or grandparents, citizenship can be established by obtaining a naturalisation certificate from the Department of Justice. Once a person has obtained a naturalisation certificate they can then apply for an Irish passport, submitting the original naturalisation certificate along with the following supporting documents: </p><p>- Identity verification form.</p><p>- Full original civil birth certificate (version that includes the name(s) of the parent(s)).</p><p>- Original Civil marriage or Civil Partnership certificate (if applying for a passport in your married name).</p><p>- Proof of address such as Government correspondence, such as a letter from the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners. If you do not have these,  original utility bills, or bank statements can be considered.</p><p>- Proof of name such as  Government correspondence such as a letter from the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners. If you do not have these,  original utility bills, or bank statements can be considered.</p><p>- You must submit one document as proof of name and one document as proof of address. It cannot be the same document.</p><p>- Government issued photographic identification.</p><p>In relation to the applicant's children, if they were born on the island of Ireland before 2005 they are automatically an Irish citizen.</p><p>The citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the citizenship or residency status of one of their parents at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth. If both parents are non-Irish citizens at the time of the child's birth and if neither of the parents are a British citizen, the citizenship of a child born in Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the residency status of one of the parents at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. A child born on or after 1 January 2005 may claim citizenship by birth where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his/her birth (a total of 1,095 days).</p><p>In order to prove this residency period of one of the parents when applying for a passport on behalf of their child, the parent must provide acceptable documentary evidence. The documents required to prove the residency period vary depending on whether the parent was an EU or non-EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth.</p><p>If the parent was an EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, as in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, it is necessary to rely on the following list of documents to prove the parent&rsquo;s residency in Ireland for three of the four years before the child&rsquo;s birth (not all of the documents on the list may be required in every case):</p><p>- Tax records (P60 / P45 / P35L / Employment Detail Summary) for each year showing at least 35 weeks insurable employment. </p><p>- Notice of Assessment / Self Assessment records for each year and supporting documentation e.g. bank statements / domestic bills for each month</p><p>- Letter from Social Welfare/Intreo confirming type of benefit payment received and the dates to and from when the benefit was paid directly, this must be accompanied by a photocopy of parent&rsquo;s PPS card front and back</p><p>- Rent Lease (must include contract page and signature of the parent whose residency is being considered) with receipts / utility bills/ rent book to confirm payments for each month</p><p>- Bank statements for each month showing regular transactions in and out of the account</p><p>- School/college letters confirming dates of attendance, full time courses undertaken and proof of exam results</p><p>- Declaration Form A: This is a sworn statement by the parent, giving details of their period of residency in Ireland. </p><p>Information on what is required for all first time passport applications, including details on documentary requirements, guardianship and consent, are available at my Department&rsquo;s recently updated website (www.dfa.ie/passports/documentary-requirements/).</p><p>I advise all first time applicants to apply online, as it is by far the quickest and fastest way to make an application. The current processing time for first time online passport applications is 25 working days. Turnaround time starts from the date that supporting documents are received by the Passport Service, not the date the online application is made.</p></reply>

Ireland raises issues of compliance with international law in our bilateral contacts with the Government of Israel and in multilateral fora. </p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council, Ireland set out our position most recently on 27 June at the Security Council Briefing on the Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question. Ireland raised the issues of the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, including at Masafer Yatta, and evictions and demolitions. Additionally, Ireland raised the economic difficulties for the Palestinian people and our concern regarding Israel&rsquo;s designations of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations. Ireland also reiterated our concern that Israeli authorities have not yet conducted a criminal investigation into the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.</p>  <p>  If a resolution on reconvening the Special Committee on Apartheid is tabled at the United Nations, Ireland will give consideration to it in co-ordination with our EU partners. </p>  <p>  With regard to co-operation with Israel, Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the State of Israel and the territory occupied since 1967, in line with international law and the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Ireland ensures that bilateral agreements with Israel do not apply to territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and this position is common across Government departments.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to our relations with Israel is fully consistent with our obligations under international law. </p></reply>

Evidence of this for at least two years through documentation such as bills/bank statements/official correspondence is required as a deed poll is not adequate evidence of the constant use of a new name.

We believe that the Security Council has an important role to play, given the impact on national and regional peace and security.  Since the conflict began in November 2020, there have been 14 meetings of the Council on Ethiopia. Ireland has played a leading role on the Council, particularly in negotiating statements that, despite difficult dynamics, have achieved unanimous support in calling for unhindered humanitarian access, a ceasefire and a national dialogue. Ireland has also repeatedly raised the need for accountability for the widespread human rights abuses and atrocities that have been committed by all sides in the conflict.  </p>  <p>  Ethiopia was most recently discussed at the Security Council on 14 April, when the focus was on the humanitarian situation.  At that meeting, Ireland called for immediate implementation of the recently agreed humanitarian truce, and delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need.  </p>  <p>  Putting Ethiopia on the formal agenda of the Council would require support around the table, and the reality is that some members of the Council do not want this. We will nevertheless continue to raise the situation in Ethiopia as necessary. Responding to the acute humanitarian crisis in Tigray and Ethiopia more generally will remain an urgent priority for Ireland during our term on the Council and beyond. </p>  <p>  Minister Coveney continues to engage on the situation in Ethiopia with key interlocutors in the region including African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo, whose role in helping find a solution to the conflict we fully support. Minister Coveney met with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen in February, and stressed the need for full humanitarian access and an end to hostilities; restoration of basic services; and political dialogue. We continue to advocate for an effective response to the situation through a full range of regular and ongoing contacts with Ethiopia, including in Addis Ababa, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, as well as in EU forums in Brussels.  </p>  <p>  I welcome some recent positive developments in Ethiopia, including the declaration of a humanitarian truce and ceasefire, and reported willingness by both sides to engage in talks towards finding a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict. This opportunity for peace must be seized. However, despite the increased humanitarian access, we remain concerned that this still falls far short of meeting needs. Essential services such as banking and telecommunications remain cut off &ndash; it is critical that these are restored and that secure, unhindered and complete humanitarian access is ensured urgently. </p>  <p>  Horrifying reports of gross human rights violations, including widespread sexual violence, have defined the conflict in Tigray. These are unacceptable and must end while perpetrators must be held to account. The publication on 3 November of the findings of the joint investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in Tigray was a vital first step towards accountability. We must see the full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and progress on investigations into these appalling crimes, as well as continued attention on ongoing abuses. Ireland also supports the decision of the Human Rights Council in December to establish an international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia and welcomes the recent appointment of the members of the Commission. Ireland believes this will be complementary to domestic efforts and encourages all parties to cooperate with the Commission and to allow it full unimpeded access to the country. I welcome indications from the Ethiopian government of their willingness to engage with the Commission.</p></reply>

Ireland supports refugees both through direct action and through our engagement with multilateral fora such as the EU and the UN. </p>  <p>  The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees worldwide and safeguard their rights and well-being, and is a key funding partner of Irish Aid. UNHCR also assists former refugees who have returned to their homeland, internally displaced people, and people who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed. In December 2021, Ireland pledged contributions of &euro;18 million to UNHCR for 2022. Ireland&rsquo;s total contributions for 2022 are set to exceed this pledge by &euro;5 million, as a result of our support to UNHCR&rsquo;s response to the Ukraine Crisis and its impact across the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also a permanent member of UNHCR&rsquo;s Executive Committee (governing board) and the Department of Foreign Affairs engages on an ongoing basis with UNHCR throughout the year. UNHCR also have a major donors group for those who provide over $20m per year and thus receive additional briefings in Geneva - Ireland has been a member of this group since 2020.  </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to play its part and to encourage others to provide a safe haven for people fleeing conflict and crises and who are in need of protection and humanitarian support. Since the onset of the war in Ukraine Minister Coveney has engaged closely and regularly with his counterparts across the European Union, calling for a collective effort in terms of supporting the millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing war and violence. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a staunch advocate for the rights of refugees at the EU, including in the context of refugee and migratory movements into and between EU Member States. We fully support EU efforts to deal with migration and displacement in a comprehensive and holistic manner, including through refugee resettlement; increased legal pathways for migration; addressing root causes of irregular migration and reforming the Common European Asylum System.</p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States recognise and are bound to the principle of non-refoulement, as enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and both Ireland and the EU regularly make that position clear and remind other States of their obligations. Ireland has repeatedly highlighted the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among EU Member States in dealing with the issue of migration.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s role on the UN Security Council also provides an important opportunity advance our foreign policy priorities, including the promotion and protection of human rights.  During our time on the Council, we have consistently worked to uphold international human rights law and International Humanitarian Law, including by advocating for the rights and protection of refugees.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to be able to participate in a High Level Meeting in December which took stock of progress made in achieving the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees, including through the pledges and contributions made and initiatives announced at the first Global Refugee Forum in 2019. In addition to fulfilling our pledges to support UNHCR I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s progress in other areas including our commitment to address the root causes of displacement through support of &euro;4.5m for global peacebuilding initiatives. In 2021 Minister Coveney pledged to increase Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the UN Peacebuilding Fund to &euro;10 million over the period 2020-2024. Furthermore, Ireland has fulfilled and exceeded its pledge to increase support for education in emergencies and protracted crises. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also pledged to welcome 2,900 refugees during the period from 2020-2023 under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. This new phase of the programme will build on the important work undertaken since 2015, and is a vital part of upholding our responsibilities in helping those fleeing the most harrowing of circumstances such as war and persecution.</p></reply>

Many of the actions have been delivered, others are ongoing, and new policy instruments are continually reviewed and introduced. In July 2020, a human trafficking stakeholders&rsquo; forum was established with NGOs and statutory agencies to facilitate structured dialogue on how Ireland&rsquo;s response to human trafficking can be further enhanced.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has taken proactive steps to raise awareness of and mitigate any potential risk of trafficking in the context of people arriving into Ireland having fled the war in Ukraine, working with the International Office for Migration (IOM).</p></reply>

Ireland has consistently supported the development of a more comprehensive range of tools by the European Commission to ensure that EU Member States adhere to their rule of law obligations under the EU Treaties. This includes the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Rule of Law Report and the Rule of Law budget conditionality regulation. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the continuation of the Article 7 Treaty on European Union process at the General Affairs Council in relation to Hungary and Poland. The process offers a welcome opportunity for peer dialogue on rule of law challenges. Ireland has participated actively in the hearings held to date and will continue do so.</p>  <p>  Ireland broadly welcomes the recent agreement between Poland and the European Commission on milestones around the rule of law in relation to approval of Poland&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Plan. Ireland also supports the Commission&rsquo;s formal notification that the budget conditionality regulation will be activated in relation to Hungary. Our hope had been Hungary would engage constructively with those specific rule of law concerns identified by the Commission but regrettably this did not happen. </p>  <p>  Alongside the promotion of democracy and protection of human rights, strengthening the rule of law is one of the three pillars of the Council of Europe. As part of our current Presidency of the organisation, Ireland has prioritised support for institutions through which the Council of Europe delivers that mandate, above all the European Court of Human Rights. The Taoiseach visited the Court on 7 June 2022 to affirm the importance we attach to rule of law. Ireland also recently announced voluntary financial contributions of over &euro;865,000 to the Council, much of it directed to support the Court&rsquo;s work. </p>  <p>  Ireland is undertaking many initiatives through its Presidency to reinforce the rule of law across the European continent. The Chief Justice, Donal O&rsquo;Donnell, will host the President of the European Court of Human Rights, Justice Robert Spano, its Vice President, Justice Siofra O&rsquo;Leary, and other Justices from the Strasbourg Court for a two-day judicial conference in October 2022 to take place in Dublin City University. </p>  <p>  Ireland has worked consistently to promote respect for the rule of law in our engagement at the United Nations, including in relation to a number of countries in Europe. </p>  <p>  We play an active role in the annual sessions of the General Assembly&rsquo;s Sixth Committee, which has responsibility for Legal Affairs, and the Third Committee, which considers Human Rights and Social Affairs. We support a range of General Assembly resolutions dealing with human rights and rule of law issues, some of which specifically address Europe. Ireland is, for example, a longstanding co-sponsor of the annual Ukraine-led resolution on the Situation of human rights in Crimea. Earlier this year, we supported three General Assembly resolutions that were tabled in response to Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine, including one that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. </p></reply>

The aim of the plan is to address the issues facing the Naval Service in the context of human resources, operational capacity, and infrastructure. A number of the staffing measures in the plan have been implemented.</p>  <p>  Additionally, general service and direct entry recruitment is ongoing. 12 direct entry engine room artificer (ERA) applications have been received to date in 2022 and 5 ERA&rsquo;s have been inducted by direct entry over the past 3 years. Direct entry terms and conditions continue to be revised to improve intakes.  </p>  <p>  Specialists, such as ERA can prove difficult to retain as there are competing demands for such specialists in other sectors. In relation to retention measures to counter this, pay has improved as a result of increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report and from recent pay agreements.

The request is clearly defined in terms of the role and timeline, lasting no more than 6 weeks, in non-public facing duties.</p>  <p>  Members of our Defence Forces are undergoing an immediate period of training and will stand ready to assist if the need arises. The Defence Forces will only be deployed if assistance is requested by the daa and in a scenario where there is a significant deterioration in passenger queuing times with a risk of large numbers of passengers missing their flights. The support will be stood down in August when the busy holiday period has passed. The daa have given assurances that they will continue with their own recruitment and onboarding of additional security staff and the introduction of other mitigations during this period. </p>  <p>  The full details of this support are currently being worked out between the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the daa. This includes the modalities for the reimbursement to the Exchequer of all costs by the daa. The  support is being provided on the agreement that the daa will pay the full costs of the service provision, including salary costs, allowances, training, certification and management costs and the cost of having the Defence Forces personnel on standby.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence 2015 refers to utilising NATO as the standard and benchmark for the Defence Forces, it being the &lsquo;ISO of the military world&rsquo;. The Defence Forces involvement with OCC is a reflection of how they strive to reach that standard and benchmark.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces joined the OCC Programme in 2016. It is an aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Partnership for Peace, which is seen as fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligations in providing professional peacekeepers for multinational crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN.</p>  <p>  There is no membership fee associated with OCC. Since joining OCC, a total of 49 Defence Forces' personnel have attended OCC courses and events and a number have qualified as OCC evaluators.  Costs relating to attendance at training and other activities both home and overseas, such as travel and subsistence, are met from within the existing travel and training budget of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

More than 50% who leave the Defence Force do so with some form of pension. This can make taking up a position in the private sector very attractive where a full-time position, even at the same rates as those in the Defence Forces, could lead to an increase in an individual&rsquo;s earnings.</p><p>Additionally, recruits can also elect to discharge by purchase while still undergoing training and the average turnover rate for such recruits has been around 30% over the last number of years. The realities of military life and the training requirements are not always suitable for some recruits or in line with their expectations of the role. In any position where there is a training period prior to appointment there will always be fall off at different stages of the process.</p><p>While the Commission on the Defence Forces stated in their report that they were satisfied, in broad terms, that the levels of average turnover are not out of line with other military organisations internationally, its work included wider deliberation on the appropriate capabilities and staffing of the Permanent Defence Force. Consideration of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces is ongoing. I intend to revert shortly to Government with a proposed response to those recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p></reply>

The REALT also advise and support the Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to children and families across their defined area. These teams act as a liaison between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to Ukrainian arrivals. The REALTs are initially focusing on ensuring that children find school places when they are ready to engage with the school system. </p>  <p>  Current data available shows that overall there is significant capacity available at both primary and post-primary level.  I am aware that some schools in certain areas are oversubscribed. The REALTs are helping to manage this; they will identify schools with capacity, assist with accessing transport, and provide feedback to the Department on progress and challenges. </p>  <p>  Where a parent is experiencing difficulty finding a school place for their child, they should make contact with their local REALT team. Contact information for all REALT coordinators is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/48639-information-for-schools-ukraine/#regional-education-and-language-teams-realt.</p>  <p>  With regard to the child referred to by the Deputy, I am pleased to advise that the local REALT coordinator has been engaging with the family and a place has been secured for the child.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes.</p><p>The Model comprises a number of key elements in respect of building school capacity including the following:</p><p>-  Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p><p>-  Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis</p><p>-  Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>-  Training of SNAs</p><p>The initial pilot of the Model took place in 75 schools and 75 early learning centres located in the HSE CH07 area in the 2018/19 school year and this was positively evaluated.  The Model was then extended to facilitate further development and evaluation but this was disrupted by Covid-19 in March 2020 and the Pilot was then paused.  At this time, the HSE withdrew the speech and language and occupational therapists and redeployed them to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  </p><p>The Pilot has now recommenced in CHO7 and therapists are working within these schools and are providing ongoing support on a responsive basis to deliver therapy-based strategies and tools. Overall there is good engagement by the schools in CHO7. Where schools commented on the overall SIM project, they were positive about their experience and expectations of the In-School Therapy Project.</p><p>Planning for an expansion of the model is underway. The Department of Education is consulting with relevant Departments including the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Health and Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p><p>There are a number of challenges to expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single greatest constraint is insufficient supply of SLTs and OTs to meet health and education needs. The recruitment of therapists is also a significant issue for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>Some of the issues can be more easily addressed than others which require further consideration and planning work to identify an appropriate solution.</p><p>My officials are continuing to work through proposals to address the challenges.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply: </p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation. </p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE, ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p>  <p>  The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Council is comprised of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Education and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>The purpose of the Temporary Re-Assignment Scheme is to facilitate an arrangement between two eligible teachers who, with the approval of their respective employers, wish to apply for temporary re-assignment to a different school for educational purposes. The provisions of the Scheme are set out in Chapter 9 of Circular 0054/2019. </p><p>Paragraph 1.3 of the Circular states: </p><p>&ldquo; A teacher may apply for temporary re-assignment to a different school for educational purposes which includes enabling teachers in primary schools to enhance their professional experience by teaching in different types of settings and enrich their personal knowledge which can then be shared with colleagues. For example, a teacher could seek a Temporary Re-Assignment between:</p><p>-  an urban school and a rural school or vice versa</p><p>-  a large school with a single class per teacher and a smaller school with multi-grade classes</p><p>-  a junior school, that is infants to second class and a senior school where they would teach third to sixth class</p><p>-  a single gender school and a mixed gender school</p><p>-  a mainstream school and a special school</p><p>-  a DEIS school and a non-DEIS school</p><p>-  a multi-medium school and a Gaelscoil/school in a Gaeltacht area or vice versa</p><p>In accordance with the terms of the scheme, the minimum period for which a re-assignment may be facilitated is one school year and the maximum is three school years. Applications for Temporary Re-Assignment are approved by the Board of Management of each school, and details thereof are notified to my Department. On conclusion of the temporary Re-Assignment period the teacher must return to his/her original school and no further Temporary Re-Assignment can be entered into in the course of their career.  </p><p>In the first instance, the redeployment of surplus permanent and CID holding teachers is the mechanism used to fill teaching posts. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers.  Circular 0025/2022 sets out the staffing and redeployment arrangements for primary schools for the 2022/23 school year.</p></reply>

Irish, as one of the Other National Languages (ONL), is available to students in Anglophone (English-speaking) sections as an additional elective, and is taught from Nursery to Secondary 7 as a protected language in European Schools. There are clearly specified rules for access to Irish for the allocation of officially timetabled teaching time.</p>  <p>  Previous to the Board of Governors decision in 2013, different practices applied in different European Schools with regard to the teaching of Irish.  While there was flexibility in terms of providing Irish to any pupils who wished to study Irish, irrespective of the language section in which they were enrolled, there was variation in the quantity of time available. </p>  <p>  Since 2013,, Irish classes are provided, even where there is only one pupil/student wishing to take Irish in a particular year group. The regulations also allow for the combination of consecutive class groups where there are fewer than 7 in a group. From Secondary 4, Irish as an ONL is offered as an option. These arrangements give clear recognition to the special status of Irish as an Other National Language (ONL) within the European Schools&rsquo; System. </p>  <p>  Pupils and students in language sections other than the English Section do not have an automatic facility to avail of classes in Irish. Notwithstanding these Board of Governors&rsquo; regulations, local arrangements have been made at nursery and primary levels where Irish students, not enrolled in the English Sections, have been facilitated to join lessons provided for Irish pupils enrolled in the Anglophone Sections. </p>  <p>  There are particular challenges in continuing this local arrangement into the secondary cycle due to the complexities of timetabling in the secondary cycle of the ES system, the permutations relating to school size, the range of language sections and cross-section groupings for certain subjects in European Schools, and second, third and fourth mother tongue languages.  These arrangements will be kept under review.</p>  <p>  During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the ES system in 2022/23, the work already underway on the language policy for the European Schools&rsquo; system, including provision for Irish as an Other National Language (ONL) across all sectors, will be progressed as part of the ES multi-annual plan. </p></reply>

The family were advised if there was any additional relevant information that was not submitted with the original application they should make it available to the school and the school should then consult with the SENO to establish if there are grounds for reviewing the application.</p>  <p>  The SENO submitted an updated school transport application form and on consideration of this new application, the pupil was deemed eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme for children with special educational needs. Bus &Eacute;ireann who operates School Transport on behalf my Department advised there was an existing service operating that could accommodate the pupil and she began availing of this service on 25th April 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's second query I wish to advise the following. An eligible child for whom no transport service is available may, following an application and payment for transport within prescribed time limits, receive a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements. This grant is also payable for eligible children who may have to travel 3.2 kms or more to or from a designated pick up/set down point.</p>  <p>  The family referred to by the Deputy resides 7.7 km from home to their school of attendance and closest school. A transport application was received from the family on 25th February 2021 for the 2021/22 school year. As there is no school transport service in the area, the family is eligible for the Remote Area Grant for the school year 2021-22, payment of which is made during the summer months. If the family in question have any queries in this regard they should contact School Transport Section directly who will aim to assist them with their query. </p></reply>

The purpose of the lease was for the provision of part capital funding by the Minister for building and erecting a national school. Under the lease my predecessor as Minister for Education had approved funding of &pound;5,180 pounds sterling. This approximates to a value of &euro;6,579. The lease also makes reference to such further sums which the Minister may make available for additions or improvements to the said school.

Some of the factors which my Department would have regard to in considering such an application are the current and future education requirements for the area in which the property is located, and the level of capital expenditure by my Department on the school. While these are some of the factors which my Department may consider other factors may also be considered in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  As previously advised, in general the necessity for a valuation would not arise if a patron is seeking termination of a charging lease.  In this case my Department had regard to the level of capital funding previously provided to the school as there was a charge over the school based on this funding.

Brittas is located in the Blessington School Planning Area, the most recent projections indicate a decline in requirements at primary level from 2020 onwards. </p><p>The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review in the context of available information on population, enrolments and residential development activity.  Additionally, the Department will continue to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of their County Development Plans and any associated Local Area Plans with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements across these school planning areas.</p><p>In the latest published primary and post-primary schools enrolments national projections (www.gov.ie/en/collection/projections/ ), the CSO population projections (based on 2016 Census data) were used. In order to derive future schools enrolments, the new CSO population projections (based on 2022 Census results) are needed. The new population projections are not compiled yet. As soon as CSO population projections are available, the Department will update the schools&rsquo; enrolment projections model in order to reflect the recent population trends.</p><p>A number of major projects for primary and post primary schools in the Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart, Citywest and Brittas areas are at various stages of the design and build process and these projects, when completed, will cater for the demand for school places in the area, including:</p><p>Primary Schools</p><p>RN19503H  Newcastle_Rathcoole  Scoil Chronain: Project to deliver 16 classroom school + 2 SEN Base at Stage 2b</p><p>RN20531T  Newcastle_Rathcoole  Gaelscoil Lir: Project to deliver 16 Classroom school + 2 SEN Base at Stage 2b</p><p>RN20549P  Newcastle_Rathcoole  Rathcoole ETNS: Project to deliver 16 Classroom school + 2 SEN Base  at Stage 2a</p><p>Post Primary Schools</p><p>RN76594L  Newcastle_Rathcoole  Pobal Fola Saggart: Project to deliver 1,000 pupil school + 4 SEN Base at Stage 2b</p><p>RN91301D  Newcastle Rathcoole  Holy Family Comm.

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.</p>  <p>  The criteria which must be evidenced to qualify for support under the Department&rsquo;s Assistive Technology scheme are that the professional reports state in each case that the equipment is essential for the effective education of the child, illustrating how the recommended equipment is to be used for educational purposes throughout the school day. Equipment may only be provided where medical and/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Aids and Appliances Scheme.</p>  <p>  Rapid Prompt Boards are communication devices that also have a general use outside of school and as such funding is not provided for Rapid Prompt Boards under the Assistive Technology Scheme. </p>  <p>  Through its everyday work, the NCSE aligns its Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) with the Teaching Council&rsquo;s national framework for teacher professional learning. One of the main aims of the NCSE is to support teachers and schools in a way that builds capacity, supports the inclusion of all children, including students with special educational needs, at a whole school level.</p>  <p>  The NCSE provides a suite of professional learning opportunities for school leaders and teachers, which in turn, aims to improve educational experiences and outcomes for all students.</p>  <p>   The NCSE offers bespoke in-school support for either whole school staff, small groups, or individual teachers. The support can be tailored to specific TPL needs within a school, such as, in the areas of differentiation, planning, autism and behaviour. A school may contact the NCSE directly with regards to tailored training specific to their needs.</p></reply>

A further 315 special classes are already planned for 2022/23. Two new special schools opened in Cork and Dublin last September with two further special schools to open in these areas during the next school-year.</p>  <p>  In 2022, we will spend over 25% of our total educational budget on providing additional supports for children with SEN. This represents an increase of over 60%, in total expenditure, since 2011.</p>  <p>  We are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  Continuing to add capacity in schools to support SEN provision is a key priority with a particular emphasis at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information Management System (GIS) will continue to support a strategic and coordinated approach to planning and delivery of SEN provision. This includes &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; data on capacity across the school system.</p>  <p>  The Department is working actively with the NCSE and other key stakeholders including School Patrons and Management Bodies to provide additional special classes and special school places for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has actively engaged in reviewing and updating the relevant legislation at this time. Earlier this week the Government approved the text of an Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022. This legislation provides for a truncated and more streamlined Section 37A process and also places additional duties on schools to co-operate with the NCSE in relation to making additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Every support will be made available to progress additional special education capacity, in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on Dublin. The NCSE is in ongoing contact with the families of children who have not yet secured a special class or special school placement for the 2022/23 school-year. </p></reply>

The unemployment rate nationally has fallen below 5%.  In addition, the youth unemployment rate in Ireland in May 2022 was 4.9%, significantly blow the average EU unemployment rate of 13.3% at that time. </p>  <p>  This strong economic recovery coupled with the fact that many businesses across sectors are facing staff shortages currently and are actively seeking to recruit staff naturally means that the need for the Work Placement Experience Scheme has naturally been much less than anticipated. This of course is a positive development. Nevertheless WPEP remains in place for those who need it and it will be an important support to have in place should the economic situation deteriorate in the future.   </p>  <p>  The number of WPEP placements approved as of the 24th of June 2022 was 365.

The purpose of the review is to determine the extent to which the fund may be expected, in the longer term, to meet the demands in respect of payment of benefits and other payments. The review takes account of the adequacy or otherwise of contributions to support such benefits and payments as well as other matters relevant to the current and future financial condition of the fund.</p>  <p>  The most recent actuarial review, published in 2017, considered the financial position of the social insurance fund as of 31 December 2015.  The review&rsquo;s projections covered the 55-year period from 2016 to 2071.  In reaching its projections, the review includes analyses and assumptions on a range of factors including, but not confined to, real earnings growth, expenditure on short-term and long-term benefits including pensions, and inflation.   </p>  <p>  In order to quantify the scale of the fiscal sustainability challenge facing the social insurance fund in the period to 2070, updated projections, taking into account the changes that have taken place to the State pension system since 2015, are included in the Report of the Commission on Pensions which was published in October 2021.  </p>  <p>  The next actuarial review of the social insurance fund in respect of the year ending 31 December 2020 is underway. The review is expected to be completed later this year and a copy will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within six months of its completion in accordance with the statutory requirement to do so.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Remaining farm income and income from off-farm self-employment is then assessed at 70%, with 30% disregarded.  The approximate estimated annual cost, for every 1,000 recipients, of increasing the income disregard from 30% to 40% would be &euro;0.6 million; to 50% would be &euro;1.1 million; to 60% would be &euro;1.7 million; and to 70% would be &euro;2.3 million. </p>  <p>  Further to the commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, my Department recently reviewed the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist.  The report is available on the Government's website.  One of the key recommendations of the report was to provide for an extensive expansion to the list of agri-environmental schemes that qualify for a disregard which I recently introduced effective from June 2022.  </p>  <p>  In line with the provisions for Jobseeker's Allowance, a disregard of &euro;20 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;60 for up to three days, applies to off-farm earnings from employment in the means test for Farm Assist.  The cost of increasing the disregard would depend on the number of farmers in off-farm employment and the number of days worked and this information is not readily available.  The impact of this measure on a Farm Assist recipient who works 8 hours for 1 day a week at minimum wage and has means of &euro;38 deducted from their weekly payment would be as follows: the means would reduce to &euro;35 if the disregard was increased to &euro;25 per day, &euro;32 if the disregard was &euro;30 per day and &euro;26 if the disregard was &euro;40 per day. </p>  <p>  In line with other means tested social welfare schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is not assessed under Farm Assist.  The Review estimated that some 700 Farm Assist recipients would benefit from an increase in the amount disregarded in the capital assessment.  Increasing the capital disregard  to &euro;36,000 would cost between &euro;0.5 and &euro;1 million per annum.  There may also be a number of persons who do not currently qualify for a payment as their means are in excess of the maximum amount permitted as a result, inter alia, of capital held who would qualify due to the increase in the initial amount disregarded. </p>  <p>  Where capital assets, such as farm machinery or equipment, are purchased outright, an allowance for depreciation relative to their usage is made.  There would be a cost to increase the depreciation to a standard rate of 10% which would require a detailed analysis to provide an accurate costing.  This information is not readily available.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the Farm Assist scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context, within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements and with consideration to other social welfare schemes.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Customers retain a percentage of their income support payment for up to 2 years.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a case managed employment service to jobseekers, including those with disabilities, who seek support from their local Intreo Centre.  They work with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Intreo also delivers a recruitment and job matching service for employers. </p>  <p>  Employment programmes such as Community Employment and the Work Placement Experience Programme provide valuable stepping stones into sustainable employment.  My Department also contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on its behalf.  These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.</p>  <p>  Funding is also available through the Training Support Grant to help the person access private sector training providers. </p>  <p>  As part of our commitments under the Pathways to Work Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, my Department will shortly commence an early engagement approach that will see the Intreo service proactively engaging with persons with a disability at the earliest opportunity, to offer support and assistance to help them enter or return to employment.  The process will initially focus on persons aged 18 to 22 in receipt of Disability Allowance, before being expanded to other age groups and schemes.  </p>  <p>  My Department also contracts for the provision of Local Area Employment Services.  Providers deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers, including those with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the additional challenges that some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and contracts for the provision of specialist employment services (EmployAbility) to help address this.  A jobseeker with a disability who is working with their Intreo case officer (or LEAS provider) may be referred to these service providers if it is agreed that they would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services and supports for employers to recruit/retain jobseekers with a disability, including financial incentives under the Wage Subsidy Scheme and Reasonable Accommodation Fund Grants.  The Disability Awareness Support Scheme provides funding for employers to pay for disability awareness training for staff who work with a colleague with a disability.</p>  <p>  My Department has installed autism supportive sensory rooms in a number of locations.  The first room, in Limerick, arose from an Autism Initiative in 2019 by local Department staff in conjunction with local autism organisations.  The intention was to make the journey for our customers and their dependents more amenable to their place on the spectrum.  It was a bottom-up idea and reflects the culture and values of engaged and innovative staff and was driven by a committed group on the ground. </p>  <p>  As part of a rolling programme of maintenance in Intreo Centres, rooms will be provided in every Intreo Centre where this is feasible.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements and also followed up with people on responses to its appeal seeking information about burials in Bessborough. As no evidence of locations was found, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which amounts to 60 acres.  As the land is in private ownership, it is not open to the Government to procure or carry out investigations there.</p>  <p>  The Commission also examined the possibility that former residents may have been buried in other locations. It examined the surviving burial records relating to the eight burial grounds that operated in Cork City and its surrounding hinterland between 1922 and 1998 but was only able to confirm the burial locations of 63 children who were associated with Bessborough.</p>  <p>  I have engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a view to supporting local authorities, including Cork City Council, in incorporating appropriate policies on protection of burial sites into their development plans. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for relevant planning authorities, Cork City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in this instance, to make determinations regarding planned developments in the grounds of Bessborough. I have consistently highlighted that it is important to have regard to any need for further investigations by appropriate experts in relation to works commencing on a site like Bessborough.  I have also emphasised that any development should give adequate consideration to requests from survivors and their families for appropriate access and respectful memorialisation. </p>  <p>  In 2021, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the Bessborough lands, requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusions of the Commission. An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused permission to develop the area in question because it was not satisfied that the site was not previously used as a children&rsquo;s burial ground.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to raise the importance of respectful treatment of sites linked to former Mother and Baby institutions and promote engagement with relatives of the deceased, former residents and other stakeholders for that purpose.</p>  <p>  The issue of the management of burial records relating to local graveyards is a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. </p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.   </p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. </p></reply>

It will be introduced to the Seanad in the coming weeks and the remaining Seanad stages will be progressed as quickly as possible in the autumn session.

The General Scheme of the proposed Bill is published on my Department's website. The General Scheme has been referred to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting of the Bill. The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and will be brought to Government when completed.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme was also referred for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which published its report on 9 June.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has received legal advice to the effect that a transgender man who has had his gender recognised under the Gender Recognition Act 2015, and subsequently becomes pregnant, would not at present be entitled to the leave under the Acts. It is therefore proposed, by way of Head 12 of the General Scheme, to address this anomaly which has existed since the enactment of the Gender Recognition Act seven years ago.</p>  <p>  There is of course no proposal, nor any attempt, to more broadly &ldquo;erase&rdquo; women from legislation. Women, quite obviously, continue to enjoy the full suite of social supports and protections around pregnancy that is enshrined in our laws and will continue to do so. Such a characterisation insinuates a bizarre motivation on the part of the Government, when in fact the only motivation is to ensure the fair application of the law to a very small, but real, number of individuals.</p></reply>

Both Minister Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman T.D. and I had the opportunity to set out the position of Government during the debate on 29 June.</p>  <p>  Action on autism is an existing commitment in the Programme for Government, and I am leading on work to establish a national Autism Innovation Strategy. Government is committed to providing targeted and bespoke supports for neurodiverse people, which sit harmoniously in the wider context of disability policy and action. This requires a whole-of-government approach.</p>  <p>  However, it is the Government&rsquo;s view that legislation is not the most appropriate vehicle for achieving the objectives of the Bill, given the work already underway to advance national action on autism.</p>  <p>  The development of a national strategy on autism is something that my Department has already taken steps to deliver. A budgetary allocation of &euro;100,000 was secured under Budget 2022 for the purposes of designing and raising awareness of such a strategy, and on 29 April 2022, to mark Autism Awareness Month, I launched a comprehensive public consultation to inform the design of the Autism Innovation Strategy. The strategy development process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Therefore, it is critical that the Autism Innovation Strategy be co-designed and informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives. </p>  <p>  The Autism Innovation Strategy will have as its immediate focus the delivery of real and tangible solutions to the challenges, needs and experiences of people with autism and neurodiversity. It will be a flexible, agile strategy that will be capable of evolving in line with best practice and the wider policy context. The Strategy is anticipated to influence the establishment of a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for persons with autism.</p>  <p>  Given that the consultation process to inform the design of the strategy is ongoing, pre-designating specific elements or ambitions, such as data collection systems or training rollout, would not be appropriate at this time. Nevertheless, I anticipate that actions on data collection and training will be included within it. </p>  <p>  A draft Autism Innovation Strategy will be published as soon as possible following consideration of all consultation responses. This will be followed by a second consultation after which the final Autism Innovation Strategy will be presented to Government for adoption.</p></reply>

In this regard, consideration is also being given to alternative forms of provision which could facilitate continued remote engagement with Ukrainian institutions. This may involve access to libraries and ICT facilities and other supports identified as the situation evolves.

The programme is delivered in two settings, Youthreach centres and Community Training Centres (CTCs).  The ESRI&rsquo;s Evaluation of the National Youthreach Programmes in 2019 found that the Youthreach programmes had significant value in re-engaging a vulnerable group of young people with learning, providing courses and a multiplicity of approaches tailored to their individual needs and embedding education and training provision within a broader network of supports.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the Youthreach programme in both settings is subject to Operator Guidelines in the case of Youthreach centres dating from 2015 and to Operating Standards for the CTCs dating from 2013.</p>  <p>  The primary target group for Youthreach Centres is young people between 16 and 20 years of age. Those aged 15 years of age may, as an exceptional measure, be admitted to the Youthreach centres where they have left school with no possibility of return.  This age group are not admissible to CTCs, who were set up by local community organisations to cater primarily for early school leavers between 16 and 21 years. Youthreach participants aged 16 and 17 in either setting receive an age-related training allowance, currently &euro;45 per week.  Learners over 18 years of age entering CTCs must undergo a Department of Social Protection (DSP) means test before they can qualify and receive their training allowance.   However, learners in Youthreach centres are paid the training allowance once they are not in receipt of a DSP payment. When a learner starts on a Youthreach programme, The DSP are immediately informed to ensure no double payment takes place. This difference is historical in nature.</p>  <p>  In its response to the ESRI Evaluation, SOLAS made a series of recommendations which included that ETBs should work together to develop and adopt a uniform approach to programme referral and entry into Youthreach based on existing good practice. SOLAS also proposed that the role of Youthreach programme guidelines be reviewed, given the central role of ETB planning and funding parameters in setting requirements from FET provision, and a cross-FET guidebook on programme practice should be developed to ensure clarity around programme expectations leading to clear pathways of progression opportunities for learners. </p>  <p>  A key priority of Future FET: Transforming Learning, the national Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is to ensure consistency of support for all learners. SOLAS is pursuing the implementation of its recommendations through the National FET Strategy and as part of the Strategic Performance Agreement process in conjunction with individual Education and Training Boards.</p>  <p>  An Operational Guidelines Working Group (OGWG) has been established by ETBI  to review the operational guidelines applying to CTCs, and Specialist Training Provision as well as Local Training Initiatives within the FET Sector.  The Group, comprising of FET Staff from a number of ETBs will review the Guidelines and revise/update as required. They will look at areas such as deficiencies, common areas, good practices, siloed practices/outdated practices and ensure the learner is represented in delivering high quality ETB programmes to meet the needs of that learner.  The OGWG is due to report to the ETB FET Directors later in 2022 and I expect that it will address the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Additionally under the 2013 Regulations, persons undertaking on-site security work and persons or classes of persons as may be prescribed by the relevant Minister are required to hold a safety awareness registration card (Safe Pass card). </p>  <p>  The Construction Skills Certificate Scheme and Quarrying Skills Certificate Scheme went through a detailed review and following consultation with public sector bodies (Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Health and Safety Authority) industry (Construction Industry Federation, Concrete Federation of Ireland, Electrical Contractors etc) and staff representatives (SIPTU, Building &amp;amp; Allied Trades' Union, Technical Engineering &amp;amp; Electrical Union, etc).  All stakeholders agreed that the recommendations of the review would be adopted including moving to a licence system (similar to the EU) with an assessment event every 5 years and a move away from the Certificate approach.</p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Construction Skills Certification Scheme and Quarrying Skills Certification Schemes is to ensure that people competently operate machinery and conduct tasks in a safe and competent manner. This requires appropriate monitoring and inspection. The current certification arrangements through QQI do not include such monitoring and inspection. </p>  <p>  In recognition of this, and supported by research undertaken by SOLAS and outlined in the Bearing Point report, the current certification (QQI) approach will transition to a licencing model for both programmes.

Over the past two years, we have allocated &euro;10 million to higher education institutions to assist with supports for students. Each college was asked to focus on the recruitment of additional staff and address waiting lists. My Department allocates funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to the HEIs. As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of their student services, the employment of counselling staff, and the procurement of counselling, waiting lists and mental health services are a matter for the individual institutions. </p>  <p>  However, I have asked the HEA to provide me with further detail on the allocation of that funding and its impact on waiting lists and I can revert to the Deputy. I am advised the funding over the past two years has enabled support services in HEIs to use new platforms and contemporary communication channels to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to contact their student mental health services. This reaching out assisted in the support of students while COVID restriction were in place and continues to do so. </p>  <p>  In 2020 PCHEI, Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education in Ireland, received funding to establish a national office that would, among other objectives, support the development of Student Counselling Services so they best meet the needs of students both now and into the future. In 2021 a consortium consisting of TUS, DkIT and PCHEI received funding for the project, &lsquo;PCHEI Data set &ndash; Evidence base on counselling engagements, referrals and supports.&rsquo; The completion of this project will facilitate the gathering of data regarding the number of students engaged in counselling and with supports in HEIs on a national basis.</p>  <p>  In the Further Education and Training (FET) area, learners may have access to internal psychological supports from qualified ETB staff. Funding for these supports are dispersed under general individual programme and learner support headings. SOLAS allocates funding for Guidance, Counselling and Psychological Services for Youthreach participants.</p></reply>

Funding for approved programmes or courses will be rolled out over 3 years, starting in 2023.</p><p>The proposals will form part of the National Plan for Equity of Access, Participation and Success in Higher Education.</p><p>An open consultation process informed the development of this plan, and a wide range of stakeholders including those representing students with Disabilities and Autism made submissions. </p><p>As part of continuing research to support phase 2 of PATH 4 additional engagement with both the learner &amp;amp; their parents will be required. Officials in my Department plan to engage expertise to support my Department and HEA to support the management of a structured engagement process to design an appropriate call for proposals for students with an intellectual disability in ways that facilitate appropriate evaluation. </p><p><b>About PATH</b></p><p>The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund supports innovative approaches to delivering the ambitions, goals and objectives of National Access Plans.</p><p>This new measure will support the creation of greater capacity within higher education for embedding inclusive practices using universal design practices which will help all students, including students with autism and other additional needs.</p><p>A whole of institution approach to student success for all and the embedding of universal design and inclusive practices will be a key feature in the new plan benefiting all students, while being of particular benefit to students with disabilities including students with autism and students with an intellectual disability.</p><p>Inclusion is one of the core strategic goals for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. A key ambition for the department is to ensure that we provide more opportunities in higher education for all reflecting the diversity of our population.</p><p>This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, people who are most marginalised and people with special and additional needs. This means assisting people in accessing and progressing through further education and training and higher education.</p><p>This important development will help to build on the existing but limited provision already available in Higher Education Institutions for students with intellectual disabilities. These measures to be put in place under a new PATH Strand 4: Universal Design for All and improving opportunities for Students with Intellectual Disabilities to engage in Higher Education.</p><p>PATH 4 aims to:</p><p>Support a more diverse student body in Higher Education that includes students with an intellectual disability</p><p>Support capacity building and embed universal design approaches for all, particularly students with autism and an intellectual disability in higher education</p><p>Develop policies and subsequent implementation plans to promote participation of students with intellectual disabilities in higher education</p><p>Advance a holistic student-centred partnership approach within the tertiary education sector which will enable students with an intellectual disability reach their potential</p><p>Phase 1</p><p>Phase 1 will be a once off fund of &euro;3 million for universal design which will be allocated to higher education institutions in 2022 to advance universal design and inclusive practices in higher education. This measure will complement existing student success measures in higher education for all students and learners. While benefiting all students, it will be of particular benefit students with disabilities, including students with autism. It will also enable the development of future capacity in HEIs for creating more opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Phase 2</p><p>Phase 2 will be a competitive funding call for new 3-year pathfinding pilot programmes/course provision for students with intellectual disabilities with a funding stream of &euro;3 million a year over 3 years, commencing in 2023. The outcomes arising from this investment will inform future policy beyond the pathfinding pilot phase which will take place over a period between 2022 and 2025.</p><p>One of my priorities is to support learning for all. I want the tertiary education system to develop and grow its supports for vulnerable learners, autistic students, learners with disabilities, under-represented groups and the most marginalised. I want learners to engage with and complete their education journey while recognising that some learners will need additional supports to help them achieve their full potential.</p><p>My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review; to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, how we can support different providers in working together and learning from each other, and examining what is scalable from institutional-level approaches. </p></reply>

To address this and further alleviate the pressures arising from the rise in costs for students and their families I initiated improvements for the academic year 2022/23 by increasing all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, by &euro;200 per year as well as increasing the qualifying income thresholds (except special rate) by &euro;1,000. I have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant. These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on the improvements that have already been made through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.  </p>  <p>  I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future Budgets. I want this done in a way which does not negatively impact on the sustainable core funding for higher education. Higher Education Institutions currently receive c.&euro;434m from student contributions. That breaks down as &euro;248m from students and circa &euro;186m from the Exchequer through SUSI. In addition the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.</p>  <p>  In advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  The total allocation for the Fund in the 2021/22 academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro; 18.5 million.</p></reply>

The balance of minor applications in the system are made up of applications based on Irish Association (226), applications in respect of minors born in the State but not entitled to citizenship at the time of their birth (827) and applications for Declarations under Section 28 and 28A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act (71). Almost half of these applications have been in the system 12 months or fewer. </p><p>For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p><p>In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p><p>Regrettably, the current average processing time for naturalisation applications for minors is approximately 26 months. This average processing time is based on the time from receipt of an application to the date of issuing a decision and reflects the efforts made to clear the oldest applications on hand. As the oldest applications are cleared this average will decrease. </p><p>In the first six months of this year, 1,005 minor applications have been issued with a decision on their application. Over the last two months, the Citizenship Division of my Department has been specifically focusing on the processing of naturalisation applications for minors, which has resulted in over 1,100 applicants having been contacted directly regarding the further processing of their applications.</p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. </p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  </p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p><p>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an application may be submitted for a minor if the minor's parents have already been naturalised or if the minor is of Irish descent or has Irish associations or, at the time of their birth, was not entitled to Irish citizenship but has since accumulated five years reckonable residency in the State.</p><p>It is my intention that the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will reduce the residency requirements for naturalisation for children born in the State from five years to three years and will also set out clear procedures that will apply to citizenship applications relating to children.</p><p>Detailed information on Irish citizenship and the naturalisation process, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on my Department's immigration website at: irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/.</p><p>My Department successfully hosted the first in-person citizenship ceremony since the pandemic on 20 June 2022, with further ceremonies now planned for December 2022, in Killarney.</p><p>The number of minor applications pending is set out in the below table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Time since application received</th>       <th>Number of applications</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Under 12 months</td>       <td>2,164 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 - 2 years</td>       <td>1,246 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 &ndash; 3 years</td>       <td>776 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Over 3 years</td>       <td>464 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>4,650 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy, 'Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025'. This strategy represents a whole-of-government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Drug-related intimidation is a very serious issue and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) previously worked with the National Family Support Network to develop &lsquo;the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&rsquo; to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug-related intimidation, which met the obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under action 4.1.42 of the national drugs and alcohol strategy. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Garda authorities that the Commissioner tasked an Inspector in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation. There are currently thirty nominated Garda Inspectors appointed to act as liaison officers for the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, covering each Garda Division.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme annual conferences, which are coordinated via the National Drug Strategy Project Office at the GNDOCB, plays a very important role in creating awareness of the programme among Garda members and the general public via the nominated Inspectors and Local / Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Force representatives in attendance. The next conference is scheduled to take place during August 2022.</p>  <p>  People seeking assistance may contact their local Inspector confidentially who will provide practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation. Information in relation to the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide, including their contact details, is available on the Garda Website, garda.ie.  Furthermore, people may seek assistance or report a crime by contacting the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666111 or Crimestoppers on 1800 250025.

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection from the State can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p><p>In total, there were 9,048 international protection applications on hand at the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department at the end of June 2022.</p><p>The table below sets out the figures requested by the Deputy. <table>    <tr>       <th>Less than 6 months</th>       <th>6,209 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Between 6 and 12 months</td>       <td>1,308 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Between 12 and 24 months</td>       <td>605 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Between 24 and 60 months</td>       <td>813 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that in recent months, the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly, with 6,498 applications made so far this year to the end of June 2022. This is a 191% increase on the same period in 2019, the last year in which application numbers were not impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to work to improve the international protection process and to reduce processing times, in line with the recommendations made by the Expert Advisory Group, led by Dr. Catherine Day, and the commitments in the Government's White Paper, published by my colleague, Minister Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman. </p><p>However, the substantially higher number of applications currently being received, as outlined, will present a significant challenge in achieving this.</p><p>The restrictions on international travel for much of the last two years will naturally have created a higher demand for protection now that travel opportunities have resumed. Similar increases in application numbers are being experienced across our fellow EU Member States. The war in Ukraine is also having an impact. Some Member States are currently hosting hundreds of thousands or even millions of people displaced from Ukraine, leaving them with reduced capacity to support asylum seekers from other countries. </p><p>My Department is taking all possible steps to ensure we can process applications as quickly as possible. An end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from my Department has been completed and published. New measures and procedures will continue to be put in place to improve efficiencies across all aspects of the protection process. </p><p>Since the introduction of new efficiency measures, in the first five months of this year we have been able to increase the number of first instance recommendations and permission to remain decisions being made by the IPO by almost 50%, when compared with the same period pre-Covid in 2019. We will continue to look further at how we increase the processing capacity of the IPO to match the very significant number of international protection applications being received, including through the recruitment of an external panel of barristers, solicitors and legal graduates, which is underway. </p><p>My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times.</p></reply>

Many people comply with this and leave the country, without notifying the immigration authorities that they have done so. </p>  <p>  There are currently 3,692 people in the section 3 process under the Immigration Act 1999, subject to a notification of intention to deport. This figure includes people who have applied to have their deportation order revoked.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau adopted a very humane approach to the enforcement of deportation orders during the pandemic. During this time, no orders were enforced except in cases where an individual would be considered a threat to national security or whose presence in Ireland would be contrary to the public interest.</p>  <p>  With the lifting of public health restrictions and a return to more normal travel, it must be acknowledged that those who do not have a legal right to remain in this country must return to their own country, following fair procedure and having gone through all available avenues for appeal. Many people already do this voluntarily and are assisted by the Department and other organisations, such as the International Organization for Migration, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  However where a person does not voluntarily return to their own country, Ireland like all other EU Member States, puts in place arrangements to return persons to their home country.

It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.</p>  <p>  This follows on from the work I have been doing to implement 'Supporting a Victim's Journey', our plan to give effect to all of the recommendations of the O'Malley Review. </p>  <p>  I know from engagement with victims and victims groups, that the issue raised by the Deputy has the potential to cause distress and can lead to feelings of re-victimisation. There are a number of actions in Supporting a Victim's Journey designed to lessen such a possibility. </p>  <p>  One is the need for every professional person involved in a sexual offence case to have proper specialist training in this area. This action will cover the Garda&iacute;, the lawyers for the prosecution and the defence, as well as the judges in these cases. </p>  <p>  Also, the right to separate legal representation for victims - when an application is made to question them about sensitive areas such as their sexual experience - will be extended to include trials for sexual assault. Previous to this, victims only had this right in trials for the more serious offence of rape. </p>  <p>  Defence lawyers' ability to cross-examine victims about their sexual history and experience, or what clothing they were wearing, is potentially a re-traumatising event. It may also be a contributing factor why rape and other sexual offences are underreported. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the legislation I recently introduced, which provides for preliminary trial hearings, will have a significant positive impact in this area. Preliminary trial hearings will be used to examine defence applications to question a victim on such matters and if this is to happen, the legal aid board will be notified accordingly. Other issues - such as the use of an intermediary and any other special measures required - can also be addressed at the preliminary trial hearing.</p>  <p>  The implementation of both Supporting a Victims Journey and the Third National DSGBV strategy will create a more supportive criminal justice system where every victim of a sexual offence feels that they can come forward confident in the knowledge that they will be supported throughout the entire process, treated fairly and have their dignity respected at all stages.</p></reply>

The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  As a start, the Strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we will have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes and step down accommodation as a key part of this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Service, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Based on analysis at the time, it found a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority.  Further analysis and the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.</p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively.</p>  <p>  The initial areas identified in the Tusla review include Cavan/Monaghan, where eight family places are suggested as a starting point for prioritisation.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to both improve how, and how quickly, we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  The Strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the Strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Any application under Section 16 that relies on Irish associations and affinity should be supported by substantive documentation supporting the claim, documentation that renders the application exceptional and one where the normal pathways to citizenship provided for under the legislation are not appropriate.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p>  <p>  However, an association going back two generations without any other link to the State is generally not considered as sufficient to warrant consideration of the waiving of the statutory residence conditions.</p>  <p>  Applicants who seek to avail of the discretion provided under Section 16 of the Act are expected to have a reasonable period of lawful residence in the State, generally around three years, to show they have some substantial and tangible connection with Irish society and the State. An Irish association through a great-grandparent, (or a grandparent where that grandparent obtained citizenship through naturalisation) and where there is no, or negligible, reckonable residency would generally be deemed insufficient to warrant the exercise of discretion, and would result in a refusal.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on the following website. www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/</p>  <p>  Additionally, persons born outside of Ireland who have an Irish national grandparent born in Ireland may obtain Irish citizenship through registration in the Foreign Births Register, which is maintained by Department of Foreign Affairs.

The Strategy aims to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to promote equality, embrace diversity and foster inclusion, not only in our daily interactions and activities as colleagues, but also in the design &amp;amp; delivery of the services that we provide to the public.</p>  <p>  Overall, the EDI Strategy prioritises three areas of focus for strategic impact:</p>  <p>  - achieve better policy outcomes and improve the accessibility and quality of our services;</p>  <p>  - support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce which is reflective of the diversity within our population / country; and</p>  <p>  - build and embed a workplace culture which facilitates, supports and encourages contributions from all.</p>  <p>  Each of these strategic outcomes are underpinned by a number of actions which my Department will implement over the lifetime of the EDI Strategy.</p>  <p>  Improving the accessibility and quality of our services requires consideration of the varied requirements of our stakeholders including the importance of respecting neurodiversity and ensuring that my officials are suitably trained and equipped to provide an appropriate service to autistic people.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department has an Access Officer, appointed in accordance with Section 26(2) of the Disability Act. The Access Officer is responsible for providing, arranging or co-ordinating assistance to persons with disabilities who wish to access the services provided by my Department. The Access Officer also acts as a point of contact for persons with disabilities, including autistic people, who may wish to access such services</p>  <p>  As part of building knowledge and awareness my Department held an information session for staff in April 2022 to mark Autism Awareness Month, which focused on neurodiversity in the workplace and supporting staff to understand the needs of neuro-diverse colleagues.</p>  <p>  My Department also aims to roll out an e-learning module on the Just A Minute (JAM) Card for all staff this year. As the Deputy may be aware, the JAM Card allows people with specific communication requirements or barriers which might not be immediately apparent, such as Autism, to tell others that they need extra time and understanding in a discreet and easy way.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with NOW Group to ensure this e-learning module is fully accessible with a screen reader. Once fully accessible, this JAM Card module will be made available to all staff across my Department. My Department will also make a module on disability equality awareness available to all staff when it is completed and launched by the National Disability Authority.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the need to be respectful in the area of neurodiversity and have developed specific training on autism awareness in order to ensure Garda&iacute; are appropriately trained to interact with and support autistic people.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to use its governance engagement with agencies under its remit to promote awareness of accessibility issues and of the obligations arising for agencies under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.1555.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500082#WRBB05300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 550 and 558 together.</p><p>The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>Given the global nature of the drugs trade, international law enforcement co-operation remains a key element in the overall response. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL and Europol and participating in the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N) based in Lisbon.</p><p>In this regard, I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in harnessing an international coalition of support to tackle the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is also having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The success is evident by the nationwide results of Operation Tara, which has a focus to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle drug related harms.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, including drug rehabilitation programmes, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. While implementation of the strategy is led by the Department of Health, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. In addition, we will continue to roll out the Greentown initiative which is designed to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.  <b></b></p><p>I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.</p></reply>

If an individual fails to comply with any bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant and this gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail.</p><p>While I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the State's amended bail laws have proven to be effective, all legislative provisions are kept under review in light of the existing provisions and safeguards relating to the granting of bail. However, I can inform the Deputy there are no immediate plans to introduce further bail legislation at this time, but I will keep the law under active review.</p><p>The table below shows the number of crime incidents reported in the specified year, the number of those incidents where the incident record indicated at least one of the persons associated with the incident as a &lsquo;Suspected Offender&rsquo; were flagged as having being suspected of committing the offence while on bail. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Total Incidents</th>       <th>Incidents Committed while on Bail</th>       <th>Percentage </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>305,926 </td>       <td>27,147 </td>       <td>9% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>317,412 </td>       <td>30,575 </td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>315,101 </td>       <td>28,682 </td>       <td>9% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>317,871 </td>       <td>34,010 </td>       <td>11% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>281,290 </td>       <td>34,738 </td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>285,307 </td>       <td>30,932 </td>       <td>11% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022* </td>       <td>128,062 </td>       <td>13,039 </td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr> </table> * Incidents reported up to and including 30-Jun-2022.

It is a wide-ranging piece of legislation which significantly enhances laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  Specific offences have been provided for in this Act to target the recognised steps in what is often a gradual process of grooming a victim.</p>  <p>  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act are measures to strengthen significantly the existing criminal law in combating child exploitation and, in particular, to address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that sophisticated grooming often involves seemingly innocent contact with, or befriending of, a child, perhaps through text messaging, social media or messaging apps. This may be followed by the exposure of the child to sexual images or content.  Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a specific offence of using information and communications technology to communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  The offence allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to justice online predators and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.  This is in recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity so as to facilitate the production of pornography or to meet the child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that child trafficking and exploitation (including the production of child pornography) are criminalised under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 to raise the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 years from 5 to 7 years imprisonment.  Furthermore, the 2017 Act amended the 2006 Act to raise the maximum penalty for attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years from 2 to 7 years imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, as amended, also provides that the maximum penalty for engaging in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years is life imprisonment and the same penalty applies to attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15 years.</p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (known as the "Lanzarote Convention") on 21 December 2020. The Convention entered into force in relation to Ireland on 1 April 2021.</p>  <p>  Part 2 of The Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 which strengthens the law relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, and criminalises the use of information and communication technology to facilitate such exploitation, ensures the State&rsquo;s full compliance with criminal law provisions in the Convention.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2019 introduces, inter alia, stricter penalties for repeat sexual offenders. The Act provides that where an offender is convicted of a sexual offence listed in a new schedule to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 (including a number of sexual offences against children) and is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of at least 5 years and is subsequently &ndash; within a period of 10 years &ndash; convicted of a further scheduled offence, the court shall, when imposing sentence for that offence, specify a term of imprisonment to be served by the person, that is no less than three quarters of the maximum penalty for the offence.</p>  <p>  Where the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the court shall impose a sentence of not less than 10 years imprisonment. However, the court has discretion not to apply the minimum sentence if it is satisfied that this would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.</p>  <p>  While there are currently no new legislative measures being advanced specifically in relation to child sexual abuse, I am bringing forward the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill which will  strengthen the management of convicted sex offenders on release. I am of course committed to ensuring the law in this area is comprehensive and effective. As such, it is constantly kept under review and if further changes are identified as being needed, these will be brought forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s new proposal, published in May this year, on tackling child sexual abuse online.  This draft Regulation sets out comprehensive new requirements on online companies to assess and mitigate the extent to which their platforms are being misused for the purposes of child sexual abuse, both in terms of hosting material and the exploitation by abusers of their services for the purposes of grooming children.  The Regulation will introduce provisions requiring companies to detect and report such material.  It will also create a new EU Centre to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies across the Union in tackling online child sexual abuse.  I expressed my strong support for this new proposal to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, at the recent WeProtect Global Alliance summit on child sexual abuse in Brussels.</p></reply>

Any person, during the five years reckonable residence required for naturalisation, may have been able to seek employment having been granted an immigration permission from my Department that permits employment, or upon being granted an employment permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  My Justice Plan 2022 commits to developing a fully digital, customer-centric immigration service and to enhance the efficiency of our immigration system. In line with these commitments, a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact on immigration processing times, including the introduction of online applications, a new customer service helpdesk and a new customer-focused immigration website. </p>  <p>  As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the additional staff assigned to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were delivered. This is the highest number of decisions since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.  For the first six months of 2022, almost 7,900 citizenship decisions have been issued.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is also freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. </p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p></reply>

To the greatest extent possible, these measures include the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. </p>  <p>  The additional resources allocated to AGS in recent years have enabled the Garda Commissioner to assign extra resources to the specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Armed Support Unit, Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses multi-disciplinary approaches to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. Such approaches also include the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to CAB under the proceeds of crime legislation. Other measures taken to tackle organised crime include the strengthening of legislation where required, the establishment of a second Special Criminal Court in 2016, and the establishment of Garda Armed Response Units in all Garda regions which are available to support all divisions countrywide.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in harnessing an international coalition of support to tackle the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The enforcement of sanctions demonstrates the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime and the actions taken recently send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang, that criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.   </p>  <p>  Given the fluid nature of such criminal groupings it is extremely difficult to quantify the number of criminal gangs operating at a particular time. Splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. Organised Crime is constantly evolving and new innovations in crime are continuously emerging.</p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.</p></reply>

There is no application process and the Service does not collect data on the number of first time offenders who availed of these services.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2019 - 2022 commits to further develop the integration of prisoner care and support services to deliver more effective rehabilitation to prisoners. It aims to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management to maximise the potential engagement of prisoners in constructive and structured activities during their time in custody. The  Service actively encourages all prisoners to participate in constructive and rehabilitative opportunities available by providing rewards under an Incentivised Regimes Policy.</p>  <p>  The Joint Irish Prison Service/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 &ndash; 2022 commits to the provision of broad based education. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents.  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  </p>  <p>  As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, curriculum development that is specific to prison circumstances has taken place, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. Other areas where there have been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts, in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education on the outside.  </p>  <p>  The prisons' Work and Training service make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody. Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning and industrial skills.  </p>  <p>  The "Working to Change Social Enterprise and Employment Strategy - 2021-2023" sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and Probation Service and my Department.</p>  <p>  The Prison Psychology Service provide assessment and intervention for all individuals in custody and operates a &lsquo;proactive&rsquo; referral service for particular cohorts of people in custody. The Psychology Service proactively engages with the following groups of people</p>  <p>  - 18 &ndash; 24 year olds who are committed to custody with a sentence of one year or more, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p>  <p>  - People committed to custody with a sentence of two years or more for a violent offence, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p>  <p>  - People convicted of sexual violence;</p>  <p>  - People sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The Probation Service have joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have post release supervision orders. This multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation is in place in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes. </p>  <p>  Since 2020, due to the pandemic, every effort is made to ensure the delivery of services continued in so far as possible, with course materials and books delivered to people in cells if, for example, they were in quarantine.  A  TV Information Channel was also developed and a Covid Communications Group consisting of Red Cross, Healthcare, Psychology, Education, Chaplains, Resettlement member produced regular Prisoner Newsletters (also translated into the main languages) which were delivered to people in custody, to ensure they were kept up-to-date with information and any changes regarding rehabilitation, including educational and library services.</p></reply>

This is having an impact on delivering routine, non-priority developmental screening assessments. This means that the service can no longer carry out Developmental Assessments for 3 month, 9-11months, 21-24 months and 46-48 months in vacant PHN caseloads.</p>  <p>  The Dublin West team have implemented a system which enables them to prioritise the screening services and address those needs while the staffing issue is being addressed. There are a number of reasons for the staff shortages:</p>  <p>  The Public Health Nursing Sponsorship Programme is currently the only route for recruitment into Public Health Nursing. The PHN Department supports the sponsorship of approx. 6- 8 standard PHNs annually however as per the National PHN Transfer Agreement (2015) PHNs who train apply for a transfer post their 18 months sponsorship. </p>  <p>  Since 2015 40 PHNs have transferred. Despite 3 recent cRGN recruitment campaigns the service has been unsuccessful in attracting candidates to the area. Staff retirement and staff moving to take up promotional opportunities have also reduced the number of PHNs in the area.</p>  <p>  From 2021 to 2022, 5 PHNs transferred and 5 PHNs commenced working as ADPHNs. This year the PHN Department has applied for standard PHNs and every effort is being made to recruit nurses.  There are 4 PHNs due to qualify in 2022 and these will be assigned to fill vacant PHN areas.</p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that they will continue to use transfer panels and recruit for Public Health Nurses across the area. The situation is expected to improve in coming months when student PHNs are allocated to the area.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Minister secured annual investment of &euro;195m to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme.   This investment is supporting a programmatic and integrated approach to the development of the primary and community care sector.  The ECC programme represents a significant expansion in primary care capacity, and will see some 3,500 additional staff recruited overall, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html  . Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

This is a public body established in law to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and the public by regulating both pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland. To qualify as a Pharmacist in Ireland, a student must complete the PSI-accredited Five-Year Integrated Pharmacy Programme (M.Pharm). This is a master&rsquo;s level qualification and on successful completion of the programme, graduates are then eligible to apply to the PSI for registration.</p>  <p>  Placements for the five-year programme are managed by APPEL (Affiliation for Pharmacy Practice Experiential Learning), which was established by the three Schools of Pharmacy in Ireland to manage and centralise the learning placements for students from each of the schools. APPEL also offers placement providers a single point of contact, training and support. The structure of the placements may be viewed at:  </p>  <p>  www.thepsi.ie/Libraries/Education/Placement_Structure_for_5Yr_Prog_Final_Post_ISG_Mtg_071014.sflb.ashx . </p>  <p>  The MPharm Programme involves the integration and dispersal of practice placements for students throughout the five years. This includes experiential placements of varying durations in the three main areas of pharmacy practice, i.e., community, hospital and industry during second, fourth and fifth year with placements in industry and other practice areas (health service, regulatory etc.) occurring in the fourth year.  </p>  <p>  The MPharm Programme offers opportunities for students to be placed in the three main areas of pharmacy practice and is structured as such to benefit both the student learning experience and contribute to improved outcomes in the health system; the placement in the final year however is required to be in a patient facing role. The majority of students currently complete their final placements in a community pharmacy setting where the placement provider covers direct costs on an altruistic basis, and the latter is not supported by subvention to do so.    </p>  <p>  Given the particularities of the current structure by which experiential learning placements are delivered during the course of training to become a pharmacist, it is not currently possible to state the cost of a 10% increase in placements if the number of undergraduate new entrants in pharmacy increased by 10%.</p></reply>

This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme. In terms of scope, the National Review covers scheduled and unscheduled hospital-based services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease in adults. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted on the progress of the review during 2020 and into 2021 as the Chair of the Cardiac Services Review has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response.  </p>  <p>  Currently the Steering Group is working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft report.  The Steering Group most recently met on the 26th of May 2022 to further progress the review and planning for the next meeting in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  To facilitate increased patient involvement during the HTA process, the NCPE promotes a patient submission which provides an opportunity for the views and experience of patients, carers and their families to be considered as part of the assessment of a particular medicine. The NCPE provides the full patient submission to the CPU as part of the documentation for consideration by the HSE Drugs Group. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC) was introduced by HSE Leadership (as recommended by the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland) with responsibility for:  </p>  <p>  1. Reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and</p>  <p>  2. Providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable. </p>  <p>  The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for reimbursement of OMPs are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal or reimbursement process, but to complement it.</p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee also facilitates the input of patient and clinician perspectives to assist the Drugs Group in its reimbursement recommendations to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT). </p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT. </p>  <p>  The HSE EMT is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether a given medicine will be approved for reimbursement. The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-05a.1809.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070500087#WRGG01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 635, 636 and 639 together.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government agreed in 2020 commits the government to &lsquo;Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Consequently, work is on-going within the Department of Health to progress the development of the new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis by the Department to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks has commenced. </p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. A 6-week public consultation was launched on June 16th in association with the Institute of Public Health (IPA) who will assist with survey testing, data analysis and reporting. A report on the findings of the public consultation will be prepared by the IPA for the Department of Health.  Evaluating the survey feedback and the IPA report on the consultation will inform amendments in the draft regulations.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. As part of this a home support pilot using interRAI assessments is underway in 4 pilot areas (East Westmeath in Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 8; Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea in CHO 2; Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline in CHO 4; and Ballyfermot and Palmerstown in CHO 7). InterRAI assessments will assist in the delivery of a standardised approach to care planning and supports the objective of maintaining clients in the community.</p>  <p>  On June 28th the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, Mary Butler announced the recruitment of 128 interRAI care needs facilitators with a view to having the posts in place by the end of Q3 2022. This will help to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new statutory home-support scheme. </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: </p><p>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE and will be completed as soon as possible. As of Friday, 1st July, approximately than 75,815 eligible HSE and Section 38 staff have received payment around the country. All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment. As eligibility is still being assessed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with an estimated number of public service workers who are eligible to receive the payment.  </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p><p>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers highlighted above has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers who will receive the payment. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible. </p></reply>

There were a lot of valuable lessons learned as the health system deployed the IHI at scale, including the importance of recording mobile numbers, email address and EIRCODE as part of the supporting IHI dataset and the significance of PPSNs as a means for people to readily identify their corresponding IHI number. Indeed the upcoming Health Information Bill will promote the PPSN as the primary identifier for citizens using the health service with the IHI embedded within the healthcare records themselves, as recommended by HIQA. Experience from the pandemic, and the national vaccination programme, has proven that the PPSN (along with name and date of birth) is the simplest way for health service providers to allocate an IHI to a clinical record. PPSNs and photo identification were used to identify users of the national vaccination programme.  It provided a robust mechanism of allocating Individual Health Identifiers and subsequently issuing Digital COVID-19 Certificates (DCCs), to all those who received a vaccination. As a process, this is a potential basis for further deployments to GP systems, hospital Patient Appointment Systems (PAS) and the national maternity system in 2022.</p>  <p>  Deployment of eHealth solutions and the joining up of health records from across the health system also requires the deployment of individual health identifiers (IHI). </p></reply>

This will enable the facility to open as a digital hospital and represent a significant step forward in the journey towards achieving digitised patient record systems and enabling greater sharing of such records between care providers that are based in different healthcare settings. The implementation of an EHR at CHI follows previous deployment of EHR system in Ireland and builds on the success of the electronic health record programmes at the country&rsquo;s largest maternity hospitals and at St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. </p>  <p>  Since 2022, contracts are also in place for the delivery of clinical management systems capable of delivering electronic health records for patients at the new National Rehabilitation and National Forensics Hospitals. </p>  <p>  Also in 2022, market soundings were completed for a suitable patient management systems across the community healthcare setting and a public spending code compliant business case will be developed to secure sanction for investment in this important area. </p>  <p>  The Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), which generates electronic health records for newborn babies and their mothers, is now well established. It has now been implemented in CUH, University Hospital Kerry, The Rotunda Hospital and National Maternity Hospital, resulting in more than 40% of babies born in Ireland having an EHR created at birth. Approval has been provided for deployment to the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital and the maternity hospital at University Hospital Limerick and these sites are scheduled to go live in 2022 and 2023. This will result in 70% of babies born in Ireland having electronic health records at birth. An approach to the wider deployment of EHRs at national, regional and local level will also be considered in the context of a refreshed eHealth Digital healthcare strategy, due later this year.</p>  <p>  The National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) captures images digitally for all major modalities at all major acute healthcare settings, which facilitates sharing of these images regardless of where a patient if being treated.</p>  <p>  Combined with widespread adoption of practice management systems at GP surgeries and community pharmacy systems, where patient medical information is stored in digital format, and the national digital messaging systems 'Healthlink' for sharing of clinical information, Ireland is certainly in a better position that it was just a few years ago. Nonetheless, sustained investment and focus is required to get to where we need to be, whereby digital records become the norm across the Irish health system, and where systems can share the information more easily so that healthcare professionals can access and update the information they need for the patient they are treating, safely and securely. Based on experience from other countries that have more digitally mature health systems, we expect that will require an ongoing commitment in terms of funding and resources in the short, medium and long term.</p></reply>

Under the updated framework children and young people assessed as Grade 4 - whose care that can be appropriately dealt in a community practice setting, and who have been waiting over 4 years are offered treatment. To date over 742 patients have accepted transfer and are currently in treatment.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also developing service improvement initiatives to ensure that all referrals will receive an orthodontic assessment within 6 months and that the number of inappropriate referrals will be reduced.</p>  <p>  Access to orthodontic treatment in another EU jurisdiction is also available under the EU Cross Border Healthcare Directive for patients that are already on an orthodontic treatment waiting list.  Many patients in border areas have accessed care in Northern Ireland through this route pre-Brexit.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The process and procedure for determining financial assessment of means is prescribed in the existing legislation. </p>  <p>  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence. However, this three-year cap is not applied to other assets, unless they are farm or business assets to which a family successor has been appointed.  </p>  <p>  Remaining non-cash assets, including a second house, land or additional properties, are assessed at 7.5% of their value per annum (3.75% if the person applying is part of a couple). The first &euro;36,000 (&euro;72,000 if part of a couple) of assets is excluded from the financial assessment.</p>  <p>  If non-cash assets include land and property, the7.5% contribution based on this can be deferred by applying for an optional nursing home loan (Ancillary State Support).</p>  <p>  Another financial review can be requested 12 months after the first assessment or the most recent review. </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4.

It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p>  <p>  I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

This declining trend in Ireland has continued in recent years.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services was established by the Minister for Health to review the delivery of cardiac services nationally. The Review seeks to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive. The National Review covers scheduled and unscheduled hospital-based services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease in adults. Moreover, the Review considers the delivery of cardiac services nationally with a focus on the current prevention, detection and treatments of cardiovascular disease.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted on the progress of the review during 2020 and into 2021 as the Chair of the National Review has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response as a member of the NPHET and Chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group. However, the Cardiac Services Review is now making progress again, and the Steering Group reconvened in September 2021 with a view to finalisation of the Report. The Steering Group most recently met on 26/05/2022 and the next meeting is being planned. The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report. </p></reply>

In April I requested that the HSE set out the short term, immediate actions to alleviate the current situation in EDs, and ensure the system is best positioned for next winter. I also requested the development of a longer-term programme for reform and improvement of unscheduled care, to ensure that EDs are in a position to cater for expected increases in demand driven by population growth and an aging population.</p><p>I met with senior officials from the HSE on a number of occasions, most recently on 23rd June, to discuss the immediate responses required to tackle the pressures currently being faced by all 29 Emergency Departments across the country. I wrote to the HSE on 27th June to request the HSE urgently commence the implementation of the short-term measures identified for each ED.</p><p>My Department and the HSE will continue to work together to develop a programme building on these measures with a suite of longer-term actions to deliver systemic change to how unscheduled care is delivered. The overarching aim of this programme is to transform unscheduled care delivery across the full patient flow continuum in a structured, systemised and governed manner which is measurable and sustainable. This programme will adopt a 3-year phased approach. </p><p>The programme will be developed according to the &lsquo;Five Fundamentals of Unscheduled Care&rsquo;, which were designed and developed as an integrated framework to support sustainable and scalable unscheduled care improvement in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and goals. The Fundamentals were developed through an international review of published frameworks for improving unscheduled care performance. The five areas of focus are:</p><p>- Leadership, Culture and Governance</p><p>- Patient Flow at Pre-Admission</p><p>- Patient Flow at Post-Admission</p><p>- Integrated Community and Hospital Services</p><p>- Using Information to support sustainable Performance Improvement.</p><p>The patient will be at the centre of all initiatives. This framework follows a robust programmatic approach ensuring a standardised improvement approach is taken nationally while allowing for local bespoke improvement initiatives to be developed and locally owned. Enablers including data, reporting systems and project management will be provided in order to effect and sustain change. The approach is underpinned by the ethos &ndash; &lsquo;clinically led, excellently managed&rsquo;.</p><p>I will update the D&aacute;il further as this plan progresses.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The scheme will provide equitable access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.</p><p>Work is ongoing across three workstreams: </p><p>(i) Regulation of home-support providers </p><p>The Department is currently developing a regulatory framework for home-support providers with the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with high-quality care. This framework will comprise primary legislation for the licensing of providers, secondary legislation in the form of regulations (minimum requirements), and HIQA national standards. </p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to the Minister for Health to draft a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. The Heads of a Bill are at initial draft stage. There are 44 Heads. We are currently receiving legal advice on the wording. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>Development of regulations and standards are at an advanced stage. The Department has completed a targeted stakeholder consultation on draft regulations (minimum requirements) that will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a license will be determined. Draft regulations for home support providers have been developed by the department and amended following targeted stakeholder consultation. This has been enhanced by regular discussions with HIQA, HSE, Private Providers' representative groups and legal expertise assisting with legal text and interpretation of core issues, such as, capacity legislation, employment laws and health and safety issues. A 6-week public consultation was launched on 16th June.  www.gov.ie/en/consultation/81506-public-consultation-on-draft-regulations-for-providers-of-home-support-services/</p><p>HIQA have conducted an evidence review on home support which was published on May 30th. HIQA have developed standards for home care and home support services which will be the focus of a public consultation in September. The Department is represented on HIQA advisory group.</p><p>A regulatory impact analysis is being undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks. </p><p>(ii) Financing of home-support services </p><p>The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) undertook a programme of work on behalf of the Department on the potential demand for, and cost of, home support which culminated in two reports: </p><p>Demand for the Home Support Statutory Scheme (30 March 2021).</p><p>Home Support Services in Ireland: Exchequer and Distributional Impacts of Funding Options (24 February 2022). </p><p>This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population. </p><p>An internal consultation process on a range of potential funding options is underway. Targeted external consultation will follow in due course. </p><p>(iii) Reformed model of service delivery </p><p>The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home support is now fully operational. It commenced in November 2021 in CHO 8 and the three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home support scheme. </p><p>Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI care needs facilitators This will help to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. Recruitment of the Care Needs Facilitator posts will commence with a view to having the posts in place by the end of Q3 2022.</p><p>Approval and funding were provided in 2021 for the new National Older Persons Services Offices, that will encompass the National Home Support Office to be located in Tullamore. Funding is provided for 15 full time jobs including 9 Community Healthcare Organisation home support manager/coordinator posts. Recruitment of the Head of Service of the new National Home support Office has been advertised.</p><p>There are 9 staff in the Department working on the Statutory Home Support Scheme across the grades of EO to Assistant Secretary.</p></reply>

The lead role in developing the action plan rests with the HSE, in conjunction with Traveller organisations. A HSE steering committee, which included representatives of Traveller organisations, has drafted the action plan, to address the health needs of Travellers. The action plan will include actions relating to Traveller mental health. The plan is nearing finalisation and is due to be published in September.</p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) is the Government policy framework for addressing the health and other needs of Travellers. The Strategy includes 10 actions relating to mental health and suicide among Travellers. It acknowledges that mental health difficulties and the increased risk of suicide are significant issues for this community, caused by many social determinants. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, published in November 2021, contains 21 recommendations relating to the health, and mental health needs of Travellers. These actions and recommendations will be taken into account in the development of the Traveller health action plan. </p>  <p>  Travellers are noted as priority groups in the mental health policy, Sharing the Vision (STV) and suicide reduction strategy, Connecting for Life (CFL). Both recognise the vulnerability to and increased risk of mental health and suicidal behaviour by Travellers, and that these should be considered in the way mental health services are delivered to Travellers. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) provides funding (over &euro;600,000 over 2019 and 2020) to Exchange House to run the National Traveller Mental Health Service. It aims to improve the overall well-being of Travellers and reduce the likelihood of suicide or self-harm within the community.</p>  <p>  I am committed to providing the leadership and resources to ensure the implementation of the Traveller health action plan, once agreed. I want to work with all stakeholders to improve the health experiences and outcomes for Travellers, in a comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable manner.</p></reply>

My Department is at an advanced stage of developing a national policy on adult safeguarding specifically for the health and social care sector, the policy will cover all public, private, and voluntary settings including private nursing homes. It is anticipated that the policy will cover a wide range of issues, which may include rights of access to premises and records. As a national, sectoral policy it is envisaged that any such provisions would be applied consistently across all settings. In that regard, legislating for a right of access to any setting is a complex matter and the Department and other stakeholders would be required to consider any such a move very carefully to ensure that any such right would be evidence-based and proportionate. </p>  <p>  The Department expects in the near future to announce details of a public consultation with the intention of submitting a costed policy to the Government for its approval around the end of 2022. Any required underpinning legislation will be prepared following Government approval of the new policy.    </p></reply>

Regulation 9 provides that registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to uphold a residents&rsquo; right to access to independent advocacy services. </p>  <p>  The Patient Advocacy Service (PAS) is an independent health complaints advocacy service which was established by my Department in 2018. PAS provides a free and independent service to help users of public acute hospitals making or intending to make a formal complaint. The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future (2020) contained a commitment to examine extending the remit of PAS to residents of long-term residential care facilities. </p>  <p>  In February 2021, the original PAS contract was extended, and from June 2021 the service was offered to HSE-operated nursing homes and nursing homes operated under arrangement pursuant to Section 38. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) was awarded the contract for the next iteration of PAS. This next iteration of the service, commencing from November 2022, will include expansion to private nursing homes. </p>  <p>  In advance of the next iteration of PAS, my Department is examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector including key data, information on best practice, the level of standardisation, and the views of key stakeholders including residents and families, with a view to determining the need to develop enablers such as policy, legislative and/or guidance instruments. In parallel with this work, my Department is also examining whether any legislative amendments will be required to support the rollout of the advocacy service to private nursing homes.  </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. </p><p>Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1,  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5.  Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>6.  Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p><p>The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html.</p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE and will be completed as soon as possible. As of Friday, 1st July, more than 75,815 eligible HSE and Section 38 staff have received payment around the country. All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment. As eligibility is still being assessed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with an estimated number of public service workers who are eligible to receive the payment and have not yet received it. Nor can I advise on how many are eligible to receive the payment but have since retired.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<ol type="1"><li>Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</li><li>Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</li><li>Agency roles working in the HSE;</li><li>Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</li><li>Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</li><li>Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</li></ol>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers highlighted above has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers, or retirees who will receive the payment. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.</p>  <p>  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, the person concerned having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis in which the Minister has no role and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reform and service development will see the Government increase annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with an intake of 258 planned for this year.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

The then chair of the Alliance also convened a Vaccine Advocate Forum to offer information to organisations that had an integral role to play in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme. This event took place in December 2020 and more information is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c453f-covid-19-vaccine-advocate-forum/ </p>  <p>  The initial aim of the Alliance was to raise awareness about the benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s childhood vaccination programme, address vaccine hesitancy and ensure consistent messaging to stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of the Alliance shifted to include COVID-19 vaccines, addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation relating to COVID-19 vaccines. This work was primarily undertaken by members of the Alliance taking part in HSE stakeholder events relating to COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In addition, the HSE established the COVID-19 Vaccine Community Network in February 2021 to support uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. The Department and the HSE continue to work closely together to support these groups and progress the work of the Alliance.</p></reply>

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community. GPs are not employees of the HSE and any proposed model involving salaried GP positions would require careful consideration to ensure the required level of service could be provided for medical card and GP visit card holders.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Currently there are 2,551 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme.</p>  <p>  Where a GP GMS vacancy is set to arise in a practice, the HSE is notified in advance and becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. As of the 1st of June 2022, there are 33 GMS vacancies across the country, just over 1 percent of the total number of GMS panels; there is one GP GMS vacancy in Dublin North and two in Dublin North West.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is committed to increasing the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.  258 places will be available this year. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p></reply>

A Technical Guidance document has been developed and submitted to the EU Joint Action Steering Committee. A food industry EU-wide technical guidance is being prepared based on the WHO Nutrient Profiling Model, together with an outline on governance and monitoring. A document to encourage food companies and partner organisations to sign up to the Codes will be developed and a register of signatories will be maintained and published by the national monitoring bodies.</p>  <p>  A scientific evidence review on voluntary versus mandatory Codes is also being prepared.</p>  <p>  A workshop led by Ireland took place in May on Monitoring food advertising: Progress, experiences, challenges and solutions which included a review of global monitoring protocols.

This is having an impact on delivering routine, non-priority developmental screening assessments. This means that the service can no longer carry out Developmental Assessments for 3 month, 9-11months, 21-24 months and 46-48 months in vacant PHN caseloads.</p>  <p>  The Dublin West team have implemented a system which enables them to prioritise the screening services and address those needs while the staffing issue is being addressed. There are a number of reasons for the staff shortages:</p>  <p>  The Public Health Nursing Sponsorship Programme is currently the only route for recruitment into Public Health Nursing. The PHN Department supports the sponsorship of approx. 6- 8 standard PHNs annually however as per the National PHN Transfer Agreement (2015) PHNs who train apply for a transfer post their 18 months sponsorship. </p>  <p>  Since 2015 40 PHNs have transferred. Despite 3 recent cRGN recruitment campaigns the service has been unsuccessful in attracting candidates to the area. Staff retirement and staff moving to take up promotional opportunities have also reduced the number of PHNs in the area.</p>  <p>  From 2021 to 2022, 5 PHNs transferred and 5 PHNs commenced working as ADPHNs. This year the PHN Department has applied for standard PHNs and every effort is being made to recruit nurses.  There are 4 PHNs due to qualify in 2022 and these will be assigned to fill vacant PHN areas.</p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that they will continue to use transfer panels and recruit for Public Health Nurses across the area. The situation is expected to improve in coming months when student PHNs are allocated to the area.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Minister secured annual investment of &euro;195m to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme.   This investment is supporting a programmatic and integrated approach to the development of the primary and community care sector.  The ECC programme represents a significant expansion in primary care capacity, and will see some 3,500 additional staff recruited overall, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals.</p></reply>

I am pleased that there has been an overall improvement in compliance in recent years, acknowledging that further improvement is needed.  Together with the Department of Health, I will continue to work closely with both the Commission and the HSE to improve mental health services.   </p>  <p>  The report raises a range of issues around the delivery of mental health services. With regards to the issues raised concerning variance in compliance between independent providers and the HSE, the HSE cannot comment on the performance of private organisations. However, there is a significant case mix difference between patients in Private and Public Approved Centres. Additionally, National Community Mental Health Operation office are working closely with CHO4 in relation to compliance issues, most of which are premises related.  CHO4 have a comprehensive capital plan to accelerate the development of new in-patient units, and the national office are working with them to secure funding in this respect.</p>  <p>  Importantly, HSE Mental Health Services are committed to the delivery of high quality and safe mental health services. Both the Government and the HSE value the regulation of our mental health services as it provides a framework in which to constantly review and improve our services, so they remain person-centred. The HSE have reviewed the recommendations within the report and are confident that various initiatives currently underway address many of the recommendations made.</p>  <p>  The Government and I are committed to improving the quality of mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through implementation of our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.</p>  <p>  The need to build a more accountable and transparent health service is a focus of Sl&aacute;intecare and is also a key objective for Sharing the Vision. Sharing the Vision has a key focus on Accountability and Continuous Improvement as one of the policy&rsquo;s four core domains. This domain focuses on the organisational processes needed to implement and track delivery of the reforms proposed with an emphasis on innovation and continuous improvement. Key recommendations include developing a National Population Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research and Evaluation Strategy and the implementation of a national mental health information system. Additionally, the policy recommends that regular surveys of service users and family, carers and supporters be independently conducted to inform assessments of performance against PIs and target outcomes in Sharing the Vision, that mental health services ensure that the principles set out in the National Healthcare Charter, You and Your Health Service, are embedded in all service delivery and that training be provided for service users and staff on making and dealing with complaints.</p>  <p>For the complete list of recommendations to enhance accountability and continuous improvement through the policy implementation, I would direct you to the Sharing the Vision Policy document, and for details on the programme of implementation for the next three years, I would direct you to the Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024, which was published earlier this year. Both documents are available here - www.gov.ie/en/publication/2e46f-sharing-the-vision-a-mental-health-policy-for-everyone/ and official reports and analysis on Sharing the Vision Implementation Status are available here - www.gov.ie/en/publication/8f821-national-implementation-and-monitoring-committee-steering-committee/.</p>  <p>  In addition, the review of the 2001 Mental Health Act, on which work is ongoing, will help to put in place a more robust framework in which mental health services can be delivered.   </p>  <p>  As the question also concerns HSE services, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.   </p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations of the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.   </p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.   </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.   </p>  <p>  The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. The principal factors in determining the speed of reimbursement are therefore the price at which a manufacturer applies for the reimbursement of a product, the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s rigorous assessment process as to its clinical and cost-effectiveness, and the availability of Exchequer funding.   </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to providing timely access to new and innovative medicines to all patients, including for the treatment of rare diseases, as quickly as possible. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the reimbursement of new drugs. This enabled the HSE to approve fifty-two new medicines, nineteen of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the reimbursement of new medicines and as of 26 May the HSE has approved thirty new drugs in 2022,including three for the treatment of rare diseases.  </p></reply>

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.</p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations of the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.</p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.</p></reply>

Women&rsquo;s health remains a key priority for the Government and the Department of Health continue to focus on prioritising the care needs of women affected by mesh related complications. </p>  <p>  Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. However, in late 2017, in line with emerging international evidence, concerns were raised at national level regarding the frequency and severity of complications associated with the use of transvaginal mesh devices. The then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved.</p>  <p>  In November 2018, the CMO&rsquo;s Report on The Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures was published. The Report contains a number of recommendations regarding the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures. In July 2018, the CMO had asked the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation of the implementation of specific recommendations in the CMO&rsquo;s Report. This pause remains in place.</p>  <p>  In April 2019 the HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan to progress the recommendations detailed in this report and the National Women and Infants Health Programme continue to lead on this work for the HSE. </p>  <p>  In relation to the service provisions and supports in place to support women experiencing mesh related complications, multidisciplinary specialist services for women suffering from mesh complications are available via the HSE National Mesh Complications Service, based at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. This service has been operational since 1st September 2021. There are designated HSE contact points and associated care pathways to ensure that service needs can be identified and provided for and all persons affected by mesh are strongly encouraged to access these services via their clinical consultant.</p>  <p>  Trans-labial and transvaginal education and training was carried out in November 2021 by a Consultant Uro-Gynaecologist from Croydon University Hospital in the UK, on site in CUMH. The Mesh Complications Service will have a lead Consultant for this service at the two centres (NMH and CUMH) to facilitate trans-labial scanning.   </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the Department of Health of a Treatment Abroad Scheme protocol for mesh removal, for women with certain defined clinical complexities. This protocol aims to ensure timely access to care under the Treatment Abroad Scheme for this patient group where clinically appropriate.   </p>  <p>  A key priority is that all women affected by mesh are offered care. Consequently, women affected by mesh have been strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. Information on this, and a list of contact points, are available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

However, as a pre-2012 pensioner, they would have been subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) which was introduced in January 2011. This was a cut in public service pensions where the pre-PSPR value of the pension exceeded a specified amount.</p>  <p>  The FEMPI Act 2015 provided for a partial reversal of PSPR in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. Further amendments were provided for under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 for the years 2019 and 2020. PSPR was ceased fully on 1 July 2021.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) pension increase policy, the individual may be entitled to certain pension increases - DPER Circulars 20/2017, 2/2018, 19/2019 and 10/2021 refer.</p>  <p>  It has been confirmed by the HSE that all relevant increases have been applied to the individual's pension to date and that increases for 2021 are currently being reviewed. Should the individual be due a pension increase, it will be applied as soon as possible by the relevant HSE pensioner payroll. </p>  <p>  The individual also queried whether contributions they paid during their service would enable a pension payment to their spouse in the event of the individual's death. The HSE has confirmed that the person was not a member of the Widow's and Orphans/Spouses and Children's Superannuation Scheme which provides for pensions to spouses and children of deceased former members. However, it is advised that the individual make enquiries directly with their former employer, HSE West, who can be contacted at Pensions.West@hse.ie or by phoning (091) 775 487.</p></reply>

The introduction of the tax was an important action in the Obesity Policy and Action Plan, with the aim of combatting obesity through reducing consumption of added sugar in drinks and encouraging reformulation of products by the drinks industry.</p>  <p>  Initial indications are that the tax has had a positive impact, particularly in terms of encouraging drinks producers to reduce the sugar content in their products.  However, a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of the tax is needed, and the Department thus commenced an evaluation of the measure.</p>  <p>  The first step in this process was to look at existing examples that could inform the methodology to assess the impacts of the tax.  This literature review and data scoping exercise enabled the Department to make an assessment of the potential approaches to evaluate the impact of the tax and the timelines and resources required for the evaluation.  The Department has also developed links with researchers who are working on projects relevant to the evaluation topic, which has impacted upon the nature and timeline of the work. These timelines are currently being finalised. </p></reply>

The HSE National Consent Policy 2019 &ndash; Part 4 Do Not Attempt Resuscitation provides a decision-making framework that facilitates the advance discussion of personal preferences, while further guidance on DNAR decision-making was developed during the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is applicable across all care settings where services are provided for and on behalf of the HSE. </p>  <p>  Decisions relating to DNAR orders are part of the larger area of healthcare decisions that need to be made at the end-of-life. Best practice states that such decisions should be discussed as part of the advance care planning process. One method of achieving that goal is through an advance healthcare directive (AHDs). An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. Part 8 of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a legislative framework for AHDs, and allows for directive-makers to make legally binding decisions on matters including the refusal of life sustaining treatment. It is the responsibility the Department of Health to implement Part 8 of the 2015 Act, and it is planned that this will be done as part of the overall commencement of the Act, through the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022, which recently passed Report Stage in the D&aacute;il. </p></reply>

From a policy and budgetary point of view the Deputy may also be interested to note the following progress in areas such as enhancing all aspects of our mental health services and supports remains a key priority for Government. There have been significant improvements in the delivery of our mental health services over the past number of years and the Government is committed to ensuring their continued development throughout this year and into the future. I have outlined in my below response some of the key achievements in mental health in recent years. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to enhancing mental health services, is shown by significant mental health funding increases in recent years. I am pleased to have secured an unprecedented level of funding, totalling, &euro;1.149 billion, for mental health in this year&rsquo;s budget. This Budget, which is the largest mental health budget in the history of the state, is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 includes an additional &euro;47 million on 2021, comprising &euro;24 million for new developments, &euro;10 million for mental health initiatives in response to Covid and &euro;13 million for existing levels of service. An additional once off &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector.  </p>  <p>  Funding for a number of initiatives has been provided through the additional &euro;10 million An Taoiseach Covid Recovery fund. This includes &euro;2 million for continued enhancement of the HSE Digital Response programme and &euro;0.66 for a collaborative project with Jigsaw to build mental health literacy. </p>  <p>  In addition, through the additional once off &euro;10 million announced on Budget Day &euro;1m was provided for MyMind to continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, in over 15 languages, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. &euro;1m was also provided to Mental Health Ireland to manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department, to manage a grants scheme for community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and well-being.</p>  <p>  Funding allocated to mental health services in recent years has allowed for the continued investment in the mental health national clinical programmes and models of care, which has led to significant service improvements, including the full implementation of specialist perinatal mental health network provided for and the on-going expansion of specialist mental health teams for eating disorders, ADHD in adults, and dual diagnosis. </p>  <p>  Telehealth services are fully established including YourMentalHealth.ie; the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline, 50808, and NGO online supports. These include youth specific supports, such as those provided through Jigsaw, SpunOut, and Turn2Me. The majority of telehealth supports are available seven days per week, with some providing 24hour support. In addition, the HSE has partnered with SilverCloud, on a national roll out of digital cognitive behaviour therapy to address depression and anxiety and to make mental health support more widely available.</p>  <p>  Importantly, as budgets increase, we need to ensure that we have plans and strategies in place so that those resources are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of people using our mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030. </p>  <p>  In terms of implementation and oversight, the National Implementation Monitoring Committee (NIMC) implementation and implementation monitoring structures are well established, enabling policy implementation and governance. The NIMC is made up of the NIMC Steering Committee, supported by a NIMC Reference Group to provide the service user and family member perspective. The establishment of the Reference Group in March 2022 is a key development as it is absolutely vital that people who use our services and their families are at the heart of the design, development and delivery of the systems we build to serve them. </p>  <p>  NIMC Specialist Groups, have been established in priority areas of development including Youth Mental Health Transitions, Acute Inpatient Bed Capacity, Women&rsquo;s Mental Health, Primary Care Mental Health Services and Digital Mental Health. </p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024 was published on 23 March 2022.  The Plan sets out individual programme pathways of implementation for each of the 100 policy recommendations for the next three years. Additionally, official reporting has commenced with Status Implementation Reports and NIMC Analysis Documents published on a quarterly basis online. As of Q1 2022, 68 of the 100 recommendations are in implementation, with 51 marked on track.</p>  <p>  The implementation of Sharing the Vision will build on existing initiatives already underway, for example in the provision of digital mental health services, the continued phased development and rollout of our national clinical programmes, which are at the heart of service improvement, and the ongoing legislative reform through the review of the Mental Health Act. </p>  <p>  In mid-2021, the Government approved a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act. This General Scheme took into account the 165 recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the Act, the observations of key stakeholders such as the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, the results of a 2021 public consultation wherein 100 submissions were received, changes in domestic legislation, most significantly the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments, including under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  A Mental Health Bill is now being prepared in line with the General Scheme. The Bill will significantly update existing mental health legislation through, inter alia, the introduction of a set of guiding principles for adults and children receiving inpatient treatment, a revised set of criteria for detention, an overhauled approach to consent to admission and treatment, aligning capacity in mental health legislation with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the introduction of a new, discrete Part on the care and treatment of children, and the introduction of additional safeguards for people receiving inpatient mental health treatment. The finalisation and introduction to the Oireachtas of a Mental Health Bill is a priority for the Government and it will be introduced as quickly as possible when drafting concludes, which is expected later this year.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased to announce, in November 2020, the extension of Connecting for Life, our national suicide reduction strategy, by four years to 2024. This followed a recommendation from the independent strategy review conducted in 2018. It reflects the many achievements to date and the hard work and dedication of multiple stakeholders. The National Office for Suicide Prevention responsible for the implementation of Connecting for Life and overseen by the Department has a &euro;13 million allocation. The extension and continued implementation of Connecting for Life demonstrates the government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing suicide and self-harm in our communities.</p>  <p>  Following the Programme for Government commitment, the interdepartmental High-Level Taskforce was established by Government last year to enhance links for those in contact with the criminal justice system accessing Mental Health, Addiction or Primary Care services. Significant progress has been made by the Taskforce, under the Chair of former Minister Kathleen Lynch, and a Final Report will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  As the question also concerns operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This level of investment in primary care reform is unprecedented and is intended to address historical capacity deficits in the sector. It forms part of wider efforts to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare and the promise of care being delivered in the right place at the right time and as close to home as possible.  The ECC programme includes a number of different elements that will bolster primary care services across the country.  Amongst other initiatives, the funding will allow for the rollout of 96 Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) to be completed and enables the continued development of 30 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons, and 30 Community Specialist Teams for the Management of Chronic Diseases.</p>  <p>  79 of the planned 96 CHNs are now in place.  It is expected that all 96 networks will be operational by the end of this year.19 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons are now established, with 8 Specialist Teams for Chronic Disease Management already implemented.  Full nationwide coverage by the Community Intervention Teams has been achieved with 21 now operational across the country.</p>  <p>  The ECC programme represents a significant expansion in primary care capacity, and will see some 3,500 additional staff recruited overall, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals.  Some 2,000 staff have been recruited, and approximately 1500 staff will be onboarded by year end. </p>  <p>  We will also continue to develop new, state of the art Primary Care Centres (PCCs) to support the provision of the very highest standards of primary care.  There are now 152 PCCs open nationwide, and 19 more are scheduled to become operational over the course of 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, several measures pertaining to General Practice will be implemented or expanded upon in 2022.  The Minister ensured that Budget 2022 provided for the provision of GP care without charges to all children aged 6 and 7.   This is the first stage of the phased expansion of GP care without charges to all children aged 12 years and under.  </p>  <p>  The Chronic Disease Management programme, which commenced in 2020 and was modified to facilitate remote reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic, is also being extended in 2022 to all adult GMS patients, while work is ongoing to explore the potential to further enhance the GP Access to Diagnostics programme introduced in 2021.</p>  <p>  These investments and reforms are a demonstration of the commitment to shift the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care closer to people&rsquo;s home in communities across the country.</p></reply>

The 2022 HSE National Service Plan also available on HSE website sets out the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE this year.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits the government to &lsquo;Introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care&rsquo;.  In Budget 2021, I secured additional funding of <b>&euro;150 million</b>for home support to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide <b>5 million</b>additional hours of home support or more than 25% above the 2020 target.  The funding for these additional hours has been maintained for 2022.</p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to the Minister for Health to draft a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. The drafting of the Heads of a Bill is at an advanced stage and it is intended to bring this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. In tandem to this, draft regulations setting out the minimum requirements a home support provider must meet to obtain a licence are also at an advanced stage. A public consultation on these regulations is ongoing.</p><p>Testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home-support has commenced in four pilot sites. Last week, I announced the commencement of the recruitment of 128 Care Needs Facilitator posts to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community. It is planned to have these posts in place by the end of Q3 2022. InterRAI standardised outputs will be used to determine prioritisation and levels of care required. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. Recruitment to posts to run this new office are at an advanced stage, and office buildings have been sourced.</p><p>I am very much aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector.  I have established a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine issues such as recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future, so that solutions can be identified and implemented. Ensuring an adequate supply of appropriately skilled healthcare support assistants and healthcare assistants is a key objective of this initiative.  The Group which is currently engaging with key sectoral stakeholders is committed to providing me with a set of recommendations by September.</p><p>Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities and the reopening of these centres are a priority for me. The re-opening of day care centres following their necessary closure in 2020 began in the second half of 2021 and continues into 2022. About 85% of Day Care Services for Older People are open and have resumed service and by the end of 2022 it is expected that 92% of Day Care Centres will have resumed the service.</p><p>In 2021 the HSE has commenced the implementation of the Enhanced Community Care programme which aims to deliver increased levels of healthcare with service delivery reoriented towards general practice, primary care, and community-based services. Work continues on the roll-out and establishment of community healthcare networks and community specialist teams for older people and for chronic disease management. The National Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) forms part of the ECC Programme and seeks to ensure older people with complex care needs can access care quickly, at or near home, through care pathways specifically designed for older people and targeting Frailty, Falls, and Dementia.</p><p>The Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) has worked with acute hospitals and their local community older person&rsquo;s services to develop end-to end care pathways for older people with complex care needs.</p><p>A total of 30 ICPOP Community Specialist Teams will be established across the country to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare principle of delivering care as close to people&rsquo;s home as appropriate. Each Community Specialist Team will service a population on average of 150,000 across an average of 3 CHNs. The teams will be co-located together in &lsquo;hubs&rsquo; located in or adjacent to Primary Care Centres, reflecting the shift in focus away from the acute hospital towards general practice, a primary care &amp;amp; community-based service model. As of May 2022, 19 of 30 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons are now established. The full complement of 30 ICPOP teams will be established by Q3 2022</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis and to respond in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.Furthermore, an independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes. The Expert Panel recommendations have provided a guiding framework not only for the pandemic response in nursing homes over the last two years but also more broadly for a wide-ranging programme of improvement and reform for older persons&rsquo; care, in particular in residential care settings. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on the 21st of June 2022. This progress report sets out the progress achieved across the 86 recommendations in the Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s report and outlines the plans and structures in place to continue implementation along with details of next steps and timelines. It is available here - www.gov.ie/en/publication/c7f5b-covid-19-nursing-homes-expert-panel-report-implementation-oversight-team/#progress-reports  </p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021 introduced further safeguards into the NHSS, also known as Fair Deal, to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. It also introduced a change which extends the three-year cap on contributions to the sale of a personal residence, removing a disincentive against the sale of a property. My Department has also developed an amendment to reduce the rate of at which rental income is assessed under the NHSS, to remove a disincentive to the rental of vacant homes owned by residents in long-term care. This change will be enacted imminently and the legislation will be commenced once appropriate preparations have been made within the HSE to ensure it can be operated effectively and in a way that addresses concerns I have raised in relation to safeguarding, consent and capacity.</p><p>Furthermore, if residents wish to make their properties available to house refugees without charge, this will have no impact on their contributions to the scheme. It is also anticipated that the financial contribution for hosting of temporary protection beneficiaries will be exempt from means-testing under the NHSS, once the related legislation, which is currently with the Oireachtas, has been enacted.</p><p>My Department is at an advanced stage of developing a national policy on adult safeguarding specifically for the health and social care sector, the policy will cover all public, private, and voluntary settings including private nursing homes. The Department expects in the near future to announce details of a public consultation with the intention of submitting a costed policy to the Government for its approval around the end of 2022. Any required underpinning legislation will be prepared following Government approval of the new policy.</p><p>I have long been an advocate for the development of services for people with dementia and their families and this is representative in the focused investment in these supports and services in recent years. A key commitment of the Programme for Government is to continue implementing the National Dementia Strategy with an aim of improving dementia supports and services so that people living with dementia can live well for as long as possible.</p><p>Funding of <b>&euro;12.9million</b>for dementia specific supports and services in 2021 allowed for substantial advancements in the areas of:</p><p>-  Enhanced Memory Technology Resource Rooms in 9 sites across the country </p><p>-  Dementia diagnostic services through a specialist regional memory clinic in Cork and four new memory assessment and support services in Mayo, Wexford, Waterford and Sligo </p><p>-  Enhancement of acute care pathways for people with dementia through the recruitment of more clinical  nurse specialists </p><p>-  The implementation of a National Clinical Guideline on the appropriate prescribing of psychotropic medication for non-cognitive symptoms in people with dementia </p><p>-  Increased access to in-home day care and support and </p><p>-  Dementia: Understand Together initiatives </p><p>In addition, in November 2021 I officially launched an expansion of the National Dementia Advisor Service. The Dementia Adviser Service provides a key focal point to help people navigate the health and social care system, ensuring they receive the right support at the right time. I was delighted to secure funding for 11 new dementia advisers in 2021, to expand this vital service. This brought the total number of dementia advisers to 28 nationally. </p><p>In 2022, an additional &euro;7.3million has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will work to continue to improve care pathways for people with dementia across the country. </p><p>Funding in 2022 will allow for substantial advancements in the areas of: </p><p>-  5 new memory assessment and support services and one new regional specialist memory clinic in Galway </p><p>-  Specialist diagnostic services for people with an intellectual disability through the National Intellectual Disability Memory Service in Tallaght University Hospital </p><p>-  Enhancement of memory technology resource rooms to demonstrate assistive technology options for people living with dementia </p><p>-  Implementation of a dementia minimum dataset across all care settings to standardise data collection and reporting </p><p>-  6 dementia assistant director of nursing posts (one in each hospital group) to improve quality and safety of care for people with dementia </p><p>-  4 additional dementia clinical nurse specialists to improve care pathways in acute care settings </p><p>-  Undertake the third wave of the Irish National Audit of Dementia in acute hospitals </p><p>-  Promote brain health and reduce the prevalence and delay the onset of dementia through collaboration with clinical programmes, the understand together campaign and dementia risk reduction group through the provision of a brain health project manager</p><p>In addition to the &euro;7.3m for dementia services outlined above, the proportion of new home support hours ringfenced for people with dementia will more than double from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022.</p><p>Taken together, this will represent 15 million euro of investment dedicated to dementia specific supports and services in 2022, on top of the &euro;12.9m of additional funding in 2021.</p></reply>

Vessels in the Rockall squid fishery could tie-up for 2 months at these rates.  In total, some 179 vessels availed of this scheme at a cost of &euro;10 million.</p>  <p>  I introduced this tie-up scheme again last month and it will operate until October or November this year.  To further assist the fishing fleet in these difficult times, I am allowing each vessel to receive aid for 2 months in 2022.  Already, some 67 vessels availed of the scheme for the month of June.  </p>  <p>  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme operated over January to March and was availed of by 754 inshore fishing vessel owners at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  The scheme provided aid of &euro;2,700 to owners of vessels under 8 metres and &euro;4,000 to owners of vessels of 8 to 18 metres.  Each participant was provided with a suite of 4 training modules to assist them in adjusting their business to the post Brexit environment.  In addition, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme is underway and is investing &euro;600,000 in 2022 in promoting stocks of interest to inshore fishers to support prices at the quayside.</p>  <p>  Separately, a &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme is open for applications at present, with the aim of supporting the seafood processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of Brexit, and assisting the sector to move further up the supply chain to produce higher value seafood products.  Grants of up to 50% for capital investment are available.  </p>  <p>  For coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme is open for applications and aims to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit on businesses operating in the blue economy in our coastal regions.  The scheme offers aid of up to &euro;200,000 for capital investments and also offers aid for training and mentoring. </p>  <p>  Further support schemes are anticipated in coming months, including a voluntary decommissioning scheme, subject to State Aid clearance.</p>  <p>  In relation to the impacts of increased energy costs arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine, Government is acutely conscious of the impacts across the economy.  This matter is being kept under constant review and is the subject of ongoing consultation with representatives of our seafood sector.</p></reply>

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.   </p>  <p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, other than Northern Irish vessels under the Voisinage Agreement, no EU Member State or Third Country has access to our 0-6 nautical miles zone.  France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have access for specific species in various areas of the 6-12 nautical mile zone along Ireland&rsquo;s West, East and South coasts.  Ireland does not have access to any other Member States&rsquo; 6-12 nautical mile zones.</p>  <p>  Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the Common Fisheries Policy Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013). </p>  <p>  I had sought that this issue be dealt with in the context of the CFP Review.  The matter of access to waters for fishing fleets is a sensitive issue and cannot be looked at in isolation.  However, the Commission views this as a technical amendment.  This means that the proposal is moving ahead of the CFP review process. </p>  <p>  I had initially sought to extend Ireland&rsquo;s current exclusive 6 nautical mile zone out to 12 nautical miles and create a new restricted zone between 12nm and 20nm with access for fleets with traditional fishing activity in that zone.  Both of these changes were intended to provide a level playing field for Irish vessels and to enhance the sustainable exploitation of stocks within Ireland's 12 nautical mile zone.</p>  <p>  Having carefully considered the concerns of some Member States, and in the spirit of compromise, I removed the request for restricted access to the 12-20nm zone.  However, I continued to argue for an amendment to seek exclusive access to the 12 nautical miles zone around Ireland for our own fishing fleet.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit.   </p>  <p>  I have had ongoing engagement with Commissioner Sinkevicius on this issue.  I have also been engaging  with the French, Belgian, Dutch and German Fisheries Ministers.  In May, I met with the French Fisheries Minister to further discuss my proposal and Ireland's concerns.  France is the most impacted of the four Member States and France currently has the Council Presidency.  On the margins of the May Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I met with the Dutch and German Fisheries Ministers to discuss this matter further.</p>  <p>  I highlighted in particular the unacceptable impact of the TCA on our fisheries and the importance of a re-examination and full review of the CFP to ensure a fair,  balanced and equitable policy, and explained the strong case for my proposal in relation to our 12 miles zone.  </p>  <p>  Other Member States did not support Ireland's proposal and on 1st June a Council General Approach  on the rollover of the derogations was adopted with only Ireland opposed.</p>  <p>  However, Ireland was able to secure an amendment to the text which provides that both the duration and scope of this extension to the derogations may be revised in the framework of any review of the CFP.</p>  <p>  The draft Regulation is due to be discussed by the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee later this month.  Once the Parliament has adopted its negotiating position, trilateral negotiations between the Council, European Parliament and Commission will commence.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value adding in the project. </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit, while also building more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. The scheme is aimed at supporting industry led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material and at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets. The scheme will be proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  The scheme received State Aid clearance on the basis that it provides supports to SMEs only.  This is consistent with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines which require consistency with the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014), which in turn restricts grant aid to the processing sector to SMEs only.  Both article 69 of the EMFF Regulation for the 2014-20 period and article 28 of the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021/1139) for the 2021-27 period restrict grant supports for capital investment in seafood processing to SMEs.  Supports to non-SMEs is permitted only through financial instruments.</p></reply>

The EU sanction prohibiting Russian-flagged vessels accessing EU ports has an explicit derogation to allow for the import of agricultural and food products.</p>  <p>  My Department made four recommendations to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; as the relevant Competent Authority - for authorisation of derogations under Article 3ea(5) of the Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (as amended) to allow Russian flagged vessels dock in Irish ports. These derogations for imports of animal feed met specific criteria, were in respect of  purchases contracted  prior to Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine and have since been landed in Irish ports. At this point it is not anticipated that there will be any further use of the derogation. </p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with feed industry representatives. Feed import companies have been actively engaged in sourcing alternative feed materials from existing and new sources, and regular commercial activities in this regard are ongoing. </p>  <p>  In addition, I continue to encourage farmers to devote more land for arable use through the Tillage Incentive and Protein/Cereal Schemes which will bring significant benefits to reduce our future reliance on imported commodities albeit recognising that Ireland has a major deficit in grain production.</p></reply>

The &euro;56 million nationwide scheme aims to incentivise farmers, in particular drystock farmers to grow more fodder (silage and/or hay) to ensure Ireland does not have any animal welfare issues over the coming winter and next spring. Securing sufficient fodder will be more of a challenge in the beef and sheep sectors than it is for the dairy sector. There is currently no plan to expand the Fodder Support Scheme to expand the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to farmers who meet all the eligibility criteria set out in the Terms and Conditions.  To be eligible for the fodder support scheme a farmer must have eligible grassland declared on their 2022 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) application, including grassland that is Area of Natural Constraints (ANC) Category 1 land. </p>  <p>  The land applied on must be land on which either hay or silage is cut and conserved on before 05 September 2022.

For example, in Wexford, every flexibility was given in relation to the SICAP Programme from the time of the first arrivals into the county.

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, I launched our National Hubs Network - Connected Hubs.  Connected Hubs is a shared online booking and payments platform for member hubs and their users.  There are currently some 250 remote and co-working facilities across the State on Connected Hubs, including both private and publicly run hubs. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;100m has been invested in recent years in the development of remote working facilities through programmes implemented by my Department.   For example, under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, many  applications focusing on the development of remote working hubs have been developed and submitted by local authorities in consultation with local community and business groups.  Similarly, my Department has provided some &euro;14m over the course of the 2021 and 2022 Connected Hubs Call for public and privately owned hubs to develop their capacity and facilities.</p>  <p>  The LEADER programme may also be of relevance to the Deputy's question.

BCPs are publicly accessible sites, such as community centres and GAA clubs, in rural and isolated areas that make onsite internet services available to local communities. There are currently 273 of these community hubs completed and open to the public. The remaining 27 will be completed this year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, given the level of investment and support that my department provides to hubs and to remote workers, I am a frequent visitor to hubs across the country. While it is not possible to give an exact figure, I can confirm that during my Our Rural Future rural roadshows in 2021 and 2022 I have visited numerous hubs and BCPs all across rural Ireland, as well as regularly visiting hubs while on other business.

It should also be noted that a deferred surrender of &euro;16.9 million in capital funding was carried forward from 2021 for use in 2022, meaning total funding of &euro;395.5 million is available for use in 2022. </p><p>The 2022 gross allocation for my Department, of &euro;378.6 million, represents an 8% increase on the 2021 allocation of &euro;351 million, and builds further on strong funding growth in previous years. This increased funding for 2022 has allowed additional investment across our schemes, which are supporting communities right across the country. The funding has also allowed strong progress in the implementation of relevant actions in Our Rural Future, and the establishment of the new Community Centre Fund. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Programme/Scheme Area</th>       <th>REV 2022 (Current)</th>       <th>REV 2022   (Capital)</th>       <th>REV 2022 (Total)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>V42 - RURAL &amp;amp; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT   (GROSS)</td>       <td>186,548</td>       <td>192,000</td>       <td>378,548</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A - RURAL DEVELOPMENT, REGIONAL AFFAIRS   &amp;amp; ISLANDS</td>       <td>33,039</td>       <td>169,216</td>       <td>202,255</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.1 - ADMINISTRATION - PAY</td>       <td>6,543</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>6,543</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.2 - ADMINISTRATION - NON PAY</td>       <td>915</td>       <td>96</td>       <td>1,011</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.3 - WESTERN DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION</td>       <td>2,266</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2,266</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.4 - RURAL SUPPORTS</td>       <td>12,516</td>       <td>18,356</td>       <td>30,872</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.5 - LEADER </td>       <td>0</td>       <td>48,000</td>       <td>48,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.6 - REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</td>       <td>2,260</td>       <td>1,120</td>       <td>3,380</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.7 - RURAL REGENERATION AND   DEVELOPMENT </td>       <td>0</td>       <td>97,000</td>       <td>97,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A.8 - ISLANDS </td>       <td>8,539</td>       <td>4,644</td>       <td>13,183</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</td>       <td>148,903</td>       <td>22,784</td>       <td>171,687</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.1 - ADMINISTRATION - PAY</td>       <td>4,679</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>4,679</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.2 - ADMINISTRATION - NON PAY</td>       <td>790</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>854</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.3 - SUPPORTS FOR COMMUNITY &amp;amp;   VOLUNTARY SECTOR</td>       <td>18,344</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>18,345</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.4 - SICAP - LOCAL/REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT   SUPPORTS</td>       <td>51,066</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>51,066</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.5 - LOCAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT   COMMITTEES </td>       <td>2,405</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2,405</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.6 - SUPPORTS FOR DISADVANTAGED   COMMUNITIES</td>       <td>6,233</td>       <td>1,267</td>       <td>7,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.7 - DORMANT ACCOUNTS MEASURES</td>       <td>9,897</td>       <td>2,673</td>       <td>12,570</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.8 - PROGRAMME FOR PEACE AND   RECONCILIATION</td>       <td>4,317</td>       <td>2,650</td>       <td>6,967</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.9 - WATER SAFETY IRELAND</td>       <td>1,179</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1,179</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.10 - LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT AND ARCHIVE   SERVICE</td>       <td>1,102</td>       <td>6,629</td>       <td>7,731</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.11 &ndash; COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMME</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>9,500</td>       <td>9,501</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B.12 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMME</td>       <td>48,890</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>48,890</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>C - CHARITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY</td>       <td>4,606</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>4,606</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the LIS is funded into the future. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  From 2017 to 2021, my Department allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p>  <p>  I was pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year. I announced details of the 2022 LIS in early April, which included &euro;644,070 for Tipperary County Council. </p>  <p>  Last year, I was in a position to double the initial LIS allocation to &euro;21 million following the identification of savings in other capital areas. This year, I am continuing to closely monitor expenditure patterns. Should savings emerge, I will give consideration to again allocating additional funding to the scheme.</p></reply>
