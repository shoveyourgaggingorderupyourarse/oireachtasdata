The strategy sets out the Government&rsquo;s framework for housing delivery for people with disabilities, including mental, physical, intellectual and sensory disabilities. It was developed in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Flowing from the Strategy, local authorities have been mandated to set up Housing and Disability Steering Groups which are tasked with achieving a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability, including mental health difficulties. The Housing Agency has also developed a manual to assist local authority staff to support people with mental health difficulties to access housing. </p>  <p>  While not all people with mental health difficulties require a specific type of housing, in many cases social care supports are required to assist with adjusting to independent living, which includes issues such as maintaining a tenancy. Together with the Department of Health, my Department currently co-funds a Tenancy Sustainment programme nationally to assist persons with mental health difficulties transitioning from HSE facilities into mainstream social housing to maintain their tenancies. </p>  <p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability will be reviewed in 2020 and housing for people with mental health difficulties will again form part of the considerations in that review. </p></reply>

Funding of &euro;200 million was originally made available under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million would be provided by the Exchequer with local authorities providing matching fund of &euro;50 million. Approval was given for 30 projects under LIHAF in 2017 and these projects will stimulate the development of approximately 20,000 homes across 14 local authorities.  </p>  <p>  The LIHAF projects are progressing, with two projects completed and almost half of all projects at construction stage. My Department is currently reviewing progress on the remaining projects and will complete a LIHAF update by the end of the year. Over 1,800 homes associated with the infrastructure delivery have been delivered to date, with a further 4,000 homes expected to be delivered in 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), announced in November 2018, is a flagship element of Project Ireland 2040 and is supported by funding of &euro;2 billion over the period to 2027. The URDF was established to support more compact and sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.   This will ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.  While it is not intended that the URDF would provide direct support for particular housing projects, public infrastructure that might previously have been appropriate to a LIHAF application could be included in a URDF application in support of compact urban growth.  Through the Fund, successful applicants are being offered targeted integrated support for applicant-led projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of our cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Although submission of funding applications and the advancement of each project is, in the first instance, a matter for each applicant, my Department is working closely and actively with them to ensure that the projects receiving URDF support come to fruition as soon as possible. The 88 projects approved under the first call offer a good regional spread, and span a number of themes.  I will be announcing a second call for proposals under the URDF shortly.</p></reply>

A central action within it is a commitment to develop a National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy. This Strategy, which I published July 2018, strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across the country and draws together all of the strands of ongoing work into one document, with a clear vision for moving forward in the next few years.  In addition, each local authority has established a Vacant Homes Office and prepared a Vacant Homes Action Plan, supported by dedicated funding provided by my Department.</p><p>This approach has allowed the development of innovative approaches, such as the website vacanthomes.ie developed by Mayo County Council in July 2017 on behalf of the local government sector.  This site acts as a central portal for individuals to log possible vacant homes and is proving useful in supplementing the country-wide analysis on vacancy and in mobilising communities to assist local authorities in developing and implementing a targeted approach.  Some 3,422 properties have been registered to date. </p><p>The website provides useful information for property owners on how to bring their vacant properties back into use and on available financial supports.  This includes a number of schemes developed by my Department  to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock.  In that regard, by the end of Q3 2019: </p><p>- The Repair and Leasing initiative resulted in 1,510 applications;129 homes have been brought back into use and tenanted, with 155 agreements for lease signed.  </p><p>- The Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme has facilitated local authority purchase 470 vacant properties for social housing purpose; - Through the revolving acquisitions fund of &euro;70 million managed by the Housing Agency since January 2017, a total of 669 properties have been made available to Approved Housing Bodies and a further 116 properties are in the process of being secured; and </p><p>- The Housing Agency has also supported local authorities to acquire a further 374 vacant properties from financial institution for social housing purposes with a further 112 proceeding through to sale. </p><p>This effectively means that in addition to the 600 properties brought back into use to date under the Buy &amp;amp; Renew and Repair &amp;amp; Leasing Schemes, more than 1,200 other vacant properties held by financial institutions have been secured for social housing use since 2016.Local authorities are also bringing homes into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties.  In overall terms, CSO data indicates that reconnections of properties vacant for at least 2 years and completions of homes in unfinished estates account for some 13,800 of the 70,800 new homes that have become available for use in the period 2016 to Q3 2019.</p><p>Tackling vacancy will continue to be the focus of targeted attention by my Department and local authorities over the remaining years of Rebuilding Ireland. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-11a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121100069#WRB02300"><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the potential role that Credit Unions can play in housing finance and supported the efforts of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current investment restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.</p>  <p>  Credit Union bodies have set out proposed means by which funding could be provided by the sector to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the development of social housing.  This follows on from the amendments introduced by the Central Bank to the regulatory regime within which Credit Unions operate. </p>  <p>  My Department referred the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes. The work of the ICSH was supported by grant funding from my Department.  In addition, both my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, and I have met with the Credit Union movement and the AHB sector on this matter.</p>  <p>  The ICSH, along with 6 Tier 3 AHBs, have worked with specialist financial advisers to establish a funding mechanism or vehicle which would source suitable sources of non-state finance to fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs, based on best value for money. Market testing undertaken revealed good interest in lending to the AHB sector from various lenders including banks, institutional investors and the Credit Union sector. So far, one AHB has set up an SPV, 2 AHBs have sourced private finance from  a private institution and there are 2 AHBs looking at the next phase of establishing a structure to work collectively in securing private finance. As such, the work in this area is ongoing and has led to individual AHBs establishing SPVs for financing social housing.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union sector is one potential funder whose terms are assessed as part of the process of market testing to establish best value for money and optimum terms and conditions from lenders.  While my Department will continue to be available to provide any clarifications that may be required in relation to social housing delivery, it falls to the relevant parties, i.e. the AHBs, on the one hand, and potential investors on the other, to agree a workable and mutually acceptable approach in order to bring potential investment possibilities to a successful conclusion.</p></reply>

The statutory position is very clear in terms of where responsibilities lie under the Building Control Acts, the Fire Services Acts, the Housing Acts, the Planning and Development Acts and the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, all or some of which may be relevant in individual cases of building defects.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, in particular, have brought further clarity in relation to the respective roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in construction projects.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under many of the legislative codes referred to in order to ensure that parties discharge their statutory responsibilities.  But it would not be appropriate for local authorities to take on a role of the kind suggested in adjudicating or providing mediation on the matters involved, particularly when the issues arising when homeowners discover defects in their homes can involve complex legal matters, with potential implications also for insurance.  </p>  <p>  The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings.  Nor could the taxpayer afford such a role.  It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance. </p></reply>

This site can yield approximately 600 homes, which are likely to be primarily social and affordable housing. Ultimately, any decision regarding the ownership and development of the site will be a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  As provided for under Section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001, any decision to dispose of local authority land, including to the LDA, is a reserved function of its elected members. </p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government recently carried out pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the LDA Bill. It is important to note that the General Scheme provides that the shareholders (i.e. owners) of the LDA will be the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p></reply>

Following the recent incidents, water provided by the Leixlip plant is currently safe, and is not subject to a restriction.  However, the plant remains in need of improvement works that will make it resilient and prevent future issues.</p>  <p>  I remain concerned about the vulnerability of this plant. My focus is firstly, to ensure that Irish Water continues to prioritise and progress the improvement works; and secondly, that appropriate protocols are in place to deal with any future issues at the plant while the works are underway.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is undertaking improvements to the plant as recommended by EPA audits as quickly as is practical.  While works are progressing on the plant, water production has been reduced by c30 million litres per day. Irish Water has increased water production from other plants, particularly Ballymore Eustace, to compensate. These are operational matters for Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In relation to the recent boil water notices, I and my Department have engaged with all the organisations involved to review the response to the incidents. In addition, I have in recent days, received the EPA&rsquo;s report on the two boil water notices which I requested from the Agency. I am meeting with the EPA, the HSE, Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and An F&oacute;ram Uisce today to agree actions following the EPA report.</p>  <p>  While the water being produced at Leixlip is safe, the risk of further boil water notices continues until the upgrade works are finalised in the first half of next year.</p>  <p>  The EPA will continue to provide regulatory oversight of Irish Water, and work closely with Irish Water and the HSE to ensure the protection of human health.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, overall, the additional water capacity available in the Greater Dublin Area is extremely low.  Irish Water has medium and long term plans to increase the supply to the Greater Dublin Area and to improve the resilience of the existing infrastructure, in particular through the development of the proposed Midlands and Eastern Water Supply Project. In the meantime, Irish Water and the local authorities are monitoring demand and supply capacity on a daily basis and will continue to balance the network to minimise possible impacts on customers.</p></reply>

Moreover, local authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way to ensure that long-term strategic housing needs are met across all types and tenures within their functional area.  This applies to both urban and rural locations.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland to support the delivery of homes to buy or rent at prices which are discounted on market values, the Government has allocated &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 more affordable homes on local authority lands.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites.</p>  <p>  To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  This funding was awarded to local authorities on a competitive basis. </p>  <p>  One of these projects includes a bid from Kildare County Council for the development of a site at Ardclough Road, Celbridge.  This project received approval in principle in August 2019 and will facilitate the delivery of 10 affordable homes. The overall cost and the timing of delivery for this and other projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and Kildare County Council is working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. I anticipate that a further call for proposals under the SSF will issue in 2020. </p>  <p>  Another project at Maynooth in County Kildare is being funded under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) at a cost of over &euro;14.5m. This public infrastructure project will be key to the delivery of approximately 720 cost reduced homes.   </p>  <p>  These schemes complement some of the other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported over 16,500 households nationally.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which is administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development, seeks to support ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities.  The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over 10 years to the Fund and &euro;315 million is allocated to the Fund for the period 2019-2022. In this area, my Department will also work with the local authorities and other infrastructure providers to develop a programme of serviced sites to attract people to build their own homes and live in smaller towns and villages as mandated by the National Planning Framework. </p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p><p>The Government has introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, following a review of the previous two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers  with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>As with previous local authority house purchase loan finance, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources. </p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns for the RIHL. Local authority approval means that an official letter of offer has been sent to a borrower (and therefore relates to a specific property and loan amount). Information on the RIHL up to Quarter 2 2019, including in relation to the number and value of mortgage approvals and drawdowns and also average loan amounts, is available on the Department's website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and DIRT paid over the previous four tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000. As of 30 November 2019, 15,903 HTB claims had been approved, to a value of &euro;236m.</p><p>The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure extended the initiative in its current form in Budget 2020.  This means that the HTB initiative will remain in place for another two years until 31 December 2021.</p></reply>

This mainly comprises income from goods and services, commercial rates, Government grants and Local Property Tax.</p>  <p>  Between 2015 and 2019, Irish Water was not liable for commercial rates and approximately &euro;47m p.a. was paid to local authorities to compensate them for the water services-related rates income they would have previously received.   Having regard to a recommendation from the local government sector that this exemption from rates should be removed, Irish Water will become liable for commercial rates from 2020 and the compensation-related funding will cease.  Irish Water will pay commercial rates directly to individual local authorities, following the global valuation process undertaken by the Commissioner for Valuation, in a similar arrangement as applies to other utilities.  The majority of local authorities are expected to see an increase in their rates income arising from this process. </p>  <p>  Of course, this is just one of a number of variables that feed into local authority budgets.  For example, there have also been revaluations of other utilities and all of the local authorities likely to lose rates income from the Irish Water valuation would be likely to see their rates income increase from the ESB revaluation.   In addition, there is funding made available from the Local Government Fund (LGF) and the Exchequer funding of &euro;156m being made available through the Local Government Fund (LGF), on a like-for-like basis, will see local authorities receiving &euro;23 million more in Exchequer funding when compared to 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department has kept the anticipated financial impact of the changed approach to the rating of Irish Water under review, liaising directly with sectoral representatives and with the most impacted authorities, particularly in the case of the seven authorities who are expected to receive less in the resulting commercial rates than they received previously.  Taking account of other expected changes in incomes and the financial positions of the authorities concerned, Waterford City and County Council and Wicklow County Council were identified as facing significant challenges to deliver balanced budgets in the first year of the changeover.</p>  <p>  Therefore, Minister Murphy and I are providing a once-off special payment of &euro;2 million to Waterford City and County Council and &euro;300,000 to Wicklow County Council to assist them in 2020 and to allow more time for the necessary rebalancing of income and expenditure.  </p>  <p>  Income from commercial rates is for use by local authorities at their discretion and, owing to its nature, is subject to fluctuations from time to time. My Department will continue to monitor the financial impact of the transition of Irish Water to a global utility undertaking for rates purposes, as part of its wider role  in supporting local authorities. It is also my intention to consider this issue and other relevant issues when the work of the Local Government Funding Baseline (Review) Group falls to be considered.</p></reply>

As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards, to which site owners will become liable with effect from January 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively over 340 individual sites currently on the local registers. Over 80 of these sites were entered on registers on 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  While application of the levy provisions is a matter for individual local authorities, my Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  To support this work, progress reports were requested from local authorities and the responses received are currently being examined by my Department to see what further implementation supports may be required.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure the vacant site levy achieves its full potential. However, I have no plans to further amend the vacant site levy provisions at this time.  </p></reply>

Under this Act, there are no requirements to be met in respect of licensing or charging for abstractions for bottled water, or indeed for other purposes.</p>  <p>  However, the Water Framework Directive requires that abstractions of surface water or groundwater which are likely to have a significant effect on water status must be regulated.  My Department has been examining how best to address this requirement in a proportionate and efficient way.  After approval in 2018 of a General Scheme of a Water Environment (Abstractions) Bill which would introduce a control and registration system over the abstraction of water, my Department undertook a public consultation, which resulted in 28 submissions.</p>  <p>  Following examination of those submissions and refinement of the policy approach, I will be returning to Government shortly with a revised General Scheme to give effect to our obligations under the Directive and to introduce a licensing and control system over the abstraction of water generally. </p>  <p>  In advance of the primary legislation, and in order to build up a nationwide picture of abstractions, a requirement to register water abstractions in excess of 25 cubic metres per day with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already been introduced by way of secondary legislation under the European Union (Water Policy) (Abstractions Registration) Regulations 2018. This has been put in place to enable the EPA to assess where particular water pressures as a result of abstraction might exist and, accordingly, better manage abstractions in areas of high risk in the future.  The register is maintained by the EPA and I understand that it does not provide for the specific identification of abstractions for the purposes of bottled water.</p>  <p>  There will be further opportunity to contribute to development of the provisions to be contained in the planned legislation when I submit the revised General Scheme of the Water Environment (Abstractions) Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  I expect that a proportionate abstraction control regime will effectively manage abstraction risks and pressures without imposing an unnecessary regulatory burden.  Recognising the relatively low abstraction pressures in Ireland, the proposed regime will focus on the most significant volumes and pressures.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that requirements in relation to the standards of bottled waters are laid out in the European Union (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2016, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

The HDO has worked with all key stakeholders involved in the delivery of housing, including from key disciplines such as architecture, planning, engineering and building control, project and construction management, quantity surveying, capital programme delivery and administration.  </p>  <p>  In the context of the increased delivery ambition in terms of social and affordable homes, my Department has been working with the City and County Management Association (CCMA) in terms of reviewing the most effective future operating platform for the HDO. While the Department has a pivotal role in terms of policy, legislation and the finance to enable local authorities deliver, the day to day delivery is a matter for local government and, with increased targets and delivery accelerating, the clear demand for an enhanced support structure is recognised.</p>  <p>  The CCMA recently submitted a proposal to my Department setting out the benefits that a revamped and reconfigured HDO more closely situated within the local government sector could have in terms of supporting increased delivery. This approach could have significant benefits in terms of addressing a number of delivery challenges including: </p>  <p>  - Leasing;</p>  <p>  - Social Housing Specification and Design;</p>  <p>  - Procurement/ Contract Management/ Project Management; and</p>  <p>  - Utilising Landbanks/ Achieving Mixed Tenure.</p>  <p>  Given the similarities between these objectives and other established Project Management Offices, I have agreed with the CCMA that the HDO will therefore transition to the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA). The CCMA and LGMA are working to a Quarter 1 2020 initiation of the new office.  We are fully agreed that the new unit will work closely, not only with my Department, but also with other key sectoral stakeholders, including the Land Development Agency and the Housing Agency, to align activity, share knowledge and expertise and drive efficiencies in the housing delivery process.</p></reply>

To address this, the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure.

Since the count date, the Housing Agency have been examining the figures submitted by Local Authorities. The Agency recently submitted their report to me which provides information on the characteristics of the households on the list. The full report, including breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The final numbers provided by the Housing Agency regarding the 2019 assessment show that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the last assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.</p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists. Local authorities have provided 90,000 social housing supports in the period of Rebuilding Ireland to date.</p><p>The undertaking of the SSHA assists in providing a more strategic picture of the dynamics of the numbers applying for social housing supports and emerging trends. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. The data garnered through the Summary will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.</p></reply>

However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements, which underpin RAS, as a form of social housing support. Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on main housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.</p>  <p>  Recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued from the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. The arrangement effectively allowed these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  All tenants allocated RAS accommodation post 1st April 2011 (and thus under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009) were informed at the time of offer and allocation that because RAS is now a social housing support, their housing need is met and that they will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.</p>  <p>  However, it is recommended that allocation schemes also provide a &lsquo;transfer pathway&rsquo; for new RAS tenants, whereby households in RAS have access to the transfer list in the same way as tenants in local authority accommodation.</p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p>  <p>  HAP and RAS continue to be key vehicles in meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </p></reply>

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the 2000 Act as amended and is a reserved function of the elected members.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions.  </p>  <p>  Circular PD 1/08 updates the earlier policy guidance issued by the Department and replaced circular letters PD 1/06 and 5/06 which directed planning authorities to develop a policy on taking in charge. All planning authorities were required to develop or update, as appropriate, their policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 on the basis of the framework set out in Circular PD 1/08.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in section 180.    </p>  <p>  I have no current plans to conduct a review of the taking-in-charge provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

The proposed reforms largely emanate from a steering group established by the Department of An Taoiseach on Data Centres and Judicial Review and an associated multi-Departmental and Agency working group mandated by that Group, which was chaired by my Department. </p>  <p>  The proposals in the General Scheme are not intended to inhibit actions by any person  directly impacted by a proposed development who has participated in the planning process.  Prior participation can be waived subject to certain reasonable exclusions. With regard to NGOs, the proposals are to ensure that there is clarity on the standing of NGOs in the process and to ensure that NGO provisions do not result in judicial review challenges being brought forward by bodies or organisations engaged in competitive or economic activity. The proposed cost capping measures are designed to provide a reasonable and proportionate balance in relation to the costs exposure for all parties and also enable the Courts to determine if a case is prohibitively expensive.</p>  <p>  I recently launched a public consultation on the General Scheme of the Bill.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p>  <p>  The elected members of local authorities have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, including adopting the annual budget. Setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is a key part of the budgetary process.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for rates harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of former town councils and county councils.  The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, provided an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, local authorities began the process of harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of former town councils and of county councils. Changes in rates liability, due to harmonisation, are being phased in over a period of up to 10 years.  An adjustment mechanism is provided to phase in increases and decreases to be known as the Base Year Adjustment (BYA).  The adoption of the ARV and BYA in respect of each financial year are reserved functions of local authority members.</p>  <p>  Three local authorities have yet to complete the rates harmonisation process, including Louth County Council.  It is expected that the remaining authorities will make progressive steps over the next budgetary periods to complete the harmonisation process within the legislative requirements. In that context, the specific timeframe for the completion of the process is a matter for each local authority and the issue of a meeting with the Council on this matter does not arise.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises with local authorities on financial matters and with the sector generally on an ongoing basis, while at all times respecting the mandate of elected representatives to carry out their reserved functions.</p></reply>

It is estimated that this site can accommodate 484 homes in a high quality mixed-tenure development. It is envisaged that 375 homes will be cost rental, with the remaining homes reserved for social housing. Taken together with an adjacent development of integrated social housing for older people, the overall tenure mix for the area will be 30% social and 70% cost rental.</p>  <p>  The homes at Emmet Road will be complemented by commercial, retail, community and open space, including the existing Inchicore Community Sports Centre. To facilitate community engagement, Dublin City Council has established the Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum, bringing together local residents, business owners, and civil society organisations. It is envisaged that the development will form a central element in the longer term economic and social regeneration of the Inchicore and Kilmainham areas.</p>  <p>  Based on the agreed tenure mix, it is anticipated that the funding for the 30% social housing units will be provided by my Department through existing funding programmes. The 70% of homes that will be available for cost rental will be funded through borrowing, and officials from Dublin City Council and my Department have recently met with the EIB who have reiterated their interest in being involved in supporting this cost rental pilot.</p>  <p>  Cost rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the homes only. It is not designed to replace traditional social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for the Government. Cost rental is a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is pursuing to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and ultimately provide more affordable housing.</p>  <p>  While noting that the financial modelling for projects of this level is heavily influenced by the base case assumptions made, it is my understanding that initial projections by advisers engaged by Dublin City Council have estimated that rents of up to approximately 40% below market rates are achievable.</p>  <p>  In order for this project to succeed as a cost rental development, it is important that project funds are recouped on an ongoing basis. As the rent paid by a household in a cost rental tenancy simply reflects the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the property, a number of measures can be used at the outset of a development in order to make rents more affordable. In the case of St Michael's, this includes the provision of land; the design of housing with value engineering and long term maintenance in mind; a potential State contribution to development costs via the Serviced Sites Fund, and the availability of low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over a long period of time.</p>  <p>  In relation to current progress on this project, a Development Framework Plan has been completed on behalf of Dublin City Council. Cost consultants have also completed a report on the construction costs of the plan and assessed the scheme in light of the objective to develop a pilot Cost Rental scheme. The Council is in the process of developing a Stage 1 Capital Works Management Framework application for the social housing element of the development and will submit this to my Department. The Council is also procuring an architect-led integrated design team, who will be responsible for designing the development and taking it as far as the planning stage. Tenders are due before year end and it is envisaged that the design team will be appointed in January 2020.</p></reply>

The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP-related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 -3 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord.  The HAP application form comes in two parts; Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. </p>  <p>  HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP Shared Service Centre.  If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.   The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>  An analysis of data from the HAP SSC indicates that the average processing time at the end of Q3 2019 within the 31 local authorities is 34 days. My Department has recently written to all local authorities to remind them of the critical need to keep processing times under review at a local level to ensure times are minimised to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  To support local authorities in the implementation of the HAP scheme, my Department provides a once off administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household to all local authorities.  This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process.  The payment is made directly to local authorities, to offset HAP staffing and administrative costs.  Since 2015 over &euro;9m has been provided to local authorities in this regard. </p>  <p>  At the end of Q3 2019, there were over 50,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 29,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that a draft General Scheme will be available by the end of the second quarter in 2020.</p><p>The proposal from the Interdepartmental Group was developed having regard to submissions received during a public consultation held in the autumn of 2018 and the holding of an open policy forum on the regulation of transparency of online political advertising which was held on 6 December 2018.  The two reports from the Interdepartmental Group, the submissions from the public consultation and a report on the forum's deliberations are available at the following link:</p><p>In summary, the proposal, as set out in the Interdepartmental Group&rsquo;s most recent progress report (November 2019), provides that the legislation will apply to online platforms, as sellers or intermediaries of political advertising, and to the buyers of political adverts.  It is envisaged that an obligation will be placed on sellers to determine that adverts fall under the scope of the legislation.  Online paid-for political advertisements commissioned for use during electoral periods will be required to be labelled as such and clearly display specified information, or a link to that information, in a transparent and conspicuous manner.</p></reply>

Our discussions focussed on the political situation in Northern Ireland and on a time frame for post-election talks.  I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe that there is a real potential window of opportunity very shortly to reach agreement between the parties on the restoration of the Good Friday Agreement Institutions. </p>  <p>  As I reported to the House on 27 November, I last met DUP leader Arlene Foster at the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies in Enniskillen on Sunday, 10 November, when we both participated in the laying of wreaths at the cenotaph and attended a remembrance service in St. Macartin's Cathedral. </p>  <p>  I spoke to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood by phone on 9th December 2019, when we discussed Brexit, the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive and the influence of Irish MPs in Westminster.  I also recently met with Claire Hanna of the SDLP in Government Buildings. </p>  <p>  In November, I wrote to the new UUP Leader Steve Aiken to congratulate him on his appointment as party leader.  </p>  <p>  I have not been in contact with the Alliance Party in recent weeks, although I spoke by phone with Naomi Long Alliance Party leader, on 8 October.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is in regular contact with all the Northern Party Leaders and keeps me fully briefed on developments.  There are also ongoing contacts at official level. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have confirmed that the two Governments are ready to take talks in Northern Ireland forward again immediately following the UK general election. </p>  <p>  We believe finding final agreement on the issues outstanding in these talks can be done in a short period of time.  A substantial talks process has already taken place during the period 2017 through 2019.  Notwithstanding this, a successful outcome in the weeks ahead will require political will and leadership by the parties.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the restoration and effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

This is the most recent iteration of the draft proposal by successive Presidencies in these complex negotiations, which are likely to continue well into 2020. The Presidency has proposed an overall level of 1.07% of EU27 GNI for the next MFF period 2021-2027 and has maintained or slightly increased the allocations for Cohesion and CAP, which are priority areas for Ireland. To maintain CAP and Cohesion spending at the level proposed by the Commission, the Presidency has proposed adjustments to a range of other programmes, including in the defence area. I am pleased that the revised proposal confirms that at least 25% of the EU budget should be devoted to climate action. The MFF negotiations feature regularly on the agenda of my bilateral meetings with EU counterparts so that we can explain and understand our respective priorities. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-11a.175.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121100071#WRD04300"><p>Full and effective implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements, including the 2006 St Andrews Agreement, the 2014 Stormont House Agreement and the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement, is a key priority for the Government, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  Progress in implementing the provisions of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements and outstanding commitments from earlier Agreements are to be considered at Review Meetings, co-convened by the two Governments with the participation of the Executive. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the Executive since early 2017, it has not been possible to convene a Review Meeting since December 2016. Nevertheless, work on implementation has continued as appropriate in each jurisdiction, and to the extent possible in the absence of the Executive.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism. On 13 September 2016, the Irish and UK Governments signed an international agreement to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) and it was subsequently given effect to by legislation in both jurisdictions. The IRC reports annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland, and it published its second report on 4 November. This second IRC report is a sobering reminder of the continuing adverse impact that paramilitarism continues to have on society in Northern Ireland and brings an important and timely focus on what remains to be done to tackle it. The IRC has been active in pursuing its remit and has had a wide engagement with a range of relevant stakeholders, both North and South, and I commend the Commission for its valuable work so far and the efforts it has put into fulfilling its mandate. </p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement also provided for the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime. That Task Force was launched in Dublin in December 2015, and is bringing forward operational actions in the six priority areas that have been agreed as the focus of operations: Rural Crime; Immigration-related Crime; Excise Fraud; Drugs; Financial Crime; and Human Trafficking. These priorities are, of course, kept under review. There has been very considerable operational activity, with a variety of different operations undertaken across all of the priority areas since the establishment of the Task Force. The Joint Agency Task Force is an important example of the extensive and vital North-South co-operation that is undertaken between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies in both jurisdictions aimed at tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on this island.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement affirmed the parties&rsquo; commitment to implementation of the Stormont House Agreement provisions for dealing with the past. Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with all of the political parties to support a way forward to implement the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework. The Government remains firmly committed to the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework, and will continue to engage with the next British Government to see this finally achieved.</p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Government made a number of financial commitments in support of the agreement, including &euro;75m in respect of the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland, exploring the development of the Ulster Canal and the Narrow Water Bridge, and funding of &euro;2.5m to support the North West Development Fund. The latter commitment has been provided and the others are being progressed, overseen by a group of senior officials from the Government and the Executive as provided for under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  A number of elements of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreements have not yet been fully implemented, and the Government also continues to work to see this achieved. This includes the provision in the St Andrews Agreement in 2006 for an Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland to be enacted by the British Government. Regrettably to date, there has been no agreement within the Executive to take forward what is now a devolved matter. In the successive discussions at Stormont that have been held since March 2017 to support the formation of a new Executive, the Government made consistently our support for an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.</p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland throughout these talks processes to encourage the parties to reach an accommodation. The multi-party inclusive talks process convened by the two Governments in May has included a specific working group to seek to reach agreement on rights, language and identity issues, which have proved intractable to date.</p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process over the last number of months and progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith on how the two Governments can support the parties in reaching an agreement that will get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have confirmed that the two Governments are ready to take talks in Northern Ireland forward again immediately following the UK general election. It is envisaged that talks will commence as soon as possible after the UK election, potentially on 16 December. This of course depends to some extent on the outcome of the UK election.</p>  <p>  People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and address issues of concern in Northern Ireland at present, including the implementation on an agreed basis of commitments from previous Agreements. The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions and the full and effective implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements.</p></reply>

In this role, Deputy Deasy reports directly to the Department of An Taoiseach on the outcomes of his visits. He is supported, however, from a logistical perspective, by my staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, Deputy Deasy has made 18 trips to the US in connection with his role as Special Envoy to the US Congress: four in 2017, ten in 2018 and four so far in 2019. He will again travel to Washington, D.C. the week beginning 9 December. </p>  <p>  Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s travel and subsistence expenses are covered from within the existing resources of my Department, as and when he undertakes activities in connection with his role as Special Envoy. The total costs for Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s flights, accommodation and subsistence in 2017 were &euro;13,784.25. The cost in 2018 was &euro;30,295.90 and the cost, to date, in 2019 has been &euro;10,729.76. Therefore the total costs incurred by Deputy Deasy to date in connection with his role as Special Envoy amount to &euro; 54,809.91. This includes supporting some engagements with high level US contacts that have visited Ireland.</p>  <p>  The focus of Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s engagements in the US has been advocating on behalf of the Government and informing high-level US officials and politicians on the Government&rsquo;s dual priority for seeking legal pathways for Irish immigration, such as through E3 visas, and on relief for the undocumented Irish. In this regard, Deputy Deasy meets with key contacts in the US Administration as well as political leaders in the House of Representatives and Senate. These meetings are therefore primarily in Washington D.C.</p></reply>

The programme was launched by the Taoiseach and myself and Ministers Humphreys, Madigan and McEntee in June 2018 and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions in relation to how we trade, the bilateral and multilateral partnerships that we seek to build and our wider contribution to the world.</p><p>Global Ireland: Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada 2019&ndash;2025 is Ireland's first whole-of-Government strategy for the US and Canada. Its aim is for Ireland to build strong, strategic political partnerships with the US and Canada and assume a lead role in building stronger transatlantic relations. </p><p>To coincide with the programme of St. Patrick &rsquo;s Day-related activities held there earlier this year, my Department incurred a small amount of expenditure in relation to the production and online promotion of a video which outlined the Strategy&rsquo;s key objectives insofar as the US is concerned.  </p><p>In July, to mark the 1st anniversary of the launch of Global Ireland programme, my Department held the Global Ireland Summit in Dublin Castle.  At the Summit it was announced that Ireland plans to double its impact in the Asia Pacific region, as part of the next phase of Global Ireland 2025. The Taoiseach and I, as well asGovernment Ministers, Ambassadors and key stakeholders addressed the Summit.  To coincide with this event a video was produced and promoted via social media. </p><p><b>Common Travel Area  - &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; </b></p><p>Irish and British citizens will still be able to move freely, live and work between the two countries. This video was shared across social media and Ireland, the UK and the EU all agree that the Common Travel Area will continue in all circumstances.<b></b></p><p><b>2019 Rugby World Cup</b></p><p>In 2019 the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade coordinated a multi-agency promotional campaign to promote Ireland as a great place to invest, study, trade with, and visit during the Japan Rugby World Cup. This collaborative Team Ireland promotional campaign was a digital-led effort in the Japanese language to raise the visibility of Ireland amongst a Japanese audience at the Rugby World Cup and to win business for Ireland.</p><p>Japan is the third-largest economy in the world. It is Ireland&rsquo;s 11<sup>th</sup>largest trading partner, and is the largest source of foreign direct investment into Ireland from the Asia Pacific region. The Rugby World Cup presented a significant opportunity to increase awareness about Ireland and to build a positive reputation for Ireland in Japan.  This Global Ireland integrated Japanese language initiative successfully increased Ireland&rsquo;s reach in Japan and is supporting the development of a stronger economic partnership with Japan. The digital resources developed will continue to be drawn on by Team Ireland in its ongoing promotion efforts in the country.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Campaign detail </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Global Ireland: St Patrick's Day </td>       <td>&euro;18,526.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Global Ireland: Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada</td>       <td>&euro;  5,047.00 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Global Ireland Summit video</td>       <td>&euro;  8,579.25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Global Ireland: Rugby World Cup Ireland promotion video</td>       <td>&euro; 45,180.29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready, Common Travel Area video </td>       <td>&euro;12,238.50 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Contracting authorities may also reserve certain contracts for health, social and cultural services to organisations such as not-for-profit organisations which meet certain conditions, namely the pursuit of a public service mission linked to the delivery of the relevant services and reinvestment of profits in the organisation. </p>  <p>  The Procurement Directives also set out the reporting obligations applicable to any above threshold procurements that lie within the scope of the EU Directive on public procurement. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement activities are discharged in line with procurement rules and procedures which includes reporting.  The OGP supports contracting authorities in this regard by making them aware of their legal and policy obligations in respect to public procurement. </p>  <p>  The OGP has been promoting the inclusion of social considerations, including reserved contracts and sheltered workshops.  Last October, the OGP published Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement.   The circular was the latest development following publication of an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement last December and the establishment of the cross Departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group in March this year.  These developments promote and facilitate the inclusion of social considerations in a structured manner and are aimed at helping policy makers and procurement practitioners understand how procurement can be used to support advancement of existing social policy objectives, the wider context and the implications of including them in procurement projects. </p></reply>

Established in March, this cross-departmental group has met three times in 2019. Members are in the process of identifying pilot projects or appropriate social policy objectives in which social considerations can be advanced through the group. </p><p>To further support the incorporation of social considerations into public procurement, my Department published in October, <i>Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement</i>. The circular highlights the possibilities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement including in relation to employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access, promoting social inclusion and social enterprises.</p><p>To help policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects, the OGP published an information note on incorporating social considerations into public procurement last December which is available on ogp.gov.ie.</p><p>In addition to the work of the Social Considerations Advisory Group, officials from the OGP have also engaged in bilateral meetings with Government Departments to promote the inclusion of social considerations in public procurement.  </p><p>It is worth nothing that OGP cannot decide for other contracting authorities, or at a whole-of-Government level, what social considerations should be included in the frameworks and contracts that it puts in place on their behalf.  The OGP requires guidance from policy departments (and Government approval as appropriate) as well as the agreement of individual contracting authorities who are responsible for managing their own contracts and the associated costs. The appropriateness of including social considerations needs to be examined on a contract-by-contract basis and there needs to be sufficient flexibility to allow each individual contracting authority to decide what, how, and when social considerations can be used. The OGP can help facilitate the process of incorporating those objectives, once agreed, into planned procurement projects.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in relation to the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, and can confirm that the school&rsquo;s NEPS psychologists has been consulting with his parents and the school in relation to the concerns raised in his regard. A meeting with the parents took place in this regard on 5th November last and another is scheduled for today.  However the child has been referred to the School Age Team for a full diagnostic assessment which is required to underpin an application for an SNA. The School Age Team, as you will be aware, falls under the HSE and the question as to an assessment appointment is one for my colleague the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  I can, in the interim, assure you of the continuing input of the NEPS service to the child, his parents and school in relation to his ongoing maintenance and support in school.</p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021.   </p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that this year's capital allocation of &euro;10 million for the Garda fleet is  being used for purchase and fit-out of over 300 new vehicles for operational use this year.

The proposed updating follows on from the review work undertaken in my Department and from the consultations held with interested stakeholders. The Government also approved the concept of the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body operating under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  The proposals in the General Scheme were reviewed by the Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling. The Group's Report was approved and published by the Government on 20 March 2019. The Report contained a number of significant recommendations concerning all aspects of gambling activity. In particular, it recommended that future responsibility for licensing and regulation of all forms of gambling, including online gambling, rest with a proposed new gambling regulatory authority. </p>  <p>  I hosted a major seminar on the future licensing and regulation of gambling at Farmleigh House on 15 May 2019, bringing together a large number of interested and concerned stakeholders to discuss the Report of the Working Group and further developments.</p>  <p>  Work on revising the revised General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill is underway in my Department. This is a complex area and we must be certain that any reforms will be achievable and effective. At the time of publication of the Working Group Report, An Taoiseach indicated that work on revising legislation, taking account of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, would likely take a period of about 18 months to bring to completion.</p>  <p>  Separately, I have brought forward the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019, an interim reform measure to amend the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act. Report and Final Stages of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad today. This is the final Oireachtas Stage. I hope to complete the enactment of the Bill swiftly thereafter. </p></reply>

The 'No Excuses' campaign is a high impact media campaign designed to reach a national audience featuring TV, cinema, radio, outdoor, social and digital advertising. The &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; campaign was preceded by the domestic violence awareness campaign &lsquo;What Would You Do?&rsquo; which ran for three years from 2016 to 2018.</p>  <p>  The current total cost of the &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; campaign in 2019 is &euro;1,120,459, which includes &euro;170,915 from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;950,000 has been secured to run the campaign in 2020. In addition, funding of &euro;300,000 has been awarded under the Dormant Accounts Fund to localise the campaign message. It is intended, subject to the necessary funding being made available, that the campaign will continue up to 2021.</p>  <p>  Two newspaper adverts also ran 7 &ndash; 8 December 2019 to highlight the application process for funding for the provision of services supporting victims in the criminal justice system. The cost of this was &euro;2,280.</p>  <p>  The use of digital marketing allows the Department to reach audiences that might not be as likely to see or hear traditional forms of marketing such as newspapers, television and radio, and draws greater attention to matters such as domestic violence and human trafficking. </p>  <p>  My Department runs an annual Fireworks Awareness Campaign in the run up to Hallowe'en. The total cost of this campaign is &euro;12,491. As traditional print media advertising can fail to reach important target audiences, in particular those under 21, spend was evenly split between print and social media.</p>  <p>  In respect of video content, the Press and Communications Office of my Department has been developing its capacity to develop and disseminate such video and digital media content internally since 2016. External videography services are only used exceptionally as in the case of larger campaigns such as &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; and are procured in line with public procurement guidelines set out by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). There are currently no plans to outsource further video productions for 2020.</p></reply>

The scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities.  The application of a quota-based system is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets and to invest in innovative technologies for the sector. To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful and a total of 500 permits has been made available to the Horticulture sector; 150 to Dairy Farm Assistants and 1,500 permits for Meat Processing Operatives. In addition, from July 2019, a further quota of 300 permits for Meat Deboners were made available. </p>  <p>  The quota for horticulture workers is almost exhausted and before consideration can be given to extending the quota, the sector needs to submit a business case clearly demonstrating  that the recruitment difficulties are shortages across the EEA not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions. The sector also needs to detail the strategies in place for training/upskilling/career development within the industry and show that it is engaging systematically with the employment services of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  </p>  <p>  The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are an important part of the decision-making process.

The WRC assumes the roles and functions previously carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), Equality Tribunal (ET), Labour Relations Commission (LRC), and the first-instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT). </p><p>As the WRC was established late in the fiscal year of 2015, the budgets of the individual workplace relations bodies remained unchanged until the following year. The pay/non-pay budget allocations of the individual workplace relations bodies which were amalgamated to form the WRC in 2015, were as follows: </p><p>Table 1:</p><p>Pay and non-pay budget allocation for Workplace Relations Bodies 2015: <table>    <tr>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>Non- pay  &euro;000 </th>       <th>Pay   &euro;000</th>       <th>Total  &euro;000</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Employment Rights   Authority (NERA)</td>       <td>862</td>       <td>5,183</td>       <td>6,045</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Labour Relations Commission   (LRC)</td>       <td>814</td>       <td>4,130</td>       <td>4,944</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Employment Appeals Tribunal   (EAT)</td>       <td>422</td>       <td>2,960</td>       <td>3,382</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Equality Tribunal (ET)</td>       <td>239</td>       <td>1,460</td>       <td>1,699</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2: </p><p>WRC budget allocation for pay and non-pay in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Workplace   Relations   Commission (WRC)</th>       <th>Non- pay  &euro;000</th>       <th>Pay   &euro;000</th>       <th>Total   &euro;000</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>2,489</td>       <td>10,081</td>       <td>12,570</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>2,314</td>       <td>11,065</td>       <td>13,379</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2,314</td>       <td>11,700</td>       <td>14,014</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,614</td>       <td>12,340</td>       <td>14,954</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2,614</td>       <td>12,340</td>       <td>14,954</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The WRC&rsquo;s Inspection and Enforcement Division carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislations.

The growth in demand for shopping online domestically and globally is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness. Retailing supports jobs in every city, town and village in the country, with one in every seven people at work in the retail sector. Therefore, it is critical that our retail sector is both productive and competitive to sustain employment across the country, in the long term. </p>  <p>  Technological breakthroughs, as one of the global megatrends, has greatly affected retailing. The pace and progress of technological change has never been greater, and it is clear that this transformation &ndash; although exciting, is challenging for the sector.  The digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond. Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, domestically and internationally, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.  Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. </p>  <p>  I want Irish based retailers to compete at the forefront of the digital revolution and have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability, in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness. To enable retailers to increase their customer base and build a more resilient business, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme in 2018 administered by Enterprise Ireland. The Scheme, with a fund of up to &euro;1.25m over two Calls, provided funding to 40 retailers across Ireland, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis.

The HSE has also begun the development of a Programme for Women's Health in Epilepsy, which will coordinate the national response to issues relating to sodium valproate.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE intends to publish its report in the near future.    </p></reply>

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access.</p><p>Regulations governing the current pharmacy fee structure were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and are set to expire at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations must be replaced on 1<sup>st</sup>January 2020 to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p><p>In keeping with my obligations under Section 43 of the 2017 Act, my officials have undertaken a process of consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), as the representative body for the profession. My officials have met with an IPU delegation on two occasions where proposed fee restructuring was discussed. A detailed submission was received from the IPU. This consultation process has now concluded. </p><p>I met with the IPU on the 5<sup>th</sup>December, where I reiterated my intention to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the FEMPI regulations and to commence a comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract. In this context I also communicated my intention to maintain the current fee structure from 1 January 2020. </p><p>The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract in 2020 will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money.</p><p>However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes. Accordingly, any measures to be considered must be evidence based.</p><p>New secondary legislation is currently being drafted in order to give effect to the prescribed fee structure, as required under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.</p></reply>

The Department recently published the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling. The report considered the social impact of gambling and the protection of vulnerable persons. The  Group recommended that a Social Fund should be established to fund research on problem gambling.</p>  <p>  The report notes that the 2014/15 Drug Prevalence Survey provides the first comprehensive set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland, as the final achieved sample comprised of 7,005 respondents. The results indicate that 64.5% of the population report some form of gambling in the 12 months prior to the survey, with 41.4% gambling on a monthly basis, or more often. The survey further found that prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%. </p>  <p>  The survey is being repeated for 2018/2019 under the auspices of the Health Research Board (HRB) with initial findings expected to be published in 2020. </p>  <p>  The regulation of gambling is the responsibility of my colleague, Minister David Stanton, in the Department of Justice and Equality.

A patient with a cataract is advised to have it removed when it significantly impacts on their activities of daily living and this can vary from patient to patient. Once a patient&rsquo;s vision drops to below 6/12 in the better eye, they are advised to have the cataract removed if they wish to continue driving. </p><p>The attached table provides a breakdown of the number of people awaiting cataract surgery by time band nationally by hospital at the end of October 2019. </p></reply>

As such, this project is encompassed within Project Ireland 2040, as well as the HSE Capital Plan 2019-2021.</p><p>My Department continues to engage with the NMH and St Vincent's Healthcare Group (SVHG) to develop a legal framework to protect the State&rsquo;s significant investment in the new hospital. SVHG has agreed to provide the State with a 99-year lease of the land upon which the new maternity hospital will be built, and this will allow the State to retain ownership of the new facility. The State will, in turn, provide an Operating Licence to the NMH DAC and SVHG to enable the provision of health services in the newly constructed building. </p><p>Construction work commenced on site earlier this year on the new pharmacy and the car park extension and these works will be completed in 2020.  However, the tender documents for the construction of the new maternity hospital will not issue until such time as the legal framework is agreed.</p><p>The governance arrangements for the new NMH will be based on the provisions of the Mulvey Agreement.  That Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC</i>- which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. The Agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the new hospital without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  </p><p>While my Department has not had any engagement with the Religious Sisters of Charity or the Vatican, at a recent meeting the Chair of SVHG provided an update to my Department in relation to the transfer, by the Religious Sisters of Charity, of their shareholding in SVHG.

In that context I have asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review which will examine the evidence in relation to the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether there is evidence that they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco cigarettes. The evidence review is expected to be completed in April 2020.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year. For the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients over the age of 75 attending hospital EDs increased by 3.3% compared to the same period last year. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group.</p>  <p>  However, the National Service Plan 2019 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department are discharged or admitted within 24 hours and any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  There are a number of factors which may affect the waiting times for older patients. In particular, people in the older age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and be admitted then the population generally. Consequently, a higher number of these patients may have to be accommodated on trolleys, pending their admission to a ward. There are also issues around delayed discharges of care which can cause congestion within hospital emergency departments.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.</p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.</p>  <p>On 14 November 2019, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product siponimod (Mayzent), intended for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease. The EMA's decision on whether to grant marketing authorisation for siponimod will take into account CHMP's recommendation.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines.

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.</p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally. This winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme, and will provide additional home support and transitional care to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

The Taskforce has been established for a two year period and is meeting regularly, there have been three full meetings to date in September, October and December.  </p>  <p>  The Taskforce is at an early stage of its work and is considering the full range of issues affecting women&rsquo;s health in Ireland. The Taskforce will tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland and will work on these on a phased, prioritised basis. Priorities will be decided by the Taskforce in consultation with stakeholders including the public.</p>  <p>  Early public feedback has raised a number of issues of importance to women, including &lsquo;the need to feel heard&rsquo; and Taskforce members are committed to keeping women&rsquo;s voices at the centre of their work. </p>  <p>  The first action of the Taskforce is to lead a 'radical listening' exercise inviting women in Ireland to share their experiences of and solutions for the health system. This will commence in early 2020 and all women will be encouraged to provide their perspectives. This process will also target a number of different groups with unique perspectives. I intend that women who were adopted will be included in this process and I hope they take the opportunity to participate. </p>  <p>  There will be multiple additional opportunities for anyone interested to feed into the work of the Taskforce and I would encourage them to do so.  The work of the Taskforce, as well as opportunities to engage, can be tracked on the Taskforce's webpage. </p>  <p>  Information and data gathered through engagement with stakeholders, combined with the other available evidence will form the basis for future policy and action to improve women's health in Ireland.  </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed on 19 November with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p>  <p>  Work has already begun and a deployment plan will be made available by NBI shortly. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  Approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs), including schools, library hubs and local sports halls in every county in Ireland, will be connected to high speed broadband during 2020, to enable communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband. The BCP locations are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2021, NBI plans to pass approximately 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. NBI has indicated that the network rollout will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. </p>  <p>  With regard to the fibre installation close to the premises referred to by the Deputy, eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and not part of the planned State Intervention network.

As part of this review I have already sought the input from the State energy organisations on the challenges involved. The technical analysis for the review will be conducted by independent consultants to be commissioned following a public procurement exercise. The full terms of reference for this technical analysis of energy security and sustainability are being finalised. As I recently advised the House, I expect the terms of reference will be finalised in early 2020; a public consultation process may form part of the review process.</p>  <p>  The review into Ireland's energy security and sustainability will:</p>  <p>  -  Consider the optimal actions that need to be taken, in reaching 70% renewable electricity, to ensure Ireland's electricity system is backed up in a secure, safe and sustainable way. </p>  <p>  -  Assess the role of gas during the transition, as the lowest CO2 emitting fossil fuel, and consider how and from where it is sourced. </p>  <p>  -  Review the role that other technologies can play in the transition, including battery storage, pumped storage, the role of interconnection (both gas and electricity) and the possibilities for hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). </p>  <p>  -  Consider what the roadmap for renewable electricity looks like in the period from 2030 to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding any conflict of interest by State Bodies, the normal process of policy development and formulation is through engagement with stakeholders, which includes State Agencies and Bodies having statutory responsibility in relation to energy security. In relation to any investments in energy projects by State bodies under the aegis of my Department that may materialise as a result of the review, these will be evaluated, where Ministerial consent is required, in the context of Government policy, including from security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability perspectives. </p>  <p>  In relation to energy efficiency, it is universally accepted that the first step towards security of supply and reduced emissions is to reduce the amount of energy used. Actions set out in the Climate Action Plan, which I launched in July, include the energy efficiency of buildings, including the upgrading of 500,000 homes to B2 rating, the delivery of efficient district heating systems, and the reduction in car journeys through better planning, better public transport and promoting home working, all of which are directed towards the efficient use of energy. The Plan also provides for 70% electricity from renewable sources, for 400,000 heat pumps, and for 950,000 electric vehicles by 2030. </p>  <p>  The review will have regard to the Climate Action Plan and other relevant information. The outcome of the review will feed into the formulation of future policy on the security and sustainability of our energy systems and structures. </p></reply>

It has, as outlined in its published Statement of Strategy, prioritised communicating with the general public in relation to the range of supports available to assist communities and those in rural Ireland. </p><p>For example, my Department administers the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, a &euro;1 billion investment by government in rural Ireland over the period 2019 to 2027. We are also delivering schemes such as the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme (&euro;250 million) and Community Development Programmes, to which my Department will allocate &euro;158 million in 2020 alone. </p><p>In order to better inform rural communities about the supports available, my Department led and delivered the Rural Opportunity roadshow and campaign from March to May this year.

In addition to the living alone increase my Department pays out a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash on a weekly, monthly or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The living alone increase is currently an additional payment of &euro;9, and it is not a payment in its own right, but rather it is a supplement paid to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and are in receipt of Invalidity Pension, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension.  There are currently over 206,000 recipients of the living alone increase, with circa 167,000 of these in receipt of a state pension payment. </p>  <p>  The rate of primary and secondary payments to pensioners, and their adequacy, are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.  In so doing, the Government considers evidence from a wide range of sources, including agencies such as the CSO, and also research submitted by advocacy groups such as the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  I am committed to reducing the risk of poverty of marginalised groups, particularly those who live alone.  People living alone can be more vulnerable to economic deprivation than two-person households where resources can be pooled.</p>  <p>  To this end, the increase for living alone was increased in Budget 2020 from &euro;9 to &euro;14 per week.  This increase will be paid to pensioners from January 6th 2020.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2007, Minister Cullen launched the Green Paper on Pensions, which proposed raising the Pension Age.  This was followed by a major public consultation exercise. Three years later, in 2010, Minister Hanafin launched the National Pensions Framework which, following a Government decision, set out the agenda of changes in the State Pension Age in 2014, 2021 and 2028.  This strategy was enacted via legislation introduced by then Minister Burton and passed in 2011 which provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.  This is in keeping with similar measures introduced by most EU and OECD countries.</p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people) or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the gross cost to the State Pension (Contributory) of postponing the increase in State Pension Age would be approximately &euro;430m per annum, with a net cost of around &euro;217.5 million per annum.  These estimates factor in secondary costs such as foregone PRSI receipts and additional Household Benefit payments.  Therefore, if the age changes legislated for in 2021 and 2028 were both reversed, the current estimated net cost from 2028 would be c.&euro;435m per annum.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date, funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes.  Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The Government is committed to the introduction of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, households on?moderate?incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure.</p><p>Cost Rental homes may be provided by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, or other bodies as deemed appropriate. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, Cost Rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness.  Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that Cost Rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rental market.</p><p>It should be noted that Cost Rental is not designed to replace traditional social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for the Government. Cost Rental is a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is using to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and ultimately provide more affordable housing.</p><p>Although my Department is producing a national framework for Cost Rental, which will allow its implementation across the country, the initial pilots have been targeted at large urban centres. These areas have the highest rent levels, driven by increasing demand and present the most acute affordability issues for households. For this reason, my Department is currently supporting initial Cost Rental pilot projects at Emmet Road in Inchicore and Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter has already commenced construction, and is being delivered in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the Respond and Tuath Approved Housing Bodies; the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. </p><p>The selection of further sites for Cost Rental will be informed largely by the financial and operational model that will emerge from the evidence building currently underway.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, which contains a range of measures to support individuals and families experiencing homelessness. </p>  <p>  Under the legal and policy framework in place, local authorities are responsible for the provision of homeless services to households experiencing homelessness. Local authorities and their service delivery partners work with each household experiencing homelessness to identify and secure an appropriate home for that household.  My Department has increased the budget available to local authorities to deliver homeless services by over 25% to &euro;146m this year.  Next year, this funding will increase by &euro;20m to &euro;166m.  This increased funding will support increased numbers of households experiencing homelessness with the necessary supports to exit from homelessness to a home. </p>  <p>  In the first nine months of 2018, a total of 4,389 adults and their associated dependants exited from homelessness to an independent tenancy.  This is a 17% increase on the numbers recorded at the same point in 2018.  The exits for this period include: 873 exits to local authority owned properties, or up 69% on the corresponding period in 2018; 691 exits to Approved Housing Body (AHB) lettings or Long Term Supported Accommodation, up 46% on the corresponding period in 2018; and 2,825 exits to private rented properties up 2% on the corresponding period in 2018.</p>  <p>  In 2020, as we continue to increase housing output and, in particular increase the number of new social homes to 11,000, I expect to see increased exits from homelessness to all tenure types. </p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the last assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.</p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists. Local authorities have provided over 90,000 social housing supports in the period of Rebuilding Ireland to date.</p><p>The undertaking of the SSHA assists in providing a more strategic picture of the dynamics of the numbers applying for social housing supports and emerging trends. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. The data garnered through the Summary will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.</p><p>Qualified households on social housing waiting lists can have a wide variety of housing needs and it is therefore important that there is a blend of social housing delivery mechanisms available that can meet those diverse needs in the most effective manner.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, the aim is to meet the housing needs of some 138,000 households over the 6 year period 2016 to 2021, and provision is made for this to be achieved through a mix of different mechanisms.  These include build, acquisition and leasing schemes delivered by local authorities or in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). </p><p>Over the period of Rebuilding Ireland, 2016 to end Quarter 3 2019, over 90,000 additional households across the country had their housing needs met.  In 2018, just over 27,100 households were supported, 6% ahead of the overall target for the year.  We are targeting over 27,000 again this year and next.</p><p>In 2019 alone, 10,000 new social homes will be delivered utilising these methods, including 6,545 build homes delivered by Local Authorities nationwide, in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies. Looking to 2020 we expect to see 11,000 new social homes delivered showing the increased capacity now in the system to deliver homes for those who need them.</p><p>Earlier this year, I published the 2019 targets for social housing delivery broken down by local authority, and also broken into Build, Acquisition, Leasing, HAP and RAS. Each quarter, I publish progress against those targets, and this morning I published the Quarter 3 2019 outputs, showing 66% delivery to end September. This data is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>It is recognised that local authority building activity and the pace of such delivery must continue to increase. Against this background, additional resources, including technical resources, which during the inactive years had been lost to local authorities, continue to be replenished. Streamlined approval processes for capital projects have been put in place, including a revised single stage approval process. A range of supports have also been put in place including:</p><p>- Internal Layouts for Social Housing;</p><p>- Employers Requirements;</p><p>- Volumetric Frameworks; </p><p>- Rapid Framework</p><p>- Guidance Notes, including on Turnkey Delivery;</p><p>- Planning Reforms;</p><p>- Heights &amp;amp; Apartment Guidelines</p><p>- A newly restructured Housing Delivery Office is being advanced and work is ongoing between my Department and the LGMA in this regard. </p><p>The blend of delivery will vary across areas depending on local circumstances. However, my message to local authorities has been consistent and it is a message that every possible effort must be made to, at minimum, achieve our targets, if not exceed them.  The range of delivery schemes, funding and resources are in place to support this. I will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure that any impediments to progress are addressed.</p></reply>

This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources. I have no plans to raise these income limits at present.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a demand led scheme and when it was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years.  However, this loan product has proved to be more successful than initially anticipated. In the context of the scheme&rsquo;s success my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.</p>  <p>  I engaged early as I said I would. While discussions commenced in October 2018 on additional funding, the first tranche of &euro;200m was only fully drawn down in August of this year. My Department wrote to all 31 local authorities on 15 August 2019 sanctioning an additional &euro;363.6 million in funding for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This brings total funding for the Loan to over &euro;563.6 million for 2018 and 2019 combined. </p>  <p>  The overall allocations incorporate loans already issued since the inception of the scheme, loans which will be drawn down on foot of approvals already issued and projected loan demand for the rest of 2019. There are no requests for additional funding in 2019. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for social housing support and be placed on a housing list, an applicant must be assessed by the authority concerned as meeting all of the eligibility and need criteria set down in the legislation. </p>  <p>  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are set out in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA).  </p>  <p>  The most recently conducted SSHA details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as at 24 June 2019 (the count date). Since the count date, the Housing Agency has been examining the figures submitted by Local Authorities. The Agency recently submitted its report to me which provides information on the characteristics of the households on the list. The full report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The final numbers provided by the Housing Agency regarding the 2019 assessment show that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the last assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that social housing is a demand led service and for that reason it is difficult to predict the degree to which housing lists will decrease or increase over the next 12 months. The number of units delivered by local authorities in a given time period does not necessarily equate to the &lsquo;net need&rsquo; for social housing support reducing by an equivalent number. The nature of the list is dynamic.  As new households are added to it, others are removed as their housing needs are met or where the households themselves indicate that they no longer require State support. </p>  <p>  The undertaking of the SSHA assists in providing a more strategic picture of the dynamics of the numbers applying for social housing supports and emerging trends. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. The data garnered through the Summary will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.</p>  <p>  While it is difficult to predict social housing need, it is important that Housing Authorities are aware in general terms of the potential demand when they are preparing their Housing Strategies as part of their Development Plan process. To this end, National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework (NPF) requires that local authorities in the future will undertake a "Housing Need and Demand Assessment" (HNDA) for each local authority area. This will be important in estimating likely future housing need across tenures.  </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the HNDA process has commenced in my Department and an expert advisory group is preparing guidance for local authorities to assist them in conducting a HNDA. This new evidence-based approach will form the basis of a more accurate and consistent projection of demand for different tenures of housing. The HNDA methodology, which it is hoped will be available in early 2020, will comprise guidance and an assessment tool, that will inform local authority HNDA preparation.</p></reply>

Ultimately the most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors. At this point, affordability remains a significant issue in the rental market and the Government is tackling this in a number of different ways to help ensure that families can provide themselves with a home - whether that be in the rental market itself or via home purchase. </p>  <p>  Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Cost Rental relates to housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only as opposed to private sector rentals where rents are set by the market, which may lead to high rents in high demand areas. The rent paid by a household in a Cost Rental tenancy will not be driven by market demand. A core objective of Cost Rental is to offer moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that Cost Rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rental market. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, Cost Rental can make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector recognises that rapidly increasing rental inflation is the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector and that there is a need for a targeted, time-bound and transparent policy response to the issue of rising rents. To address this, the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure. This measure, which was provided for by the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, introduced the concept of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly. </p>  <p>  At this stage, some 68% of the approximate 311,000 tenancies in the private rental sector are covered by RPZ designations and come under the 4% rent increase restriction. </p>  <p>  In order to support more robust enforcement of the RPZ regime, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 has provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with additional powers and resources to carry out investigations and sanction landlords, if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in Rent Pressure Zones.</p>  <p>  The Government has also introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, was introduced with effect from 1 February 2018. The loan enables credit-worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home.</p>  <p>  The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and DIRT paid over the previous four tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  As of 30 November 2019, Revenue has received 34,760 applications, and a total of 16,550 HTB claims have been made, of which 15,903 are approved. The estimated total value of approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;236 million.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure, Pascal Donohoe TD, extended the initiative in its current form in Budget 2020. This means that the HTB initiative will remain for another two years until 31st December 2021.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of new homes at affordable prices is a key pillar of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Under Rebuilding Ireland the Government has introduced the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. The objective of the fund is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve infrastructure blockages, thereby enabling the accelerated delivery of housing in Dublin and in other urban areas in high demand. Funding of &euro;200m has been allocated across 30 projects over the period to 2021 and work is underway to deliver the infrastructure with an associated housing delivery of up to 20,000 units. About 40% of these homes will be sold at rates which provide a discount on market prices. More than 3,000 will be social units and the remainder will be sold at market rates.</p>  <p>  &euro;310m has been made available under the Serviced Sites Fund over the period to 2021 for infrastructure works on local authority lands that will support the delivery of housing for rent or purchase at rates which provide a significant discount on open market costs. Two calls for proposals have been made to date which has resulted in &lsquo;Approval in Principle&rsquo; being given for an allocation of c. &euro;127m in funding to 35 projects and c. 3,200 more affordable homes. It is anticipated that a further call for proposals will issue in 2020.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the affordability provisions set out in Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 came into force. Regulations in relation to a number of operational matters (including schemes of priority) were made earlier this year and further Regulations will be made in the coming months. Under affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, a maximum discount of 40% of the market price will be given. However, unlike previous affordable schemes, the percentage discount provided will remain a Local Authority equity charge until it is repaid.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, my Department has been working closely with all local authorities, including local authorities in the GDA, to ensure that new social and affordable homes can be delivered from the public land bank, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>In terms of the strategic development of the State&rsquo;s residential land bank, all local authority sites have been mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland land map. The map includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites amounting to some 1,700 hectares including the land owned by local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area and is available at the following link: . </p><p>All local authorities are being funded to significantly increase their delivery of social housing, as part of the Rebuilding Ireland programme, and a strong social housing construction pipeline is already in place for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. A detailed breakdown of the social housing construction programme for all local authorities is set out in the Social Housing Construction Status Report, which is published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 2 of 2019 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: . Further projects will continue to be added to the programme on an ongoing basis.</p><p>In terms of affordable housing, a targeted approach is being pursued to support local authorities.  Significant housing delivery is to be achieved through the Serviced Site Fund (SSF), where &euro;310 million has been allocated to support the delivery of at least 6,200 affordable homes over the next three years.  Following two calls to date for bids under the SSF, I have allocated funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the delivery of more than 3,200 affordable homes. Of this &euro;127m,  over half has been awarded to projects in the Greater Dublin Area which will in turn provide for a potential 2,213 new affordable homes to follow. Many of these sites will include a tenure mix and accommodate further social and private homes. My Department will continue to engage proactively with the local authorities to accelerate the delivery of these projects.  A further SSF call for proposals will issue in 2020.</p><p><b>Table: </b>List of projects in the GDA that have received approval in principle under SSF first and second call for proposals.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>LA</th>       <th>Project Description</th>       <th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal - &euro;</th>       <th>Provisional Exchequer Grant Amount - &euro;</th>       <th>Provisional LA Contribution - &euro;</th>       <th>Affordable Housing Potential</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>Cherry Orchard </td>       <td>&euro;7,645,415</td>       <td>&euro;6,804,419</td>       <td>&euro;840,996</td>       <td>215</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>Balbutcher, Ballymun </td>       <td>&euro;4,135,351</td>       <td>&euro;3,680,462</td>       <td>&euro;454,889</td>       <td>74</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>Sillogue, Ballymun</td>       <td>&euro;3,975,000</td>       <td>&euro;3,537,750</td>       <td>&euro;437,250</td>       <td>83</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens</td>       <td>&euro;10,233,682</td>       <td>&euro;9,107,977</td>       <td>&euro;1,125,705</td>       <td>165</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR</td>       <td>Enniskerry Road</td>       <td>&euro;4,537,576</td>       <td>&euro;4,038,443</td>       <td>&euro;499,133</td>       <td>50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR</td>       <td>Ballyogan Court</td>       <td>&euro;2,342,745</td>       <td>&euro;2,085,043</td>       <td>&euro;257,702</td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR</td>       <td>St Laurences Park, Stillorgan</td>       <td>&euro;1,960,698</td>       <td>&euro;1,745,021</td>       <td>&euro;215,677</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Church Fields, Mulhuddart</td>       <td>&euro;11,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;9,790,000</td>       <td>&euro;1,210,000</td>       <td>760</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Dun Emer, Lusk</td>       <td>&euro;1,500,000</td>       <td>&euro;1,335,000</td>       <td>&euro;165,000</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Hackettstown, Skerries</td>       <td>&euro;2,198,667</td>       <td>&euro;1,956,814</td>       <td>&euro;241,853</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Cappaghfinn</td>       <td>&euro;3,552,500</td>       <td>&euro;3,161,725</td>       <td>&euro;390,775</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Ardclough Road, Celbridge</td>       <td>&euro;363,732</td>       <td>&euro;323,721</td>       <td>&euro;40,011</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin Co Co</td>       <td>Killinarden</td>       <td>&euro;9,987,000</td>       <td>&euro;8,888,430</td>       <td>&euro;1,098,570</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>Rathcoole</td>       <td>&euro;3,712,000</td>       <td>&euro;3,303,680</td>       <td>&euro;408,320</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>Clonburris</td>       <td>&euro;6,968,000</td>       <td>&euro;6,201,520</td>       <td>&euro;766,480</td>       <td>133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>Rathnew</td>       <td>&euro;676,000</td>       <td>&euro;601,640</td>       <td>&euro;74,360</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;74,788,366</td>       <td>&euro;66,561,645</td>       <td>&euro;8,226,721</td>       <td>2,213</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The mission statement of the Department is to promote, nurture and develop Ireland&rsquo;s Arts, culture and Heritage; to support and promote the use of the Irish language and to facilitate the development of Gaeltacht and the Islands.</p><p>Promoting the work of the Department gives an opportunity to offer a unique window to the richness and variety of our culture and give easy access to information on galleries, museum and events happening locally.  It helps give the public knowledge and opportunities to experience our national parks, nature resources and waterways and also builds awareness and knowledge of our natural heritage and biodiversity.  It helps raise appreciation of the Irish language and presents the relevance, vitality and value of the language. </p><p>The Department's communications strategy encompasses use of media across the wide range of schemes and programmes operated under the auspices of my Department. </p><p>The Department's communication presence and its management is undertaken by the Department&lsquo;s in-house Communications and Press Office team which comprises 5 staff.
