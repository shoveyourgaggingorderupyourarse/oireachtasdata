The NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.  </p><p>It is expected that the Group will make recommendations shortly concerning a revised scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.  Before any changes are made, there will be consultations with stakeholders.</p><p>Following settlement which was reached last week regarding 2 High Court cases where children with special educational needs were seeking access to the July Provision Scheme, officials from my Department are meeting with Down Syndrome Ireland today.  I look forward to meeting with the organisation myself shortly.</p></reply>

This will facilitate the replacement of over 600 prefabs which is a key element of our prefab replacement programme. It will also facilitate the provision/modernisation of the sports facilities and science laboratories in these schools.</p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<i></i>A new 16 classroom primary school (to be established in September 2019) in Ashbourne and a new special school in Dublin 15 were also announced in 2019 bringing the overall total to 44.</p><p>As the deputy is aware I announced details of the structural remediation programme last week which has now commenced.</p><p>My Department regularly updates the current position on all projects on the school building programme and this information is available in county format on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>The NCSE has formally advised me that there is insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15.</p><p>This letter is the formal activation of section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018). This contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.</p><p>I am not happy with the progress made so far and additional special classes are required. I am therefore appealing to the communities concerned to open their schools to receive children with special education needs into their schools next September.  </p><p>The NCSE and my Department are available to advise and support school boards of management in making decisions to open new special classes. </p></reply>

The review report, launched on 17 June, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the National Youthreach Programme and, making use of both quantitative and qualitative data, demonstrates the positive impact of Youthreach for learners.  </p>  <p>  There are significant supports in place within the school system to support retention of students to the end of post-primary.  This includes the comprehensive package of measures delivered through DEIS and the various elements of the School Completion programme managed by Tusla.   There are also formal statutory mechanisms for follow up by Tusla in respect of students under the age of 16.  School retention rates been steadily improving and 91% of learners now complete senior cycle.</p>  <p>  However, there is no formal mechanism in place to refer early school leavers over the age of 16 into second chance education. The evaluation noted that the referral process to Youthreach was often through informal networks and, although centres typically had good engagement with schools and services, steps should be taken to ensure that all early school leavers who are interested in Youthreach have the opportunity to avail of it.  My Department will be engaging with SOLAS and other partners on the implementation of this recommendation.</p></reply>

Student services support each individual student to achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p><p>In relation to the provision of services within the institutions, the position is that my Department's provides recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority for direct disbursement to its designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to these institutions, and the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of student services, is a matter for the individual institution.</p><p>The National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report, 2017 made a number of recommendations in this area and highlighted the good practice and innovative initiatives aimed at supporting students experiencing mental health difficulties in many institutions, as outlined in the AHEAD report <i>Mental Health Matters. </i>The Department of Health is developing a National Healthy Campus Framework whose aims include to support and recognise the work of institutions in improving the health and wellbeing of campus communities, and to generate and disseminate knowledge for promoting health and wellbeing on campus. In addition a working group has been convened by the Higher Education Authority to progress actions under the Connecting for Life (CfL) strategy, and the first meeting of the group was in December 2018. The group includes representatives from my Department, higher education institutions, student counsellors, and USI.</p></reply>

My Department has commenced the process of restoring capitation this year with a 5% increase in capitation funding that will apply from the start of the 2019/2020 school year. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has recently announced an increase to the back to school allowance for the 2019/2020 school, bringing the total budget provision for the scheme to over &euro;56 million this year.</p>  <p>  I also want to give parents a strong voice in ensuring costs are always kept to a minimum. My Department published a Circular in 2017 which details the measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. In addition, work on the drafting of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 is close to being finalised and I intend to seek Government approval shortly for its publication. Under the Bill, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners. The charter legislation will include requirements for consultation and engagement with parents and students on matters relating to school life and will include provision for full transparency in relation to costs and the use of any voluntary contributions sought by schools.</p>  <p>  I believe that these actions will also significantly strengthen the focus on reducing back to school costs for parents.</p></reply>

This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Additionally some pupils with developmental issues may require an assessment of need, which is provided by the HSE services. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with difficulties including those with developmental delay. Teachers consult with their NEPS psychologist for assistance should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become directly involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological support. I would advise that parents of children in schools for whom concerns exist in relation to developmental delay should, in the first instance, raise the matter with the principal of the relevant school with a view to involving the assigned NEPS psychologist in the issue, where appropriate.</p></reply>

Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>The NCSE has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). In this regard, SENOs meet schools and parents. </p><p>This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  </p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes.  It is open to any school to make application to the National Council for Special education (NCSE) to establish a special class.  </p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>The new power to compel schools to make additional special education provision available has yet to be invoked.  </p><p>While the NCSE and the Department continue to encourage stakeholders to open special classes, the process under the admissions legislation will continue and may lead to interaction with education providers entering a more formal process. </p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. This Policy Advice is to be completed and a report submitted to the Minister no later than June 2020.</p><p>Parents who need assistance/advice or who are experiencing difficulties in locating a specialised placement, should contact their local SENO.

These strategies include, in particular, the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019. </p><p>According to an OECD 2017 Report, the employment prospects and expected financial benefits from completing tertiary education in Ireland are higher than in most other European countries, indicating that the education system provides skills that are relevant to the labour market.  This finding is supported by the analysis contained in the recent independent impact assessment of Irish universities carried out by Indecon and commissioned by the Irish Universities Association.  </p><p>In relation to graduate supply, in 2017 there were a total of 48,931 graduates from the Higher Education system.  Of this number, a significant proportion were in key skills areas, 2,765 were in ICT, 5,729 in Engineering Manufacturing and Construction and 4,200 in Science and Maths.  </p><p>The National Employer Survey completed in Q2 2018, has shown that employers are very satisfied with graduate recruits across a range of personal and workplace attributes, including computer and technical literacy, working effectively with others and numeracy/processing numerical data. Overall satisfaction with higher education graduates was 86% and for further education and training graduates overall satisfaction was 84%. The satisfaction with the computer and technology literacy of graduates is very high (88% for Higher Education, 83% for Further Education and Training). </p><p>Future Jobs Ireland, which was launched in March 2019 is a new whole-of Government plan to secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic success.  A key element of Future Jobs Ireland is to support business, invest in the development of people and to ensure our education and training system is responsive to enterprise needs. </p><p>Technology Skills 2022: Ireland&rsquo;s Third ICT Skills Action Plan which is a collaborative effort by Government, the higher and further education and training system and industry to meet Ireland&rsquo;s high level ICT skills needs<b></b>was recently published.  The plan has devised measures that will boost the supply of ICT graduates to meet the ambitious level of demand forecast for the coming years. By 2022, the interventions outlined in this plan aim to deliver up to an additional 5,000 graduates per annum through indigenous supply, with the remainder serviced by inward migration.</p><p>In addition, I recently launched the Report of the independent Review of Career Guidance Tools and Information carried out by Indecon International Consultants.  The report which contains 18 far reaching recommendations under four themes: Reforms to Governance and Delivery Arrangements, Improvement in Career Guidance Tools and Career Information, Enhancement of Enterprise Engagement and Promotion of Inclusion, will ensure that my Department is providing high quality, relevant career guidance information to students from post&ndash;primary level up to further and higher education. A Departmental internal taskforce has been established to examine each of the recommendations and develop a prioritised implementation plan.  </p><p>I am satisfied that these and other important elements of my Departments strategies, developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, will help ensure that we are well prepared to meet our skills needs on an ongoing basis and to support the long-term success of our economy.</p></reply>

This compares to 60 such special classes in 2011/12. In the period 2011 to 2019, the number of SSLD special classes has ranged from 60 - 65, depending on need.</p>  <p>  My Department provides an extensive range of supports for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).  This includes provision for the establishment of special classes for pupils with SSLD in primary schools. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including applications to establish special classes for SSLD.  Applications meeting the criteria for establishment are approved by the NCSE.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new classes or retain current classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open/retain classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision, and they must also be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.</p>  <p>  The opening and retention of a Speech and Language class is, however, contingent on the HSE being in a position to provide Speech and Language therapy to the students in the class.  The availability and provision of speech and language therapy is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  My Department has recently set up a working group to consider the criteria for Specific Learning Disability (SLD) and Specific Speech and Language Therapy (SSLD). The aim of the working group is twofold:</p>  <p>  -  To review the current definition of SLD and SSLD, which continues to be used as a criteria for entry to Reading schools, special SLD classes, for Assistive Technology and other supports for students with SLD </p>  <p>  - To develop a new definition/criteria for SLD and SSLD and for entry to special Reading Schools and special SLD and SSLD classes.</p>  <p>  NCSE SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p>  <p>  Communication devices which are not specific educational interventions, or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through the HSE Aids and Appliances scheme are not provided for under this scheme. </p></reply>

I am interested to listen to the views of the experts, but more importantly to engage with ideas and proposals on how to support and sustain small schools as a key component of the primary education system.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools, i.e. schools with four classroom teachers or fewer.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, measures have been introduced to improve the staffing of these schools which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools. Additional supports were introduced for primary schools on the islands.   In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  </p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  For the current school year, the staffing schedule at Primary level operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.</p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Any additional improvement in the pupil teacher ratio would have to be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken. </p></reply>

The NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs which might include some children with Down syndrome. </p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.  </p><p>It is expected that the Group will make recommendations shortly concerning a revised scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.

Under this provision, there will be a protection to ensure that a child of a minority faith, can still access a school of their faith or a similar faith. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced on the 3rd of December 2018, also provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. A number of sections of the Act were commenced in 2018. </p>  <p>  Whereas most children, including children with special educational needs, will be able to be enrolled in the school or school placement of their choice there are circumstances where it may be difficult for parents to obtain the school or special class placement of their choice. </p>  <p>  The Government is spending nearly one euro in every five of the education budget on special education &ndash; about &euro;1.9 billion.  We have significantly increased the availability of special classes for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this additional investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to pressure on school places for children with special needs, it is vital that all children, including those with special educational needs, can access an appropriate and sustainable placement.  </p>  <p>  I have been assured that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), an independent agency of the Department, is actively engaging with schools, patron bodies, parents, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs to try to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  As Minister, my objective is for children, including children with special educational needs, to access education in as inclusive a setting as possible where they will experience a welcoming school environment.  </p>  <p>  Following the commencement of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, a power has been created to allow me to compel a school to make additional provision for special education.  </p>  <p>  The power has yet to be invoked and I believe it should only be used as a measure of last resort.   </p>  <p>  As Minister, I hope that schools, patrons and boards of managements can be encouraged to work together with the NCSE to meet demand in the best interests of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that every child has a suitable placement available to them from September is a key priority for me and my Department. </p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics.</p><p>In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.</p><p>The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. </p><p>The Steering Group oversees the implementation of the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018. Several of the actions are aimed at supporting Irish teachers who are considering returning to Ireland to take up teaching positions, including:</p><p>- The commencement of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools in the 2019/20 school year, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0015/2019. This scheme will support young teachers in obtaining full time employment and enhance curricular choices in post primary schools.</p><p>- An online teacher recruitment portal is being developed which will facilitate the recruitment of short term substitute teachers by primary and post primary schools. It is intended that the portal will be in place for the coming school year.</p><p>- The use of digital technology by schools to facilitate interviewing applicants, for teaching posts, is also being explored, particularly in the case of qualified applicants resident outside the State.</p><p>- The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration ofteachers, including those originally from Ireland, who qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.</p><p>- In December 2018, a national campaign to promote the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media, supported by a new dedicated webpage <i>www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms</i>. This website provides useful information about teaching as a career in Ireland.</p><p>The Deputy is referring also to my recent Education Trade Mission to the UAE.</p><p>While in the UAE, I engaged with 450 Irish teachers at two meetings in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  These meetings gave me the opportunity to hear the challenges facing these teachers and also gave them a chance to offer practical solutions to some issues. </p><p>The meetings allowed me in my role as Minister to meet with these teachers and discuss first hand with them the challenges they face in returning to Ireland and to consider ways that we can work together, to support them, when and if they decide to return to work in Ireland.</p><p>To facilitate this, teachers volunteered to form a group to liaise on the identified issues with the embassy and my Department. Arrangements are being made for the first meeting of this group in the Autumn.</p><p>I want to thank the Irish ambassador and his staff in the Embassy, the local Irish groups, including the GAA, and the Irish living in the UAE for the work they did to make this visit a success.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The matter of the H. Dip Allowance is the basis of a claim under the TCC. Discussions are taking place under the auspices of the TCC, to which the Department, school management and teacher unions are all party. As the proceedings of the TCC are confidential, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the campus is currently operating and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo Campus, as well as a strategic and comprehensive plan to address the financial and sustainability issues which have been experienced by the GMIT Mayo Campus.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the plan includes 33 recommendations, the majority of which are for GMIT to implement. A sub-committee has been established to oversee and monitor the implementation of the working group report. My Department has prioritised the recommendations that relate specifically to the Department. This includes the allocation last year of &euro;750,000 per annum for a period of 5 years to assist the sustainability of the campus. The provision of this additional funding is contingent on GMIT continuing to make progress on implementing the recommendations of the review which is subject to ongoing review by the HEA. My Department also provided the capital funding for the replacement of the roof of the GMIT campus which was in need of repair. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are continuing to work closely with GMIT to ensure that all of the recommendations of the report are progressed. The working group report acknowledged the complexities and the necessary implementation time required for a number of the recommendations. </p>  <p>  I would like to again assure the Deputy that my Department and the HEA will continue to work with GMIT on ensuring that the recommendations of the Working Group are implemented as soon as possible, and with appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders, to ensure the future sustainability of the Castlebar campus.</p></reply>

These include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools.  NABMSE met with boards and patrons on 6<sup>th</sup>June to discuss the matter and options available.  An official from my Department attended this meeting.  </p><p>At this stage, the Group Scheme proposal appears to be the most viable.  The importance of all schools signing up for such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting and all school representatives who were in attendance, were in favour of exploring the Group Scheme option. </p><p>15 special schools have contacted my Department directly, who are experiencing difficulty in paying insurance premiums currently.

My Department has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to 2 special schools to date, amounting to &euro; 36,860.

Goal 2 in the Action Plan commits to advancing the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage and learners with special educational needs in order to support them to achieve their potential. Equality of opportunity is at the heart of our vision.</p>  <p>  The Report on Education Inequality and Disadvantage and Barriers to Education by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills was published recently. </p>  <p>  The Joint Committee met on two occasions to during 2018 to discuss the topic of education inequality and disadvantage. At these meetings it also heard from a range of Stakeholders including senior officials from my Department.  </p>  <p>  The aim of  the examination by the Joint Committee was to focus on solutions to the issue of education inequality and disadvantage.  Areas covered in the examination include my Department's DEIS programme and if it can be improved; if an education system can be created which increases participation in post-secondary education, especially among groups with traditionally low rates of participation; the benefits that equal access to education can provide particularly among groups who experience high instances of poverty, addiction and other social issues especially those who live in areas of deprivation. </p>  <p>  Based on the contributions made at both meetings,  the Joint Committee made six conclusions and forty four recommendations in the Report. </p>  <p>  My Department is investing heavily in supporting learners at risk of educational disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage. DEIS provides additional supports to 896 schools identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged communities, serving approximately 183,000 pupils, at an overall cost of &euro;125 million per annum.  Schools can use these additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort. </p>  <p>  My Department's Further Education and Training Strategy set out a vision to transform the sector, and provide a focus for the annual funding and investment priorities, to deliver a world-class integrated system of further education and training that would support economic development, increase social inclusion and to meet the needs of all who engage with the sector.  SOLAS are currently developing a new Further Education and Training Strategy which will cover the next five year period from 2020.  This provides an opportunity to refresh commitments on how further education and training can support inclusion of diverse and marginalised groups in education and training, society and the labour market. </p>  <p>  The Progress Review of the National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education was published in December 2018. It highlighted an increase in participation rates across a number of the target groups with particularly high increases for students with disabilities and among socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education.  &euro;16.2m secured through the budgetary process has enabled three strands of the PATH fund to be rolled out. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining those recommendations made by the Joint Committee which come under its remit, in the context of the supports currently available.  </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools;</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools;</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). The announcement followed nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. </p><p>A new 500 pupil post-primary school to be established in Enfield in 2020 was included in the new schools announcement.</p><p>In addition the following developments in the south of County Meath may be of interest to the Deputy:</p><p>- In 2014, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school, De Lacy College, was established under the patronage of Louth and Meath ETB to serve the Ashbourne school planning area. The school has a current enrolment of some 400 pupils in the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>- A project to provide an extension to St. Peter&rsquo;s College, Dunboyne to cater for an additional 225 students was recently completed.</p><p>- Dunshaughlin post-primary school planning area is catered for by Dunshaughlin Community College. The school operates under the patronage of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB) and has a current enrolment in the region of 1,000 pupils. The school is experiencing demand for additional school places and the LMETB is open to assisting in meeting this demand.  The ETB has submitted an application for additional accommodation which my Department is currently considering. The outcome will assist my Department in determining the future need in the area. In the meantime, my Department has approved the provision of additional temporary accommodation - 8 general classrooms and 1 science lab - to LMETB to meet the school&rsquo;s immediate needs.</p><p>- An extension project for Ratoath Community College, to provide for a total of 1,300 pupils in the school, is currently in the final stages of being re-tendered. </p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and will have regard for the increased roll out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to restore payscales to all public servants in an affordable and sustainable manner. Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement to date have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement. </p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, may also benefit from the measures which will see interventions at points 4 and 8 of the pay scales for all such relevant new entrants to the public service. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has conducted a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties of recruitment and retention in the Defence Sector. The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is expected to bring the report prepared by the Commission to Government shortly. The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations in the report.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.179.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500064#WRD03900"><p>Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.  It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The UK claimed sovereignty over Rockall in 1955 and sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.</p>  <p>  While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, we have never sought to claim sovereignty ourselves.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries should have no significance for establishing legal claims to continental shelf.  This position is now reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: &lsquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rsquo;  Accordingly, sovereignty over Rockall and rights to the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall sits are two separate issues.  </p>  <p>  Under the UN Convention all coastal states are entitled to a continental shelf that extends to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles if the geological continental margin does not actually extend that far.  Where a State claims a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 miles it must demonstrate to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that geologically the margin extends beyond that distance and must provide data to support its case.  </p>  <p>  In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries in both the Hatton Rockall area of the North East Atlantic and in the Celtic Sea to the south, stretching out up 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  Under the UN Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary in the Hatton-Rockall area.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the 1988 agreement between Ireland and the UK, the claims by both countries to the Hatton-Rockall shelf beyond 200 miles are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.  The four countries began to meet regularly from 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  </p>  <p>  The UN Convention imposes a ten-year deadline for the making of continental shelf submissions to the UN Commission and the deadline expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore arranged to make the submission in March of that year, as did the British Government in respect of the UK&rsquo;s claim.  Denmark submitted its claim on behalf of the Faroe Islands in 2010.  Iceland has not made a submission to date.</p>  <p>  The UN Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent its consideration of a submission relating to a disputed area without the consent of all the States concerned and Iceland does not currently consent to the consideration of these submissions.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s submission within the deadline preserved the State&rsquo;s legal position and since then the Government has continued to work for the creation of conditions that will permit its consideration by the UN Commission as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The exclusive economic zone (or EEZ) is the body of water beyond the territorial sea that lies above the continental shelf between 12 and 200 nautical miles from shore.  In 2013 Ireland and the UK reached agreement on boundaries between the two countries&rsquo; EEZs.  The 2013 agreement built on the 1988 Agreement that established continental shelf boundaries and it provides that those boundaries, slightly adjusted to ensure that no waters were lost to the high seas, shall also be the EEZ boundaries.  This created a single maritime boundary between 12 and 200 miles in the water and on the seabed beneath.  </p>  <p>  Nothing in either agreement altered Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding position on Rockall, nor does either agreement have any implications for the present difficulties between Ireland and Scotland over fishing within 12 miles of Rockall.</p></reply>

I note that, on 15 June, the passage of this legislation was suspended indefinitely by the Hong Kong authorities in response to ongoing protests by Hong Kong citizens. </p>  <p>  The Consulate General in Hong Kong has been closely monitoring and reporting on developments in relation to the proposed extradition bill and the related demonstrations.  The Consul General, along with the EU Office and representatives of other EU Member States, has engaged directly with the Hong Kong authorities to set out our concerns with the proposed bill.  </p>  <p>  In this House last week, I highlighted Ireland's support for the right of citizens to assembly and freedom of expression, which are provided for under Hong Kong's Basic Law.  I urged demonstrators to express their rights in a peaceful manner, and for the police to respect these rights and to exercise restraint in response. I note that while the demonstrations have continued since the suspension of the proposed legislation, they have largely passed without incident, which is welcome.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation through our Consulate General in Hong Kong.</p></reply>

In order to tackle this challenge, the EU is building a robust framework for coordinated action which is fully in line with European values and fundamental rights.</p>  <p>  The most recent EEAS / European Commission Report on the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Action Plan Against Disinformation was released on 14 June 2019.  The Report found that available evidence did not permit  the identification of a distinct cross-border disinformation campaign from external sources specifically targeting the European elections.  However, it concluded that the evidence collected revealed a continued and sustained disinformation activity by Russian sources, aiming to suppress turnout and influence voter preferences. </p>  <p>  According to the EU's East Strategic Communication Task Force, activity covered a broad range of topics, ranging from challenging the Union&rsquo;s democratic legitimacy to exploiting divisive public debates on issues such as migration and sovereignty. </p>  <p>  While it is too early to draw final conclusions about the level and impact of this disinformation, it is clear that the measures adopted to date by the European Council - the EU Joint Action Plan against Disinformation and the dedicated Elections Package - helped to deter attacks and expose disinformation.</p>  <p>  Within the framework of these actions, individuals and organisations, including journalists, fact checkers, online platforms, national authorities, researchers and civil society organisations contributed to raising awareness about how to counter the threat.  This increased public awareness made it harder for malicious actors to manipulate the public debate.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the EU has strengthened its capabilities to identify and counter disinformation, via the Strategic Communication Task Forces and the EU Hybrid Fusion Cell in the European External Action Service.  A Rapid Alert System has also been established to facilitate the prompt exchange of information between Member States and the EU institutions where suspect disinformation campaigns have been detected. </p>  <p>  During the election period the EU worked closely with online platforms and industry through a voluntary Code of Practice to increase the transparency of political communications and to prevent the manipulative use of their services.  This allows users to know why they see specific political content and ads, and see where they come from and who is behind them. </p>  <p>  The fight against disinformation is a long-term challenge that concerns all parts of our societies and requires continuous commitment and efforts. The private sector, especially the online platforms, have a particular responsibility. The Commission will shortly report back to the European Council in more detail on the implementation of the measures introduced during the election period and on the effectiveness of the Voluntary Code of Practice. Further proposals to strengthen our collective action in response to this ever-evolving threat are likely. </p></reply>

The Department did not receive any request for a reasonable accommodation during the seven week period for the submission of applications, or any stage prior to the appeals process deadline.

Further information is set out in the Information Note attached to this response.</p><p>The EU and the OSCE-ODHIR regularly issue calls for the nomination of observers to participate in the election missions organised under their auspices. The Department reviews each call and responds accordingly on a case-by-case basis, including with regard to the overall annual budget available for participation in election observation missions and the resources of the Department's Elections Desk. </p><p>Information concerning Ireland's substantial contribution to the OSCE election observation mission in Ukraine is set out in the response to Parliamentary Question No. 51 of 18 April 2019, to which I refer the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ireland looks forward to advancing all five strands of the Strategy.   </p>  <p>  The FAC also examined the effectiveness of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy.  Ministers discussed ways in which the EU can ensure greater unity, coherence and consistency in its external action, to allow us to respond to future foreign and security challenges in a more flexible and strategic way.  </p>  <p>  On Sudan, the Council condemned the use of violence against civilians and reiterated support to the African Union.  The priority for Sudan is to find a swift consensus that allows the transfer of power to a civilian-led authority.</p>  <p>  Foreign Ministers also discussed regional issues with the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, including the Middle East Peace Process, the Gulf, Iran and Syria.

SFCT is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel.  Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT.  Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border controls in relation to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel entering the State from Northern Ireland.  Similarly, the transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.</p>  <p>  Currently in Northern Ireland, there is no carbon tax on coal and solid fuel environmental standards are lower than in the State.  These factors combined with currency fluctuations and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s lower VAT rate on solid fuel can give rise to significant price differentials between the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection by Revenue of SFCT is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State.  The regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards.  The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact at present with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.  I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p></reply>

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability, and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 &lsquo;Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 &lsquo;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&rsquo;) to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until:</p>  <p>  a. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p>  b. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65% to 100% and the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100% funding over the next number of years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, has prepared a public consultation paper on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020.  This consultation, which has now been published on the Department of Finance website, is open to all persons and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to submit feedback.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance I have reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and that since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo).</p></reply>

This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I understand and fully sympathise with any person who suffers from a serious physical disability and can&rsquo;t access the scheme under the current criteria.  However, given the scope and scale of the scheme, any possible changes to it can only be made after careful consideration, taking into account the existing and prospective cost of the scheme as well as the availability of other schemes which seek to help with the mobility of disabled persons, and the interaction between each of these schemes.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the qualifying medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme at this time.</p><p>Finally, I would like to point out that legislation is being brought forward by the Minister for Health to replace the closed Motorised Transport Grant. </p></reply>

I regularly attend these meetings to discuss these developments with my European counterparts and the European Institutions.</p>  <p>  At the recent ECOFIN meeting on June 14, there was a general update on the EU economic situation given by the Commission and the ECB but no specific discussion on the expansion of the ECB&rsquo;s quantitative easing (QE programme).</p>  <p>  Momentum in the global economy slowed sharply towards the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, amidst a downturn in global manufacturing and trade.  Euro Area headline inflation rate in May was 1.2 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent in April 2019. On this basis, average annual Euro Area inflation in the first five months of 2019 is 1.4 per cent.  The ECB projects that inflation will remain below target &ndash; an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2 per cent &ndash; across the forecast horizon, reaching 1.6 per cent in 2021. </p>  <p>  The current performance of the global economy is set against a background of increased uncertainty.  Risks to economic outlook are significant and include the timing and nature of Brexit, a slowdown in the US and Chinese economies, further intensification of trade tensions, and increasing global indebtedness. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the ECB President Mario Draghi&rsquo;s recent speech (18 June) on twenty years of the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy, where he referred to the current economic outlook and downside risks facing the European economy.  President Draghi noted that in the absence of a return of inflation to the ECB&rsquo;s target additional stimulus will be required.  Further, that in the coming weeks, the ECB Governing Council will consider how the instruments at their disposal can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability. </p></reply>

This bond, which was the first bond issued under the ISGB Framework published in September 2018, matures on 18 March 2031.</p><p>As regards the use of ISGB proceeds, the Framework provides that the intention is that an amount equal to the net proceeds of any ISGB will be allocated to finance new projects or to refinance existing projects, which qualify as Eligible Green Projects.  As set out in the Framework, an annual Allocation Report will be made available which will include, amongst other things, the total amount allocated to Eligible Green Projects.</p><p>I am advised by the NTMA that the first ISGB Allocation Report will shortly be published.  The Report was prepared by the ISGB Working Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, which includes representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the NTMA. </p><p>The Report will show that just under &euro;2 billion &ndash; representing 65% &ndash; of the funds raised in the syndicated transaction last October was allocated to Eligible Green Projects outstanding as at end-2018.  This leaves an amount of just over &euro;1 billion yet to be allocated. </p><p>The NTMA expects to raise additional funds from the issue of ISGBs.  In the first instance, this would be done by issuing more of the existing 2031 bond with timing dependent on market demand and investor feedback. </p><p>The National Development Plan 2018-2027 outlines an extensive set of projects and programmes, many of which meet the Eligible Green Project criteria set out in the Framework and therefore eligible for allocation.

It has not been confirmed whether the principal work concerned refers to an Irish or foreign employment and whether the time spent in the State is for work or personal reasons.  Moreover, information concerning the individual&rsquo;s Irish tax residence and domicile position is not provided.  In such circumstances, it is only possible to give an overview of the taxation provisions as they apply generally.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that an individual&rsquo;s Irish income tax position will depend on the source of the income and his or her tax residence position.</p>  <p>  A statutory residency test applies, whereby an individual is regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes for a tax year if he or she is present in the State for -</p>  <p>  1. 183 days in that tax year, or</p>  <p>  2. 280 days between that tax year and the previous tax year with a minimum of 30 days in any year.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, an individual may also elect to be resident in the State for a tax year.  Further guidance material regarding tax residency rules and the concept of domicile can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available here.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual is considered tax resident and domiciled in the State for a tax year, he or she will be taxable on his or her worldwide income for that year.  This is subject to any relief under the terms of a relevant Double Taxation Agreement (DTA).</p>  <p>  Where an individual is not tax resident, but is ordinarily resident and domiciled in the State, he or she will be taxable on his or her worldwide income with the exception of foreign employment income earned wholly abroad together with any other foreign source income, provided it is less than &euro;3,810.  This is also subject to any relief due under the terms of a relevant DTA.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual is neither tax resident nor ordinarily resident in the State, he or she will be liable to Irish income tax on his or her Irish source income only.  This position applies regardless of where the individual is domiciled.</p>  <p>  Where an individual is tax resident, but not domiciled, in the State, he or she will be liable to Irish income tax on both his or her Irish source income and his or her foreign income to the extent it is remitted.</p>  <p>  Where an individual is not tax resident in the State but is ordinarily resident in, and not domiciled in, the State, he or she will be liable to Irish tax on his or her Irish source income and his or her foreign income to the extent it is remitted.  However, income from an employment all duties of which are performed outside the State is not liable to Irish income tax, even if remitted.</p></reply>

The Attorney General and his office have reviewed the proposals and given thorough and excellent advice to ensure that any legislation brought forward will be robust and sound.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500065#WRE06600"><p>At the outset, it is important to clarify that the main recommendation (recommendation 11) of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report was to establish the National Claims Information Database (NCID) on a legislative basis to facilitate a more in-depth analysis of annual trends in motor insurance claims.  This was seen as key to developing an understanding of how claims costs are impacting premiums, in particular understanding the relationship between the price paid by a customer for motor insurance and the cost to insurance undertakings.</p><p>The NCID therefore will produce an annual statistical analysis of the factors related to the cost of insurance, including the underlying trends in the market such as where claims are settled, the various costs associated with the claims process etc.  It is this bigger picture perspective that needs to be obtained, if we are to develop a greater clarity on how the market operates, in order to provide us with the evidence necessary for an appropriate policy response.  Arising from this, the majority of information collected will be at an aggregate level only, i.e. not on a claim-by-claim basis.  Some claim&ndash;by-claim level information will be collected on very large claims, but no personally identifiable information, as defined by GDPR regulations, will be collected.</p><p>It was also recommended that the Department of Finance explore the feasibility of an insurance claim-by-claim register in the longer term.  This was implemented through the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Report on the Feasibility of an Insurance Claim-by-Claim Register <i>()</i>.  This report concluded that based on its public consultation exercise and on its own analysis that a compelling case had not been put forward for the establishment of a claim-by-claim register.  It indicated that it was not possible to fully assess in detail the feasibility of such a register as no clear need or purpose has been put forward on which to base a consideration of:</p><p>- the specific data that would be required;</p><p>- the appropriateness of that data in terms of necessity, effectiveness and proportionality;</p><p>- the specific data protection and commercial sensitivity impacts;</p><p>- the logistics involved in collection, processing, access and sharing of the data, including the likely need to procure a technology services provider to administer the register; and</p><p>- whether the financial cost, which would likely be similar to that of the Central Credit Register, would be worthwhile.</p><p>In addition, an important point that the Oireachtas considered during deliberations on the NCID legislation was on the need for the database to be established in the short-to-medium term.  The aggregate nature of the data collected has meant that there are fewer legal and technical complexities involved, and that is why it has been possibly to have the NCID established already.  To that end, the NCID came into operation earlier this year, with the enactment and commencement of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.  If we were to have gone down a claim-by-claim approach, there would be major data protection implications (GDPR would be a major factor) which would almost certainly take a long time to address and which would add to the complexity and cost of the project without necessarily providing much added value.</p><p>To conclude on this, I understand that the Central Bank has commenced collecting the required data under the NCID from insurers and I look forward to its first report later this year.</p></reply>

At the heart of the programme is the new real-time reporting requirement (to Revenue) for employers in respect of employee income and statutory deductions, including income tax, PRSI, USC and Local Property Tax, which must be completed with each payroll run. It is important to note that there is no change to the actual payment dates and as such no cashflow implications for employers. </p><p>PAYE Modernisation has streamlined the reporting process for employers by eliminating the need to complete the various forms and returns that were required under the old system (e.g. P30, P45, P46, P35, P60) and making it a by-product that is seamlessly generated with each payroll run. Crucially, it provides Revenue with the most up to date pay and deductions details for employees in real-time, which greatly helps in ensuring that taxpayers benefit fully from their various credits and entitlements. Also, for the first time, employees can view the information reported to Revenue on their behalf by employers.</p><p>I am aware that during the two-year design stage of PAYE Modernisation, Revenue worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders in a co-design approach to ensure the new arrangements provide optimum benefit for all to the greatest extent possible. This included employers, representative bodies such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC), the Small Firms&rsquo; Association (SFA) and the Irish SME Association (ISME) as well as the payroll industry. Revenue has confirmed to me that working relationships built up during that time are still operating very effectively and are used to solve any issues that arise as the new arrangements settle down.</p><p>Arising from the co-design approach, Revenue now provides two main options through which employers can submit payroll details. The first involves a direct connection from a business&rsquo; payroll system to Revenue while the second allows employers input payroll details directly via Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS). The second option is particularly aimed at smaller employers who may not use electronic payroll solutions. A paper option is also available where an employer is not e-enabled. Revenue also provides very extensive information for employers on its website at and provides a dedicated Employers Helpline at 01-7383638.  </p><p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the extensive efforts Revenue has made to communicate with and assist employers during both the design and implementation phases of PAYE Modernisation and I congratulate it for delivering such a significant project within a relatively short period of time. Finally, if the Deputy is aware of any specific employers that require assistance with the new reporting requirements, he should advise them to contact Revenue at telephone number 01-6474094 for assistance.</p></reply>

The membership of this Forum includes public service management and union representatives. The implications arising from this claim extend beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and impact across the entire Community and Voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues under consideration.</p>  <p>  The scoping exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain, were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  The Forum met in the period subsequent to the conduct of the scoping exercise where relevant matters in respect of this issue were discussed in comprehensive detail with the members of the Forum. These discussions provided a clear understanding to each of the parties of their respective  positions in relation to this matter and in this context the formal engagement process between the parties was accordingly concluded on this basis.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. I have made enquiries with the Cork NEPS Office and am informed that the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, has not been raised for assessment with the assigned psychologist.</p>  <p>  I would advise therefore that if concerns exist in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of the child in question that her parents should raise them, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

Student services support each individual student to achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of services within the institutions, the position is that my Department provides recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority for direct disbursement to its designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to these institutions, and the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of student services, is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report, 2017 made a number of recommendations in this area and highlighted the good practice and innovative initiatives aimed at supporting students experiencing mental health difficulties in many institutions, as outlined in the ADEAD report Mental Health Matters. The Department of Health is developing a National Healthy Campus Framework whose aims include to support and recognise the work of institutions in improving the health and wellbeing of campus communities, and to generate and disseminate knowledge for promoting health and wellbeing on campus. In addition a working group has been convened by the Higher Education Authority to progress actions under the Connecting for Life (CfL) strategy, and the first meeting of the group was in December 2018. The group includes representatives from my Department, higher education institutions, student counsellors, and USI.  </p></reply>

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

As provided for in the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 (the &ldquo;2012 Act&rdquo;) these cash contributions are received by my Department and are placed in an investment account established by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and are available to Caranua to meet costs incurred in supporting former residents and in meeting the organisation&rsquo;s operational costs and costs associated with the independent appeals process. </p>  <p>  The 2012 Act caps the total cash contributions that may be paid into the NTMA investment account at &euro;110 million (excluding added or accrued interest). To date, a total of &euro;105 million, comprising contributions of some &euro;103.6 million plus added interest of &euro;1.382 million, has been received by my Department. Accordingly, a further &euro;6.4 million in cash contributions is required to achieve the capped amount of &euro;110 million set down in statute. A substantial voluntary cash contribution remains outstanding from the Congregation of Christian Brothers. </p>  <p>  Caranua, which is an independent statutory body, publishes regular updates on its website (www.caranua.ie) regarding expenditure, applications, etc.  The most recent update shows that to end April 2019, Caranua had expended some &euro;85 million on supports and services for former residents and that it had open applications on hands from 1,882 former residents. Administrative costs have also been incurred. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the statutory limit on the funds available to it and the volume of applications on hands and anticipated, Caranua decided to cease to accept applications from 1 August 2018. It is now working to process those remaining applications. Its operations will be wound down during the course of 2019 and the organisation will be dissolved when it has completed the performance of its functions. It is a matter for the organisation to prudentially manage the funds available to it and to ensure that applicants are dealt with in a fair and appropriate manner having regard to the availability of funds.</p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.</p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system. There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy has 15.95 special education teaching hours, for an enrolment of 45 pupils at the time the profile was developed. </p><p>This represents a proportionately a high allocation ratio, which takes into account the school profile. </p><p>It gives an average allocation of 1 special education teacher to every 71 pupils, as opposed to a national average of 1 special education teacher to every 100 pupils in the primary school sector.</p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website .</p><p>Schools were advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken. </p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service and it supports schools in a continuum of support process. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  This Government remains firmly committed to the maintenance of a robust and effective educational psychological service. In this connection as part of Budget 2019 the provision of an additional 10 psychologist post to NEPS from next September was announced, bringing overall number to 204 w.t.e to further strengthen the excellent service provided to our school community.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department launched its Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023 in July 2018. This policy statement provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of wellbeing, which encompasses social and emotional learning across the curriculum.  It builds on the good work already happening in schools to ensure that best practice in whole-school wellbeing promotion is embedded across the system. It outlines a multicomponent, whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills does not make provision for therapeutic counselling in schools. When such counselling is considered to be required a referral is made to an outside agency.  Schools are advised to have identified appropriate referral pathways in consultation with HSE and other mental health services in their local community.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.436.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500068#WRH00400"><p>I recognise the very important work done by school secretaries, and indeed by other support staff, in the running of our schools and I am grateful to them for the contribution they make to our education system.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.</p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.</p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union's claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools or keeping waiting lists.</p><p>I am aware of the need for increased specialist education provision in the Dublin area.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish 167 new special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year of which approximately 156 will be new ASD special classes, which includes new ASD classes in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>There are undoubted challenges when it comes to the establishment of special school and class provision in some schools and communities.</p><p>From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required. In those circumstances, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. This process is ongoing in the Dublin area and the NCSE are actively engaging with schools in relation to establishing ASD classes where there is an identified need for the 2019/2020 school year.</p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.</p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin.</p><p>The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Of these, 17 are ASD Early Intervention Classes, 139 are ASD Primary Classes and 41 are ASD Post Primary Classes. Each ASD Special class provides 6 placements.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular area, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p><p>The new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.</p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>The patronage process for the new post-primary school in Citywest/Saggart, will be run later this year, significantly ahead of its due opening.

To date contributions amounting to some &euro;231 million have been made, in the form of cash, counselling and property transfers.</p><p>Some &euro;125 million of the &euro;128 million provided for under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement has been fully contributed with the transfer of two properties remaining to be fully completed.</p><p>The offers made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report included cash and properties and were valued by the congregations at &euro;352.6 m. Some &euro;106.4 million of the &euro;352.6 million offered has been received to date, including &euro;103.6 million in cash together with properties valued at &euro;2.8 million.  A cash amount of &euro;6.8 million is due from the Congregation of Christian Brothers and is expected to be received in the near future, while an additional contribution of &euro;1 million is expected from the Presentation Brothers.</p><p>Cash contributions from the 2009 offers, not exceeding a total of &euro;110 million, are placed in an investment account opened by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and are available to Caranua (the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund). Cash amounts in excess of the &euro;110 million cap will go towards the costs of developing the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital as will any additional contributions received specifically for that purpose.</p><p>Under the 2009 voluntary offers a total of 18 properties were accepted by the Government for transfer to a number of State bodies. The transfer of 13 of these properties has now been completed but valuations have yet to be obtained in a number of cases.

Those cases were reviewed by the State Claims Agency to assess whether any of those plaintiffs in the extant cases came within the category of victims entitled to compensation which had been identified by the ECtHR.</p><p>Of the 35 extant cases, the SCA identified 7 cases which came within the terms of the Judgment and the Agency made settlement offers of &euro;84,000 in those 7 cases. Six offers were accepted while in the remaining case, the settlement offer was withdrawn as the plaintiff died in August 2015.</p><p>The SCA wrote to the other 28 litigants in March 2015 advising that their circumstances do not appear to come within the parameters of the Judgment and inviting them to revert with any contrary evidence.  To date, no evidence has been submitted to the SCA in any of these 28 cases.</p><p><b>New Litigation since the date of the Judgment in relation to Historic Abuse Claims</b></p><p>Where other plaintiffs institute claims against the State in relation to historic school child sexual abuse which are not statute barred and their circumstances come within the terms of the ECtHR Judgment, the SCA is authorised to make settlement offers to those plaintiffs, on the same basis as the extant cases.</p><p>Since the ECtHR Judgement, the SCA has been notified of many new historic school child abuse claims.  These are either (a) claims which are entirely newly instituted or (b) pre-existing claims against school authorities and in which claimants are now more recently seeking to join the State as a respondent.</p><p><b>Discontinued cases</b></p><p>As part of the State&rsquo;s response to the ECtHR Judgment, the position of historical cases which had been discontinued by plaintiffs was also reviewed.  In July 2015, the Government agreed to respond to those persons who had instituted legal proceedings in relation to school child sexual abuse which were subsequently discontinued and which came within the terms of the Judgment, in a similar way to how it was dealing with persons in the previous two categories.</p><p>As these cases had been discontinued by the Plaintiffs, the proceedings were no longer before the domestic courts and therefore there was no litigation in existence which could be settled.  Accordingly, it was determined that ex gratia payments would be offered to all those persons who come within the terms of the ECtHR Judgment and whose claims were not statute barred at the time of their discontinuance. This process is referred to as the ex gratia scheme and is operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA).</p><p>To date, 50 applications have been received, of which 44 applications have been declined.

Both were published in 2011.</p>  <p>  Improvements which were made to initial teacher education courses include the reconfiguration of the content and duration of courses, with the duration of concurrent (undergraduate) ITE programmes set at a minimum of four years while the consecutive (postgraduate) programmes of teacher education are set at two years, thereby facilitating an innovative re-conceptualisation of programmes.</p>  <p>  The lengthened and reconfigured programmes include substantial periods of school placement as central to student teacher development and a number of mandatory elements including literacy and numeracy, teaching, learning and assessment including school and classroom planning, differentiation, behaviour management, inclusive education (special education, multiculturalism, disadvantage, etc) and ICT in teaching and learning.  These reforms focused on improving the quality of teaching in schools, which is central to the educational outcomes of our children.</p>  <p>  A  first cycle of review and accreditation of all 70 ITE programmes, in accordance with these policies, was completed in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is currently undertaking a review of the impact of the reconfigured ITE programmes and also of the Criteria and Guidelines, which will feed into an update of the procedures and criteria documentation. This review has involved an Impact Consultation Exercise which engaged with current and former ITE students, alongside other stakeholders.  This will inform the next cycle of review and accreditation of all ITE programmes, primary and post-primary, which is due to start in 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Teaching Council&rsquo;s work, there are a number of other developments underway in relation to Initial Teacher Education policy and landscape, through the Teacher Supply Action Plan and the recent publication of The Structure of Initial Teacher Education: Review of Progress in Implementing Reform. My Department has commenced work on the development of a comprehensive Policy Statement for Initial Teacher Education, in collaboration with the Higher Education Authority and the Teaching Council and stakeholders in the higher education sector.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions. As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of student services, is a matter for the individual institution.</p><p>Details of expenditure incurred in respect of counselling services in the third level sector are outlined in the following table.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.</p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.</p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.</p><p>Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned.  Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.  The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that there are 471 schools renting interim accommodation, either temporary prefabricated classrooms or an area within an existing permanent building.  My Department does not hold a record of schools where such interim accommodation is secured from their own funds.</p><p>Where the acquisition of a permanent site by my Department is required, my officials work to secure such a site and confirm its location at the earliest possible date.  However, given the challenges that can arise with the sometimes limited availability of suitable sites and the complexities that can arise during the negotiation and conveyancing stages, the timeframes for the acquisition of school sites can vary significantly.  Details of those projects which are at site acquisition stage, and indeed all projects on the Building Works Programme, are listed and regularly updated on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.gov.ie</i>.  This includes both projects where the school patron is acquiring the site and those where my Department is responsible.</p><p>In relation to the patronage of each of the schools in temporary accommodation by county, this information is not readily available.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005.</p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing</p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council</p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to:</p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs</p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP)</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235 m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential.</p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested.  This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>- SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to over 15,000 at present.</p><p>- Special classes by 160% to over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>- Special education teachers by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,400 at present.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.</p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power to the National Council for Special Educational need to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>I can also advise that, whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement to provide individual education plans for children with special needs, at present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans.  The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. The Guidelines for schools on implementing the new special education teacher allocation model advise schools as to the importance of ensuring that student support plans or educational plans are in place.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made.</p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

The effect of the delegation was that the special schools under their patronage needed to seek separate insurance cover. </p>  <p>  The mechanism for funding schools, including special schools, is through the provision of capitation for running costs including insurance. There is no scope to provide additional funding to schools outside this mechanism.</p>  <p>  Additional funding has been made available to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools that will apply from the start of the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  While some special schools under the patronage of organisations funded by the HSE under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act are among special schools that are experiencing increases in insurance costs in recent years, since the funded bodies were delegated to the General Indemnity Scheme (GIS) under the State Claims Agency, over 50% of special schools that are not under this patronage, have always had separate insurance cover funded from their capitation grants and have not had the benefit of being included as part of a larger body's insurance cover. </p>  <p>  My Department is working as a matter of urgency with NABMSE and relevant Government departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the State Claims Agency, to seek a resolution to the issue of increased insurance costs in special schools. </p>  <p>  A number of options have been identified to address the issue.  These include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools, which, at this stage, appears to be the most viable.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with NABMSE in recent weeks to explore options for establishing a group insurance scheme. NABMSE has agreed to facilitate the establishment of a group insurance scheme on behalf of special schools.</p>  <p>  As a first step, NABMSE met with boards and patrons on 6th June to discuss the matter and options available.  An official from my Department attended this meeting. The importance of all special schools signing up for such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting and all school representatives who were in attendance, were in favour of exploring the Group Scheme option. </p>  <p>  Special Schools have until the 28th June to return a letter authorising NABMSE to represent the schools on all matters pertaining to the proposed special school insurance &lsquo;Group Scheme&rsquo;. NABMSE hope to publish a request for tender for a brokerage service on receipt of letters of authorization from schools and have a broker in place before the end of July.</p>  <p>  15 special schools have contacted my Department directly, who are experiencing difficulty in paying insurance premiums currently, some of which were facing closure as a result. These schools report increases in insurance of between 30% to over 700% in recent years. </p>  <p>  My Department has agreed to provide advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to a number of special schools and is currently engaging with the schools involved in this regard. An advance in capitation has been provided to 2 specials schools to date.</p>  <p>  In making the decision to issue advanced capitation, my Department has had regard to a number of factors which have combined to create an insurmountable and unforeseeable financial challenge for  the special school.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the amount of capitation due to the special schools for 2019/20, the impact a full recoupment might have on the schools next year and their ability to meet other costs, methods of recoupment will be explored with each school individually.</p>  <p>  It is not sustainable however for my Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums. </p>  <p>  I know that this is a cause of concern to schools as well and it is my hope that a speedy and cost effective resolution can be secured for impacted special schools. </p></reply>

This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<i></i>A new 16 classroom primary school (to be established in September 2019) in Ashbourne and a new special school in Dublin 15 were also announced in 2019 bringing the overall total to 44.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I announced details of the structural remediation programme last week which has now commenced.</p><p>My Department regularly updates the current position on all projects on the school building programme and this information is available in county format on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie.</i></p></reply>

Kildare.  The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish 167 new special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year of which approximately 156 will be new ASD special classes. This includes 2 new primary ASD classes and 1 post-primary ASD class in Co.

This contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.</p><p>While progress has been made, some further issues remain to be addressed in the Kildare area. </p><p>A working group chaired by the NCSE and involving relevant sections of my Department has been convened to put in place a protocol to ensure that there is effective pro-active planning of specialist educational places for students in special classes and special schools.</p><p>The resulting protocol will clarify roles and responsibilities, provide for the exchange of data and information, identify timeframes and cover the short, medium and longer term.  </p><p>The protocol will support the operation of Section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 which empowers the Minister to direct a school to make additional provision for children with special educational needs. A protocol has been drafted and is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. This Policy Advice is to be completed and a report submitted to the Minister no later than June 2020.</p></reply>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 will see numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level. Over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  </p>  <p>  The 2018/19 school year saw an increase of over 6000 teaching posts in our schools compared to the 2015/16 school year.  </p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.3:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2017/18 school year.  </p>  <p>  Any additional improvement in the pupil teacher ratio would have to be considered as part of the annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.565.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500069#WRJ06400"><p>Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to support the creation of TUs as higher education institutes (HEIs) of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. These regional HEIs will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. As such, Government will prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided the enabling legislation in the Technological Universities Act 2018 for two or more IoTs to come together to seek TU status. The Technological Universities Act 2018 which was signed into law on 19 March 2018 provides the legal framework underpinning the process for establishment by two or more IoTs as a TU subject to a decision-making process contingent on the meeting of specified eligibility criteria and including assessment by an international advisory panel. The 2018 Act also sets out the functions and governance requirements for these new HEIs. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU. Section 38 of the Act provides that an institution and an established TU may also apply to the Minister for such an order.</p>  <p>  Government also continues to support those consortia of IoTs seeking to achieve TU status under the legislation in terms of significant Exchequer co-funding. Submissions from HEIs seeking funding under the  2019 call for proposals in respect of TU development and other higher education landscape restructuring projects, for which a total of &euro;14 million in Exchequer funding is being made available, are currently being evaluated by the Higher Education Authority before the Authority makes recommendations for funding allocations to the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression. The merging of institutes of technology will create institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise those benefits and attract greater investment. </p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of any proposals by DkIT to pursue TU status under the 2018 legislation currently and it is understood that at this time DkIT has not either joined or formed a consortium seeking to develop TU proposals.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.572.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500070#WRK00400"><p>As will be appreciated, the jurisdictions immediately concerned, while different, have had a very close relationship for historical and political reasons including within a shared common law heritage. The Law Society and the Bar of Ireland are, therefore, liaising with their Northern Ireland counterparts to maintain the current cross-border arrangements post-Brexit where this is feasible and legally permissible in accordance with EU and national law. However, it remains to be seen what form Brexit will ultimately take so that the relevant arrangements can be finalised.</p>  <p>Secondary legislation has been prepared by my Department under the relevant provisions of the Solicitors' Acts and in conjunction with the Council of the Law Society to ensure that the recognition of UK solicitors on a reciprocal basis in this jurisdiction can continue post-Brexit, including under a no deal scenario. Separately, the Bar of Ireland, whose bilateral recognition framework outside the current EU framework is non-statutory, is making similar arrangements for the reciprocal recognition of UK barristers under the relevant Codes and Rules. Under these efforts, forty-four Northern Ireland Barristers were called to the Irish Bar in March 2019 as part of a reciprocal call. Upwards of 2,772 solicitors from England and Wales have registered in this jurisdiction with the Law Society between January of 2016 and May of this year with applications continuing to be processed. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government on 3 January 2019, welcomed the Bar of Ireland and Law Society initiative "Promoting Ireland as a Leading Centre Globally for International Legal Services" as a further component of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Strategy. The joint initiative specifically recognises that there are substantial cross border opportunities for the &lsquo;all island&rsquo; market in legal services, particularly in the scenario where separate Brexit arrangements are contemplated for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed that this joint sectoral initiative be taken into consideration, as may be appropriate, for support under those measures being taken by the Government as part of its response to Brexit. At the same time it was agreed that, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I would facilitate the establishment of an appropriate Implementation Group to be chaired by a person of appropriate standing with the participation of all key stakeholders including Government Departments and IDA Ireland to support the effective realisation of the initiative. Steps are being taken in active consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society for the appointment of a Chair and the resourcing and launch of the Implementation Group along these lines. These ongoing actions by the legal professional bodies and the Government are an inherent recognition of the strategic importance of maintaining the smooth conduct of legal services and legal proceedings with Northern Ireland and those other jurisdictions directly affected by Brexit for the continued benefit of both private citizens and enterprise.</p></reply>

Coupled with an increase in the number of people applying for protection in recent years is the large number of people with an international protection status or a permission to remain who continue to live in RIA accommodation.  RIA has approximately the same number of persons with status living in its centres as it has applicants housed in emergency accommodation.  People with status or permission to remain have the same access to mainstream housing supports and services as nationals.  RIA is working intensively with the Peter McVerry Trust, Depaul and the PATHS project to assist these people to transition to mainstream housing services.</p>  <p>  As of 9th June 2019 there were 777 residents accommodated in 27 emergency accommodation locations.</p>  <p>  RIA endeavours to accommodate all international protection applicants who require accommodation initially at Balseskin Reception Centre. They will then be dispersed to a RIA accommodation centre or an emergency accommodation location.  </p>  <p>  The duration of stay in the emergency accommodation is intended to be for as short a time as possible prior to being transferred to a contracted RIA accommodation centre when places become available. Family composition, ages of children and medical needs are factors which are taken into account in determining the sequence of persons transferred to centres from emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Persons accommodated in emergency accommodation are provided with full board accommodation. SafetyNet, on behalf of the HSE, offers medical screening to those applicants who do not receive screening at Balseskin Reception Centre.  Additionally, the RIA is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist in the process of linking residents with local Community Welfare Services.  Staff from RIA are meeting with the residents in these locations to discuss any issues that may arise. In addition, RIA is seeking to contract a Visiting Support and Cultural Liaison Service from the NGO community by the end of this month to assist those residents during their time in the emergency accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Premises proposed for use as emergency accommodation facilities are inspected by RIA staff prior to opening, and their suitability is assessed, taking all necessary regulatory and legislative requirements into account. </p></reply>

Ireland, like many other open and democratic states, faces a threat from international terrorism.</p>  <p>  The expert assessment of the terrorist threat to Ireland is that, while an attack is possible, it is not considered likely. The authorities here remain nonetheless very vigilant and the level of threat is kept under constant and active review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda Authorities supported by the Defence Forces have in place robust response and prevention capabilities and the authorities here work continually with their international counterparts to identify and manage threats.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational need.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of the security arrangements in place, the Deputy can be assured that all measures necessary and consistent with the law will be taken to protect the State and the people from harm. Additionally, the Deputy should also be aware that community Garda&iacute; liaise proactively with minority groups from across all communities within the State, with a view to building trust and enhancing quality of life.  Indeed their swift response to reassure minorities following the Christchurch attacks was widely welcomed by the entire community. </p></reply>

Under the terms of that section, the common duty of care means a duty to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances (having regard to the care which a visitor may reasonably be expected to take for his or her own safety and, if the visitor is on the premises in the company of another person, the extent of the supervision and control the latter person may reasonably be expected to exercise over the visitor's activities) to ensure that a visitor to the premises does not suffer injury or damage by reason of any danger existing thereon.</p>  <p>  The issue of occupiers&rsquo; liability was considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group as reflected in Chapter 6 of its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance published in 2018.  The Report notes that the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995 draws a distinction between three categories of entrants, namely visitors, recreational users and trespassers.  Visitors are owed the greatest duty of care.  Visitors were the most relevant category of entrants for the purposes of the Working Group's Report as those present in a business premises tend to be customers of the occupier or to be other persons present at the occupier&rsquo;s invitation or by virtue of a contract. </p>  <p>  The Report notes that the Working Group, in considering this matter, reviewed relevant case law and found that there are many examples of cases which are dismissed on liability grounds as no evidence of negligence is put forward to substantiate the claim.  Accordingly, the Working Group, whose Legal Sub-Group also considered these matters, decided that it could not make a recommendation on the issue. At the same time, the Working Group considered that the insurance industry needs to give greater recognition to improvements made in health and safety practice by businesses by way of lower premiums where warranted.</p>  <p>  The duty of care imposed by section 3 of the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act is also a matter for the courts and was, for example, recently considered by the Court of Appeal (Byrne v Ardenheath Company Ltd.)  The Court of Appeal highlighted the need for the courts to bring ordinary common sense to bear on their assessment of what should amount to reasonable care and outlined various factors which may be considered by a trial judge when analysing whether an occupier may be said to have complied with his or her obligation to provide reasonable care for a visitor to its premises, including the probability of an accident occurring, the likely gravity of the injury that might result or the cost of eliminating the risk.</p>  <p>  The court stated that section 3(2) of the Occupiers Liability Act makes clear that the occupier is entitled, when deciding what steps it should take to comply with its obligation, to assume that its visitors will take all reasonable care for their own safety and the occupier is entitled to take into account that an adult normally can look after his or her welfare.</p>  <p>  Clearly, these are matters that deserve, and are being given, careful consideration and expression by way of balancing those rights conferred by law and protected under the Constitution, including as appropriate to the interests of the parties concerned and any duty of care that may arise. As such, they have been given detailed and balanced consideration by the Cost of Insurance Working Group and its Legal Sub-Group. They are also matters that are, as I have outlined, being taken into independent consideration by the judiciary in relevant proceedings before the courts. </p>  <p>   In addition, a range of actions are now being taken by the Government on foot of the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to more effectively prevent and penalise insurance fraud so as to provide additional protections for those who may owe a duty of care under the terms of the Occupiers Liability Act 1995.  There are no proposals, therefore, being considered by the Government at present to change the existing legislation in this area.</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Courts Service that one of the objectives of its provincial capital building programme is to provide improved court accommodation in Tralee.  This is one of a number of provincial city/county town venues nationwide still requiring new or upgraded courthouse accommodation.  Collectively, these venues will be the next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside the capital. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that it envisages a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities to include consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, and legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites designed to meet current and future needs in Tralee.  This will require a building significantly larger than the existing courthouse on Ashe Street where the scope for refurbishing and development is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site. </p>  <p>  A number of options for Tralee Courthouse are currently being considered including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site, and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow.  Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the purchase prices sought for relevant sites were such that they could not represent value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site, and I understand a number of potential sites are being considered.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised that discussions with Kerry County Council are ongoing regarding the future provision of court facilities in Tralee.  However, no decision has been made and all options are under review.</p></reply>

Under these Regulations, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I, as Minister have no direct role in the matter. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that all applicants must have a proven proficiency in two languages; one of which must be Irish or English. This requirement applies without discrimination to all candidates. Such competency may be proven by achieving the relevant grades in an Irish Leaving Certificate or for English or Irish through such assessments as set out by the Public Appointments Service. While two languages are required, applicants who do not possess proficiency in Irish but have a second language will be deemed eligible under the Regulations. </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda Trainees and I, as Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter. I have, however, been informed that PAS, which conducts tests as part of the competitive selection process, carefully considers all requests for reasonable accommodations.  In considering such requests, PAS is conscious of the rights of people with disabilities and of the obligations on it to observe those rights and to act in accordance with the provisions of the relevant equality legislation. </p>  <p>  As a public body established under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, PAS is also obliged under section 34(1)(b) of that Act to ensure that &ldquo;standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness&rdquo; apply to all of its recruitment and selection work.  These binding standards are set out in the Code of Practice for Appointment to Positions where the Garda Commissioner has Statutory Responsibility, as published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that in considering requests for reasonable accommodations, PAS has a fundamental duty to ensure it is being fair to all candidates who have entered a particular competition and that the key principle of appointment on merit is being observed.  To assist PAS in considering a request for accommodations in a fair and balanced way, its policy is to ask candidates to indicate on their application if they require special accommodations and to submit evidence in support of their request.  PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.  PAS has given additional time to people with dyslexia where they have supporting evidence. However, having made reasonable accommodations, candidates must reach the required standard in order to be considered for further progression in a competition. </p>  <p>  In December 2018 the Government endorsed the key recommendations contained within the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and published &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo; &ndash; the implementation plan for the Commission&rsquo;s report, this includes the recommendations in relation to the reform of recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to increase the diversity of the organisation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will agree that it is vital that the Commissioner continues to recruit candidates with the appropriate qualifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that best practice continues to be followed with regard to any such recruitment. I welcome and support the Commissioner&rsquo;s commitment to increasing the diversity of the members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reflect the twenty first century Ireland it serves. This will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains its strong bond with the diverse communities it serves. The recommendations of the Commission will take time to implement, and any proposal to amend the Recruitment and Admission regulations, including the language requirement will require consideration and consultation with a number of interested parties.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is not intended that a person with an Atypical permission would roll over their permission thus circumventing the work permit regime and for this reason the person concerned is required to leave the State at the end of their permission. </p>  <p>  The policy responsibility relating to the use of locum doctors in the Primary Care Sector is  primarily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE). The role of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is to provide immigration mechanisms by which non-EEA medical personnel may be recruited to fill temporary vacancies in the health sector as and when required. I am advised that there have been no amendments made to these terms since they were first published on the INIS website, in July 2015.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the current arrangements doctors undertaking locum work may be granted a &lsquo;block&rsquo; 90-day permission for the duration of their 90-day contract. Exit from and re-entry into the State is not permitted during this 90-day period. The terms of the Scheme also state that at least one month must elapse from the expiry date of the 90 day permission before a new application may be made.  </p>  <p>  All applicants for the Atypical Working Scheme are advised that they must allow a minimum of 20 working days for the processing of their application from date of receipt. The average processing time for all applications made under the Atypical Working Scheme are processed in accordance with this 20 working day commitment. In cases where an application is submitted containing incomplete, inaccurate or insufficient information, or when clarification of matters raised is required, delays to this processing time are inevitable while awaiting a response from an applicant.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure optimum use is made of the resources.</p><p>In 2017 the Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country.

In addition to the Roads Policing Units focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, they will also focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Divisional Roads Policing Units will work closely with other Divisional units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.</p><p>The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues.

For other sexual activity, section 14 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 applies. Under this section, it is not a defence to sexual assault on a person under 15 years of age that the person consented to the activity. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 introduced a &lsquo;proximity of age&rsquo; defence to the offence of engaging in a sexual act with a child under 17.

The study will entail two distinct pillars:</p><p>1. the provision of supports to families who are victims of familicide;</p><p>2. international best practice in the conduct of Domestic Homicide Reviews.</p><p>Ms. Norah Gibbons has been appointed to lead this independent study and is now been joined by practising Senior Counsel Grainne McMorrow and internationally recognised Forensic Criminologist Dr Jane Moncton Smith.  Their work will involve consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including State agencies, family members of victims and non-governmental organisations.  A public advertisement was placed in the national newspapers recently calling for interested parties to make submissions to the study by 31 July.  I encourage all interested parties who can assist the work of this study to make a submission which can be done by e-mail to <i>info@fsdhr.ie. </i></p><p>The second pillar of the study will address the issue of domestic homicide reviews.  Domestic Homicide Reviews have taken place for a number of years in other jurisdictions.  The study will draw on peer related research and consult family members of victims, experts, NGOs and state agencies.  It will also consult other agencies/organisations with experience of domestic homicide reviews in comparable foreign jurisdictions.  International best practice will be identified and recommendations made in relation to their application to this jurisdiction. </p><p>Moreover I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that, in the context of the categorisation and recording of homicides, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a review of the investigation of certain homicides which includes a number of domestic homicides.  I have also been informed that, separately to this, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing policies and procedures to inform the overall policing approach to domestic homicides.  This includes a Domestic Homicide Review Team in the Garda National Protective Services Bureau examining a small number of domestic homicides of relevance for review.  The purpose of such reviews is to serve as a lessons learned review to facilitate better practice in the approach to domestic abuse.  This practice will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in seeking to continuously improve their approach to domestic abuse. </p><p>Finally, I would also like to advise the Deputy that significant reforms have and continue to be advanced over the last number of years by the Government in making the criminal justice system a more victim responsive one.  This includes the introduction of a wide range of victim oriented legislation including the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and organisational reforms taken across the respective criminal justice agencies aimed at better supporting victims of crime.</p></reply>

Its occupancy, as of 9 June 2019, was 294 persons.  A new residential block is under construction in this reception centre and when construction has been completed in mid-July, the capacity of the centre will increase to 487.  The additional capacity is necessary to respond to the increased number of persons claiming international protection.   </p>  <p>  A new, purpose-built health facility will open in the reception centre in the coming weeks and will be to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities.  The facility provides much-needed additional space and will accommodate a primary care team that includes nurses, doctors and psychologists.  The facility will allow the health care team to address health issues while also accommodating infection control measures in an efficient manner.  In addition, the facility will allow the HSE and others to provide group interventions.  Visiting outside clinicians can also be facilitated in the new health facility.</p></reply>

Unlike a refugee, a person with non-protection permission to remain does not have an entitlement to be issued with a travel document, and such a document would be issued solely on a discretionary basis.  Applications are examined on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  It appears that information has been proffered to the Deputy which was not made available to INIS at the time this person&rsquo;s application for a discretionary document was being considered.  The deputy may wish to note that the refusal issued on this application extends to that application only.  The applicant is free to apply for a travel document again, and any future application will be examined on its merits. In any future application, the person would be advised to submit information on the rescinding of his or her refugee status by the relevant authorities, and provide any relevant residence permission letters issued by this Department, as required by the travel document application form. </p>  <p>  More generally, queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Although the provisions of the Directive are already largely transposed into national law under existing legislation, the 2019 Bill will update Part 6 of the 2001 Act through updated definitions of offences, officials who are subject to the Act and the &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; aspect of the Directive&rsquo;s requirements.  It also addresses the liability of legal persons in the context of relevant offences. </p>  <p>  The second Bill that will amend the 2001 Act is the proposed Criminal Justice (Counterfeiting) Bill 2019, the General Scheme for which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks, and will be made publically available thereafter on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This Bill will transpose Directive (EU) 2014/62 and give effect to three EU technical instruments for the improved monitoring and detection of counterfeit euros.  The 2014 Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of counterfeiting of the euro and other currencies.  The Directive requires the creation of criminal offences of making, uttering, importing counterfeit currency and possessing instruments and security features for making counterfeits.  It is considered that the provisions on counterfeiting in Part 5 of the 2001 Act meet most of the requirements of the 2014 Directive.  However, it is necessary to make a number of amendments to Part 5 of the 2001 Act to fully transpose the 2014 Directive and the associated technical instruments.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above amendments to the 2001 Act, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2019 contains a minor amendment to section 52 of the 2001 Act which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request records in an electronic (or any other) format where necessary.  The General Scheme of this Bill is available from my Department's website, having been approved by the Government in January this year.  It is expected to be brought before the Houses in the Autumn.</p>  <p>  Finally, officials within my Department are currently considering the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s 2018 Report on Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences insofar as the recommendations of that report pertain to the 2001 Act.</p></reply>

This 9 month period is to allow for the progress of the independent specialist in-depth research study on familicide and domestic homicide reviews, led by Ms Norah Gibbons.  This study will examine provisions and supports in respect to familicide and the introduction of domestic homicide reviews.  The study will also examine in a comprehensive and independent way the experience of such reviews operating elsewhere.

This will comprise a series of regional competitions through the Government's procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Department ran a tender competition for premises within 40km of Newbridge, Co. Kildare for accommodation and ancillary services.  Successful bidders were required to undertake mobilisation works to provide for cooking facilities for residents,  a foodhall (where residents can procure ingredients and food items as well as toiletries and household items through a points system) and provide designated living space for families outside of the bedrooms.  There is a 12 week provision for the completion of the required mobilisation works.  No contract will be in effect until the mobilisation works are completed and subsequently inspected and verified as complete by RIA.</p>  <p>  The provider who is currently providing accommodation and ancillary services at the Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin, Co. Kildare was successful in being placed on the framework.  The 12 week mobilisation period commenced on the 11th April 2019 which requires all works to be complete by the 4th July 2019. </p>  <p>  The contract is for an initial 2 year period and can be extended twice on a mutually agreeable basis for a year each time.  The agreed capacity is for 143 persons and the centre will be used to accommodate a mix of families and single persons.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, the employment permits system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy led system.   </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills Occupations List and the Ineligible Occupations List for the purposes of granting an employment permit.  The Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process and involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by DBEI and which includes the Department of Health.  </p>  <p>  Healthcare assistants and Homecare workers are currently on the Ineligible Occupations List and in order to have an occupation removed from the ineligible list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary evidence to substantiate their claims.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the most recent review, the roles of Healthcare Assistant and Homecare workers were not proposed for amendment at this time.  The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, in this case, the Department of Health, are an important part of the decision-making process.  Officials of that Department have advised the sector of the need for further evidence, demonstrating genuine efforts to recruit across the EEA.  In particular the sector needs to engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social protection who have responsibility for EURES the (European Employment Services), and who are well positioned to help sectors to recruit from within the EEA.  </p>  <p>  The mid-year Review  of the Occupational Lists has now commenced, and a public consultation is underway, with a closing date of 12th July.  Interested parties are invited to make submissions relating to the skills and labour supply in their sector of interest, using the submission form posted for this purpose on my Department's website.</p></reply>

It is my understanding that, despite planning permission having been secured, there was limited interest from Agency clients for the site in question.  Coupled with budgetary demands elsewhere, this resulted in the physical development being paused, although the lands continued to be marketed by the IDA to potential investors.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I am informed that the IDA has now commissioned an updated assessment of this land bank with respect to its investment potential.  A revised planning application is currently being considered as part of this assessment.</p>  <p>  It is positive that planning permission was previously secured on this site and it is helpful to the Agency in their ongoing efforts to showcase its potential to investors.  The IDA continues to actively market this site, together with the wider area, to clients that may be interested in expanding or locating in County Mayo.   </p>  <p>  The pipeline for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Mayo remains positive.  In 2018 there was a 7.5% increase in employment by IDA client companies with 344 net new jobs added.  The IDA has also recently secured a tenant for an Advanced Technology Building (ATB) that was constructed in Castlebar as part of the Agency's Regional Property Programme.  The decision by the firm in question to locate in that ATB, and thereby create 150 jobs in Castlebar, demonstrates the area's potential and its attractiveness to overseas investors.</p></reply>

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit.  While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>Brexit is my top priority at this time and was central to my decision-making on the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. </p><p>For example, I provided an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme.  I also provided extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.</p><p>Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding has been increased by 22% in 2019, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating.  The LEOs, which have a presence in every county, are working with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally.  This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets.  This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness.  I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 01 March last and a second call of the scheme opened on 19 June.  Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.</p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.  ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  In March, it launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with InterTradeIreland paying 50% of total expenditure.  This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in April of this year.

This trend is continuing, with a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in the County over the past number of years.  There are currently 169 IDA client companies in Cork, employing approximately 39,000 people.</p>  <p>  Under its current 'Winning' Strategy, the IDA is seeking to increase FDI in Cork and the South West region by 30% to 40% over the period 2015-2019.  This approach has been delivering results and between 2017 and 2018 alone, employment in IDA client companies in Cork increased by over 5% with 2,087 net new foreign direct investment-supported jobs added in the County.  There have also been a number of recent significant recent job announcements by IDA clients including 400 jobs at VoxPro, 200 positions at Deutsche Borse Group and 100 new jobs at Forcepoint. </p>  <p>  The IDA is currently in the process of formulating a new five-year strategy covering the period 2020-2024 which will take account of the National Planning Framework under Project Ireland 2040, as well as the Regional Spatial Economic Strategy and Cork Metropolitan Area Strategic Plans.  </p>  <p>  It is clear, not least from the County's recent performance over the last number of years, that Cork has a robust enterprise base and remains a highly attractive destination for overseas companies.  Work will nevertheless continue, by both the enterprise agencies and the Government, to help ensure it continues to attract further investment.</p></reply>

The maximum grant payable once to an individual in any three year period, was &euro;5,020.  Previous recipients of the grant who wished to be considered for a further grant, had to re-apply for consideration.  The grant did not roll-over on an automatic basis.</p>  <p>  Prior to the closure of the Motorised Transport Grant scheme in February 2013, approximately 300 persons per annum qualified for a grant, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.3 million per annum.  No further grants have been paid under this scheme since its closure in 2013.</p>  <p>  With regard to the proposals for a new Health (Transport Support) Bill, the Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health and I, brought a Memorandum to Government on proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled, particularly for clinically urgent procedures.  </p><p>While every effort is made to avoid cancellation or postponement of planned procedures, the HSE advise that planned procedures and operations can be postponed or cancelled for a variety of reasons including capacity issues due to increased scheduled and unscheduled care demand, medical reasons, and patient choice. </p><p>The HSE has advised my Department that four scheduled surgeries were cancelled at University Hospital Waterford (UHW) on the 14 of June 2019. The HSE further advise that as of 7am on Friday 14<sup></sup>of June last, there were 31 admitted patients in the Emergency Department and 8 extra patients on trolleys at ward level at the hospital. As the demand for critical care beds already exceeded what was available on that day there was no critical care capacity available or likely to be available for patients that would require post-operative specialist critical care that day.</p><p>As a result, and in line with the hospital&rsquo;s escalation policy, the HSE has advised that four scheduled surgeries were cancelled.  The HSE has further advised that the patients will be contacted urgently to reschedule their appointments.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that increasing capacity across our hospitals is a priority for Government. An additional 241 acute hospital beds opened under the Winter Initiative 2017/2018, including 18 additional acute beds in Waterford University Hospital.  Furthermore, the National Service Plan for 2019 provides for a comprehensive capacity programme and as part of that programme, an additional 6 acute beds have opened this year in UHW under the 2018/2019 Winter Plan. </p><p>The 2019 capacity programme also provides for 202 additional beds, including 24 beds in UHW during 2019 with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in Q1 of 2020.</p><p>In relation to the specific procedures that were cancelled by the hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p><p>The impact is particularly notable when one considers the improvements to the Waiting Lists for those particular specialties which were the focus of the Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan in 2018. These include the numbers waiting over 3 months for a Cataract procedure which fell by 55% from July 2017 to the end of December 2018; the numbers waiting 3 months for a tonsillectomy fell by 65% in the same period; and angiograms fell by 50%.</p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March.</p><p>Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes: </p><p>- Detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments. </p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000; </p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000; </p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p><p>A key element of the Scheduled Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List.  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments.</p><p>The plan also includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years.</p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>The IPDC &amp;amp; Outpatient data requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables.  In relation to the specific question of the steps being taken to reduce the waiting lists at University Hospital Limerick, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.  </p><p>University Hospital Limerick IPDC Waiting List<table><tr><th>0-3 mths</th><th>3-6 mths</th><th>6-9 mths</th><th>9-12 mths</th><th>12-15 mths</th><th>15-18 mths</th><th>18-24 mths </th><th>24-36 mths</th><th>36-48 mths</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>865</td><td>388</td><td>292</td><td>155</td><td>103</td><td>75</td><td>72</td><td>59</td><td>2</td><td>2011</td></tr></table></p><p>University Hospital Limerick Outpatient Waiting List<table><tr><th>0-3 mths</th><th>3-6 mths</th><th>6-9 mths</th><th>9-12 mths</th><th>12-15 mths</th><th>15-18 mths</th><th>18-21 mths </th><th>21-24 mths</th><th>24-36 mths</th><th>36-48 mths</th><th>48+</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>8696</td><td>4958</td><td>4614</td><td>3584</td><td>2826</td><td>1779</td><td>1730</td><td>1567</td><td>3899</td><td>881</td><td>154</td><td>34688<br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The risk reduction measures recommended by the EMA on foot of its previous review in 2014 were fully implemented in Ireland; prior to this, there were no specific restrictions over and above those listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet for healthcare professionals and the patient information leaflet. As with any medicine, these documents were regularly updated as new data emerged about the medicine and its potential side effects. </p>  <p>  The HSE's Valproate Response Project is expected to be completed within the coming weeks, and a final report will be submitted to my Department upon completion of the project. Once that report is received and reviewed in the Department, I will give further consideration as to whether an inquiry is appropriate.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;10m provided last year, has funded twelve new respite houses.  That&rsquo;s one in each HSE CHO area, plus an additional three houses in the Greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite from this area.  These twelve additional houses are providing additional respite for families that need it.  This year, the HSE will also fund a number of alternative respite services.  These are practical and important solutions, such as summer camps, evening and Saturday clubs, benefitting hundreds of adults and children. </p></reply>

The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March.</p><p>Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:</p><p>- detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes; and 40,000 outpatient first appointments.</p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;</p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;</p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including hip and knee replacements, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p><p>Regarding the data on hip replacements requested by the deputy, please note that Merlin Park Hospital does not have an active waiting list as those patients are captured under the Galway University Hospital (GUH) waiting list. The GUH Hip Replacement Waiting List is contained in the document attached.</p><p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It increased by  125 whole time equivalents to 3,121 in the year to the end of May 2019.</p>  <p>  The public health service in Ireland operates in a global market for medical specialists where there is a world-wide shortage of specialists.  Notwithstanding this shortage, progress continues to be made in attracting and retaining consultants and in addressing improvements in the training, working environment and career pathways for Non Consultant Hospital Doctors in Ireland to encourage the supply of future consultant candidates.</p>  <p>  The issue of new entrant pay is being addressed in general terms under the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The issue has also been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission in relation to consultants.  The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties in regard to recruitment of consultants.  The Commission also acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants.  It did not view the measures announced last September for new entrant public servants generally, as being sufficient to address the degree of pay differential which exists for Consultants.</p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of consultants. However, brokering an affordable solution will be a significant challenge, in particular within the context of budgetary pressures and broader public sector policy.</p></reply>

In return for cooperation with a wide range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over the next 4 years.</p>  <p>  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease management programme. There will also be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments.  The Agreement also provides for additional Practice Nurse hours equating to 247 WTE Practice Nurses to facilitate the roll-out of the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these new measures will benefit patients and help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p></reply>

These include: </p><p>-  cystic fibrosis</p><p>-  congenital hypothyroidism</p><p>-  phenylketonuria</p><p>-  classical galactosaemia</p><p>-  MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency)</p><p>-  Homocystinuria</p><p>-  maple syrup urine disease</p><p>-  glutaric aciduria type 1 </p><p>The most recent expansion of the programme occurred on 3 December 2018 when screening for Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD) and Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 (GA1) commenced.</p><p>As per recommendation 5, contained within the Scally Review (2018), a National Screening Committee will be established and become operational before the end of 2019. This is to strengthen the governance, transparency and oversight of any proposed new programmes or changes to existing programmes. Similar to the UK National Screening Committee, the Committee&rsquo;s role will be to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p><p>- Interviews for the role of Chairperson took place on 10<sup></sup>June 2019 and I expect to receive a recommendation for appointment this week  </p><p>- The remaining positions on the NSC will be filled by Expressions of Interest throughout June -  August 2019.</p><p>Any future potential changes to the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme will be incorporated as part of the Committee's immediate work programme. Ireland, very much like the UK has always evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against the international accepted criteria &ndash; collectively known as the Wilson Junger criteria. The evidence bar for commencing a screening programme should and must remain high.  This ensures that we can be confident that the programme is effective, quality assured and operating as safe as possible. </p></reply>

It was submitted by the HSE to my Department on 13 May 2019 and is currently receiving consideration.  The Report was prepared in response to requests I and my Department made to the HSE asking that it address the issues raised in the Judgement of Justice Kelly mentioned in the media reports and broader issues relating to medical recruitment. </p>  <p>  While the number of consultants has increased by 109 in the 12 months to the end of April 2019 and by 509 in the past five years, the Government is aware that there are significant difficulties in filling certain consultant posts, particularly in smaller hospitals, though not exclusively, and in a number of specialties, as identified by the Public Sector Pay Commission.  The Commission in its Report published on 4 September 2018 identified difficulties in attracting consultant applications for many posts at present and acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this. </p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential.  The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed.  The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of consultants.  However, brokering an affordable solution will be a significant challenge, in particular within the context of budgetary pressures and broader public sector policy.</p></reply>

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures.  As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.  This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure.  The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p><p>The impact is particularly notable when one considers the improvements to the Waiting Lists for those particular specialties which were the focus of the Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan in 2018.  These include the numbers waiting over 3 months for a tonsillectomy procedure which fell by 65% from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. </p><p>Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:</p><p>- detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments.</p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;</p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;</p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p><p>A key element of the Scheduled Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments.</p><p>The plan also includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019.  This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years.</p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures.  This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>The data requested by deputy on the number of children on IPDC &amp;amp; Outpatient waiting lists in CHO Area 8 is outlined in the following document.</p><p>IPDC Total Children Waiting in CHO Area 8 by Time Band as at 30/05/2019<table><tr><th>Area of Residence</th><th>0-3 Months</th><th>3-6 Months</th><th>6-9 Months</th><th>9-12 Months</th><th>12-18 Months</th><th>18 Months +</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>31</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>14</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>44</td><td>29</td><td>28</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>86</td><td>35</td><td>33</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>13</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>36</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>12</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>49</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>9</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>258</td><td>145</td><td>142</td><td>70</td><td>83</td><td>66</td><td>764</td></tr></table></p><p>OP Total Child Waiters in CHO Area 8 by Wait Time Band as at 30/05/2019<table><tr><th>Area of Residence</th><th>0-3 Months</th><th>3-6 Months</th><th>6-9 Months</th><th>9-12 Months</th><th>12-18 Months</th><th>18 Months +</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>520</td><td>393</td><td>233</td><td>139</td><td>187</td><td>448</td><td>1920</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>253</td><td>162</td><td>99</td><td>39</td><td>98</td><td>213</td><td>864</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>730</td><td>529</td><td>360</td><td>180</td><td>279</td><td>446</td><td>2524</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1126</td><td>722</td><td>451</td><td>328</td><td>490</td><td>786</td><td>3903</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>557</td><td>369</td><td>189</td><td>133</td><td>205</td><td>488</td><td>1941</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>523</td><td>320</td><td>222</td><td>145</td><td>195</td><td>451</td><td>1856</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>3709</td><td>2495</td><td>1554</td><td>964</td><td>1454</td><td>2832</td><td>13008</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In relation to health needs, HSE Disability Services provide personal and social supports based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific diagnosis or condition. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to publish a plan for advancing neuro-rehabilitation services in the community. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive recently published its implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.  This was the culmination of the work of the National Steering Group established in 2017, which included representation from stakeholder groups including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The focus of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is on achieving best outcomes for people, by providing safe, high quality, person-centred care at the lowest appropriate level of complexity.  This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary. </p>  <p>  The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework.  It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step.  The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services. </p>  <p>  The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey. </p>  <p>  The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:</p>  <p>  - Acute hospital;</p>  <p>  - Complex specialist rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Community based specialist rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Primary care; and</p>  <p>  - Voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs.  It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services.  It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation.  The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021.  However, it is recognised that continued investment in and development of neuro-rehabilitation services will need to be prioritised beyond the three-year implementation period of this Implementation Framework. </p></reply>

One of the schemes will support evidence-based approaches to mobilising community action on alcohol. Both schemes will have a fund of &euro;250,000 on a multi-annual basis.</p>  <p>  It is intended that both schemes will be developed  in the second half of 2019.</p>  <p>  On 6th March 2019, I announced additional funding of &euro;1 million for the implementation of the national drugs strategy. This funding, which will be provided on a recurring, multi-annual basis, will address the priorities set down in the strategy including early harm reduction responses to  emerging trends in substance misuse, and improving access to services for people with complex needs. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of the outcome of a consultation process with task forces and community healthcare organisations, I approved a three-strand funding model for this additional funding. Task forces were notified of this funding model on 17 May. A series of regional workshops took place in June outlining the details of scheme and the application process for this funding. </p>  <p>  I am committed to implementing an integrated public health response to substance misuse, with the twin aims of reducing harm and supporting recovery.

At the end of 2018, the HSE's DIME system reported, for filled posts,1,690 Type B clinical contracts, 289 Type B*s and 156 Type C's. </p>  <p>  The volume of private practice allowed for under Consultant Contract 2008 is, typically, limited to 20%.

Consequently, the HSE has decided to extend the existing review of Winter 2018/2019 to include a review by an independent expert group. The group will carry out a comparative analysis of unscheduled care performance across the nine hospital sites and the relevant Community Healthcare Organisations that were the subject of specific focused support through Winter 2018/2019. This will include University Hospital Limerick as one of the nine focus sites.</p>  <p>  The independent expert group includes external clinical and management expertise from NHS Scotland, and domain knowledge and data analysis and expertise from the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. The HSE will provide facilitation and support to the review team. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference and membership of the group have been agreed and preliminary performance data collection has been undertaken and shared with the independent members to enable early analysis in advance of potential site visits. The HSE advise that two meetings of the review group members have taken place to agree the overall requirements and work plan, with the next meeting planned for early July. </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that Government approved plans to proceed with the general scheme of a bill and officials are working on the heads of this comprehensive amending bill which will legislate for the recommendations of the Review. </p>  <p>  Draft heads of Bill are currently being finalised and will be submitted to the Mental Health Commission within the next two weeks for their detailed review. It is essential that the Mental Health Commission, which has a very significant and important role in overseeing the safeguards provided in the Act, has full input into the framing of the many amendments to be included in revised mental health legislation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that since the Expert Group Review was published three mental health amendment acts have been enacted.  </p>  <p>  The first was the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2015 which updated the provisions of the 2001 Act regarding treatment, in particular ECT.  </p>  <p>  The second was the more recent enactment of the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 which makes changes to the 2001 Act regarding the definition of voluntary patient and which introduces guiding principles for adults replacing the principle of best interests. The Act also introduces guiding principles for children and refers to capacity within the meaning of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. It is important to point out, however, that the provisions of the 2018 amending act cannot be commenced until further legislative changes are made and the Decision Support Service, established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is operational.  The changes in these two acts are based on a number of different recommendations of the Expert Group Review. </p>  <p>  The third amending act is the Mental Health (Renewal Orders) Act 2018, which amended Section 15 of the 2001 Act following on from a Court of Appeal finding of unconstitutionality.  </p>  <p>  In addition, changes to, or that have an effect on, the 2001 Act will be introduced as part of the new Deprivation of Liberty provisions currently being developed by my Department and also through changes proposed for the Child Care Act 1991.  Finally, there are four Private Member's Bills published which seek to make changes to or that have an effect on the 2001 Act.  As these bills are moved in the Oireachtas, my Department is required to prioritise these over other legislative work such as the review of the Act.</p>  <p>  Many of the changes proposed in the various private members bills replicate recommendations of the Expert Group Review.</p></reply>

My Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. The cost of applying the change to existing residents who will qualify from the coming into effect of the provisions has been factored into the overall cost of this proposed legislative change.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill  for the NHSS was approved by Government at Cabinet on the 11th June 2019. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. I intend to progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. </p></reply>

Pending receipt of finalised financial plans which will manage the staffing levels back to affordable numbers, on 29 March the Health Service Executive put in place measures and controls regarding recruitment.  </p>  <p>  - A reporting and monitoring structure around agreed savings targets in the National Service Plan, with responsible managers providing a monthly report commencing in respect of Quarter 1.  </p>  <p>  - A mid-year review of the Health Service Executives performance on savings and staffing limits with further interventions to follow, if necessary.  </p>  <p>  - The establishment of a new HSE Board governance structure, with strong competencies across key areas, will further contribute to strengthening the oversight and performance of the HSE pending its further reorganisation. The recent appointment of a CEO to the Health Service Executive will also strengthen the HSE&rsquo;s leadership and focus on performance. In fact, the development and implementation of an effective performance management and accountability system in the HSE has been identified by me as one of the priority issues for the new Board.  </p>  <p>  The National Service Plan requires the HSE to protect and promote the health and well-being of the population, having regard to the resources available to it, and making the most efficient and effective use of those resources. Implementation of the Service Plan is ongoing and my Department understands that the position of the HSE is that protection of front line service delivery is it's priority. The legislation (Health Act 2004, as amended) does provide for me to direct the HSE to submit an amended service plan if necessary.  </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging in ongoing dialogue with both the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the financial performance of the Health Service Executive year to date, including consideration of the projected outturn for the year.  </p>  <p>  These discussions are ongoing and until they are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to anticipate the outcome. </p></reply>

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. </p><p>As a result of continued investment and the work undertaken as part of the Scheduled Care Access Plan, the number of patients waiting for cataract procedures has fallen by 44% from a high of 10,024 in July 2017 to 5,655 at the end of May 2019. For the same period the number of patients waiting more than 9 months has fallen by 89% from 4,371 to 481.  The numbers waiting for hip and knee replacements has also reduced by 18%, while the number of patients waiting longer than 9 months has fallen by 69% from 1,019 in July 2019, to 319 at the end of May 2019. </p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>The specific data requested by the deputy is outlined in the attached documents.</p></reply>

The rare diseases committee recommendation was clearly targeted at the youngest and most severely affected SMA patients, and this group is the clear priority for the HSE.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-25a.1307.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500079#WRT06900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  However, it is undoubtedly important that the medical card application system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, especially arrangements relating to the issuing of medical cards on a discretionary basis. To that end, the HSE has sought to implement revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications. Such measures include the development of a Burden of Illness Questionnaire which is now being rolled out in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's National Medical Card Unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship.</p>  <p>  In addition, in January 2018 a new streamlined online medical card application system was launched. This enables applicants to find out immediately if they are eligible for a medical card and brings considerable benefits for people in terms of turnaround times, convenience and security. This measures aid the HSE's National Medical Card Unit to provide an enhanced service to applicants ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible. </p>  <p>   With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years.</p>  <p>  While it is none the less important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assessment, I do recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently. The processes in place by the HSE in granting an emergency medical card, the online application system and the Burden of Illness Questionnaire are aiding the National Medical Card Unit to provide an enhanced service to applicants ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible.</p></reply>

It provides supports which assist older people to live independently in their own homes for longer and enables large numbers of people to return home following acute hospital admission who otherwise would remain in hospital or would be admitted to long stay residential care.</p>  <p>  Many more of our older people with complex care needs are now being maintained at home, leading to increased demand for additional levels of service, and for services outside of core hours of Monday to Friday.  It is crucial that we develop homecare services and we are working to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people.  The Department is currently developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services.  The Scheme will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence. This approach is fully aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare, Ireland&rsquo;s vision for healthcare reform over the next 10 years which, at its core, recognises the importance of shifting care to the community to provide care closer to home and allow people to remain living in their communities for as long as possible. The Scheme is a key deliverable under the Department&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and has a target date of 2021. </p>  <p>  Work is also currently being progressed in relation to a review of the management, operation and funding of current homecare services in Ireland. This review is a commitment under the Programme for Partnership Government and will provide a baseline for the design of an effective, sustainable service as part of the development of a statutory homecare scheme. The review will look at various matters relating to the management and operation of the service, including the proportion of the funding allocated to direct service-provision by the HSE and the methodology for the allocation of funding to service-providers through the HSE&rsquo;s tendering processes, and how this relates to the funding of direct service-provision by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Given the nature of the role of the Home Care Support Assistant, (formerly known as a "Home Help"), these have always been very locally recruited, with a Home Help Manager matching and coordinating staff with clients, dependent on the number of hours and level of support both available from the worker and required by the client. The HSE keeps under review the position regarding the number of HCSA staff employed having regard to the hours available and the hours worked by existing staff in the local area.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May 2018.</p>  <p>  The strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies. This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and primary care teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the strategy. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Additional projects have been funded by the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  A large scale external evaluation of the strategy is nearing completion, and will be published in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The Department is committed to the full implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, and will continue to work with the National Dementia Office and stakeholders to progress the actions contained in the strategy. Until satisfactory work has been completed on actions contained in the current strategy, and because the external evaluation of the strategy has not concluded, it would not be appropriate to begin work on a new strategy.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published last September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide. Earlier this year, the HSE confirmed that it would continue to fund the Dementia Adviser service at existing levels in future years.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2020 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has now completed its report and the Steering Group has completed its consideration of it. The Report was submitted to the Department in June 2019. It is now being reviewed by my officials and any recommendations included in the report will be considered before publication of the report - I then expect to publish the report shortly.</p></reply>

The fund is worth &euro;6.14 billion and its aim is to invest in the maritime economy and support fishing communities. This item was held in public session.  The new EMFF is part of the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027, the new EU long-term budget that enters into force on 1 January 2021.</p>  <p>  - The Commission communication on the state of play of the Common Fisheries Policy and consultation on the fishing opportunities for 2020. The discussion is part of the process for reaching agreement on TACs and quotas at the December Council.</p>  <p>  - Post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy reform package: progress report.  The Council discussed in public session, the Romanian Presidency progress report on the work carried out in the Council and its preparatory bodies on all the Commission proposals of the CAP reform package, which includes regulations on CAP strategic plans, financing, management and monitoring of the CAP, and the common organisation of agricultural products.  Under this item, the Spanish Minister informed Council of the outcome of the CAP Green Architecture post-2020 Congress "Digging deeper into Eco-Schemes", which was held in Spain at the end of May.</p>  <p>  In addition, under Any Other Business, the Lithuanian delegation provided an update on the scientific advice recently published by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) on the state of the cod stock in the Eastern Baltic Sea.</p>  <p>  While Brexit was not discussed at Council, I have discussed the impact it will have on our agri-food sector on many occasions with my Ministerial colleagues.   Minister Doyle did however, reference, the potential impact a Mercosur trade deal will have on our beef sector, and called on the EU to remain vigilant as the negotiations progress, with a view to protecting the EU agriculture sector as much as possible.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States were invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation (CMO) Management Committee, the Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and was not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content. The regulation was passed by the CMO committee last week and will now be enacted.

Detailed statistics are available including amounts of outstanding loans, growth rates, new lending and interest rates on outstanding amounts. The total amount outstanding at the end of 2018 was &euro;3,144 million, down from a recent high of &euro;3,945 million in 2013. This quarterly analysis does not include data on distressed loans. However, a &ldquo;Financial Stability Note&rdquo; published last week by the Central Bank entitled &ldquo;A vulnerability analysis of Irish SME credit exposures&rdquo; noted that while Agriculture, Forestry &amp;amp; Fishing was the largest lending sector in the SME category (at 21.5%), it had a relatively low vulnerability to default.</p><p>The Teagasc National Farm Survey examines issues such as the level of debt on Irish farms, providing valuable information on trends in the sector.

There are a number of considerations that are taken into account when assessing an application for forestry licences, and I would like to take this opportunity to outline these to you.</p><p><b>General Guidelines and Assessments</b></p><p>All forestry licence applications undergo a comprehensive vetting process to ensure that inter alia the landscape, environment and our archaeological heritage are protected.  Every application is treated on its own merits and is examined with regard to its effect, if any, on its surroundings.  There are a number of guideline documents, such as Forestry and Water Quality Guidelines; Forestry and the Landscape Guidelines; which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Further, the Code of Best Forest Practice is a listing of all forestry operations and the manner in which they should be carried out to ensure the requirements for Sustainable Forest Management in Ireland are maintained.</p><p>Since the commencement in May 2017 of the Forestry Act, 2014, applications must be advertised to provide for 30 days public consultation.  The public consultation process is assisted by the erection of site notices for all afforestation and forest road works licence applications.  </p><p>A registered forester must complete an application for all afforestation, forest road works or aerial fertilisation licences.  Applications for tree felling licences are accepted from private individuals or registered foresters and other agents.  Applications are accepted throughout the year.  An application may be commenced but will not be finalised until certain mandatory documents are received and acknowledged.  It is at this point that the application is considered complete and advertised on my Department&rsquo;s website.  There is an average of 30 days between when an application is started and advertised. </p><p>In addition to this, referrals may be made to the local authority, Inland Fisheries Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and An Taisce depending on the specific characteristics of the site concerned.  These can include its proximity to water courses, designated European sites, or sensitive landscapes as defined by the local authority.  Where an application wholly or partly falls within a designated site, no decision may be made until an opinion is received from NPWS. </p><p>I am aware that the introduction of the independent Forestry Appeals Committee, the associated appeals process and more complex Appropriate Assessment requirements have resulted in increased processing timeframes for forestry licences.  In recognition of this and of the complexity involved, training both internally and with registered foresters took place in January and April this year.  I anticipate that this training will, among other things, lead to an improvement in the quality of initial applications and lands being put forward for consideration, as this is so important in terms of processing time.</p><p>I know there have been delays issuing licences due to archaeological and ecology issues. Additional resources have been provided to undertake the archaeological review with two new archaeologists employed; significant work has been done to clear backlogs arising for this reason.  In terms of ecology, the recruitment process for a new ecologist will shortly commence with a view to putting resources in place to meet the increased demand.  Furthermore, parallel referral processes have been put in place in order that both the forestry inspector and the specialist archaeologist/ecologist may view a file at the same time; this is expected to lead to more timely communication with applicants where additional information is required. </p><p>Refinements have been recently introduced to the Department's mapping tool which may reduce the number of cases referred to archaeology. My officials have also  issued a circular to registered foresters and other stakeholders encouraging the submission of  Harvest Plan with tree felling applications; this will form part of the assessment itself, will be taken into account as part of the Appropriate Assessment process and could lead to a speedier assessment process.</p><p><b>Licence Applications</b></p><p>The following tables show the afforestation and forest road works licence applications received for the years indicated (*to 31st May 2019).  This is the most accurate information available since the Forestry Act, 2014 was commenced in 2017, when the application process changed.

Afforestation has a significant role to play in mitigation particularly, through carbon sequestration.  Under current rules agreed as part of the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, forestry can contribute some 2.1 million tonnes of CO2 per annum of carbon towards Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets under the next climate mitigation period 2021-2030. Planting achieved under successive afforestation programmes will contribute to this  emissions reductions figure.  The Climate Action Plan now sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares of new planting  per year.  In addition, the land use sector will provide a total of 0.58 million tonnes of CO2 per annum over the period 2021-2030.</p>  <p>  While this will mostly yield benefits in the longer term post-2030, it will also contribute to our 2030 target through carbon sequestration.  Achieving these levels of afforestation will be challenging, as recent trends have not delivered new planting at this rate.  I am, however, committed to meeting this challenge through the continued provision of generous grants and premiums, engagement with a range of stakeholders from farmers to public bodies, a dedicated promotion and communication campaign, and by examining ways in which farm forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP.  Knowledge transfer programmes and other initiatives which raise awareness of the economic and eco system benefits of forestry will continue to play an important role in tackling some of the barriers to planting.</p>  <p>  An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030 by Teagasc demonstrates a range of mitigation options across the agricultural sector and shows that afforestation is a cost efficient land use abatement option.  The cost of forestry measures included in the Climate Action Plan will be fully examined as part of the development of the next National Forestry Programme.</p></reply>

The Foal Levy is currently calculated with reference to SI 735 of 2011, which is the governing legislation.</p>  <p>  HRI's Foal Levy Committee reviews the rates, bands and structures of the levy on an annual basis and has also considered potential alternative methodologies to calculate the levy due. They have concluded that the current banded/tiered approach represents the most equitable and appropriate way of securing the vital funds needed for the breeding sector.  I understand that the majority of foals registered fall into the two lower bands of &euro;35 and &euro;50, and that there is a very high compliance rate of circa 98.3%.</p>  <p>  The levy generates vital funding for the Irish Equine Centre, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association.

The award of organic status is secured by a formal certification process delegated by my Department to various Organic Control Bodies in accordance with the relevant EU regulations. The certification process involves regular inspection of all organic operators, production techniques and sampling of organic produce to ensure compliance with all EU requirements.</p>  <p>  The inspection process for producers of organic salmon is extremely detailed and includes adherence to a range of core organic principles, as well as stocking levels, feeding practice, caging standards, traceability and fish-welfare &amp;amp; husbandry amongst other things. Organic aquaculture sites are also subject to the standard inspection regime applying to conventional producers by the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. In addition, all Organic Control Bodies are independently accredited by an external accreditation body.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the certification system for organic salmon in Ireland was included in a comprehensive audit by the EU of the controls applied by Ireland in the Organic Sector generally. The EU audit team made some recommendations which have been implemented and which further strengthened our control system across the board.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures outlined above are robust enough to provide meaningful assurance to consumers who purchase salmon from organic farms.</p>  <p>  With regard to investigations by my Department, as legal proceedings have been initiated in a certain instance, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p></reply>

We will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangements.</p></reply>

The Government sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.   </p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department had previously carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, to establish the potential volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This exercise has been used to guide relevant planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required.   </p>  <p>  Regarding staffing requirements in the run up to potential Brexit deadlines in March and April, my Department sought to use a combination of recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. My Department worked with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service to engage Veterinary Inspectors, Portal Inspectors, Plant Health Inspectors and Administrative support staff. Mechanisms to temporarily redeploy experienced people within my Department were also initiated and the engagement of contracted temporary service arrangements was also progressed to address contingencies.   </p>  <p>  My Department will have up to 230 staff resources available for deployment across a range of disciplines in both front line control, where the majority of resources will be deployed, as well as back up administrative spheres.   </p>  <p>  Overall, I remain confident that my Department is in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 on animal transport provides that stricter rules may be applied by member states than those set down at EU level.  The Deputy should be aware that my Department has availed of this provision and, therefore, the current Irish legislation, made possible by powers conferred under section 36 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, sets higher standards relating to the approval of ships for livestock transport than those which apply generally in the EU.  Indeed, our legislation is recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent in force as regards transport by sea.</p>  <p>  All animals are inspected and must be certified as regards health status and fitness for travel and cattle on board a livestock ship departing from Ireland.  In addition, due regard must be taken to weather conditions prior to sailings and these measures contribute to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an exporter of livestock of high health status.</p>  <p>  With a view to improving slaughter and transport standards in third countries, my Department, along with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE. The OIE is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health and welfare worldwide.  Ireland has once again proved its ongoing commitment to animal welfare by recently approving additional OIE multi-annual financial assistance to support its activities to enhance animal welfare worldwide. </p>  <p>  The preservation of Ireland&rsquo;s animal health status and the international reputation of veterinary certification services and the existence and application of a regulatory framework ensures that high standards and welfare considerations are taken into account during transport and are components essential to safeguarding the live export trade. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner, with strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being exported.</p></reply>

The plan also creates a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>.</i></p><p>In order to deliver on the ambition set out in the Climate Plan, my Department is developing the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The RESS will be characterised by a series of renewable electricity auctions, aligned with the ambition set out in the Climate Action Plan and the final National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) which is due to be submitted to the European Commission by the end of 2019. The ultimate auction timetable and volumes to be procured in any given year will be determined by a combination of the analysis carried out as part of the NECP, as well as an assessment of the supply pipeline of eligible projects to ensure competitive outcomes for consumers. </p><p>Furthermore, it is my intention that corporate contracting of renewable energy sources (Power Purchase Agreements or PPAs) will provide 15% of the required generation to meet Ireland's 2030 renewable electricity target. Together, the RESS and Corporate PPAs will provide a route to market for the delivery of indicative volumes set out in the Plan of 3.5 GW of offshore renewable generation and up to 1.5 GW of solar and 8.2 GW of onshore wind by 2030.</p><p>In Ireland, the electricity generation market is liberalised and open to both state owned and private enterprises to compete in line with the requirements of the EU internal energy market. Similarly, the awarding of support for renewable generation under the RESS will be through a competitive auction based framework where state owned and private enterprises will compete to deliver projects at the lowest cost to consumers. The RESS is subject to EU State Aid approval, with the qualification process for the first auction expected to begin in Q4 2019. </p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. </p><p>The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole. </p><p>In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.</p><p>Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:</p><p>- public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040</p><p>- measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices</p><p>- new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities)</p><p>- actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions. </p><p>For the first time, a decarbonisation target has been set for each sector. Each Government Department must now determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The exact costs will be determined from the detailed policy design work which will consist of a mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector.</p><p>It should also be noted that there would also be a very significant cost to the Exchequer for not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would also lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run. </p><p>Failure to implement these policies to meet our legally binding EU targets could result in a cost to the Exchequer of up to &euro;1.75 billion over the next decade as well as locking Ireland into a future high carbon trajectory. </p></reply>

It is a matter for each individual local authority in the first instance to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their area and to take the appropriate enforcement action. Local authorities have significant powers available to them under the Waste Management Act, to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity. This includes the power to investigate complaints, prosecute offences, apply to the Courts for the imposition of fines, direct a holder of waste to dispose of it in a certain way within a specific timeframe and monitor and inspect waste holding, recovery and disposal facilities.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency carries out its waste enforcement functions through the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE). The OEE has a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities. It also exercises a supervisory role in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities. In this regard, the OEE acts as a resource to members of the public who have exhausted all other avenues of complaint. </p>  <p>  With respect to this particular site, it is my understanding that the OEE has a Public Authority Enforcement file open in respect of waste deposited on these lands and that this file remains under active consideration.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve and will also enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SEAI to determine whether changes to the scheme are required. It is expected that this review will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

There is also a specific action in the Plan relating to the work of the National Bioeconomy Implementation Group.</p><p>It is also important to recall that the Plan will be monitored quarterly and updated annually, with a Climate Action Plan 2020 to be published in 2020. This will ensure that this Plan is a living document, with new actions being added each year to reflect on-going research and technological developments. </p><p>I am informed that at present the EPA has no specific research work being undertaken on the role of kelp in carbon sequestration. However, a recent 2018 technical research report by the EPA, <i>Valuing Ireland&rsquo;s Coastal, Marine and Estuarine Ecosystem Services</i>,<i></i>presents the data and methods used to estimate the value of a number of marine, coastal and estuarine ecosystem service benefits. </p><p>I understand that similarly, the Marine Institute is not directly involved in research on the role of kelp in carbon sequestration.

The Programme consists of three main schemes: Homes, Warmer Homes; and Communities. These schemes are supplemented by two pilot schemes exploring the multiple benefits of energy efficiency and the challenges of moving to deeper retrofit: the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme; and the Deep Retrofit Pilot.</p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;85 million to these schemes in 2019. </p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan includes ambitious targets of 500,000 retrofits as well as the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes. The Plan commits government to developing a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods. The savings on electricity bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer and produce less emissions. An area based retrofit programme would seek to capitalise on critical mass, leveraging economies of scale that would benefit both householders and the supply chain. This type of programme would focus on designated areas in both rural and urban environments and could be designed and delivered to include local authorities, approved housing bodies or other strategic delivery partners. It would also take account of the priorities to achieve greater depth of retrofit and the targeted replacement of oil boilers with renewable alternatives.</p>  <p>Decisions in relation to funding allocations for residential retrofit in 2020 and future years will be made in the context of the ambitious programme of building energy efficiency upgrades set out in the Climate Action Plan, the annual Estimates processes and the &euro;3.7 billion funding identified in Project Ireland 2040 to support residential energy efficiency upgrades and the installation of heat pumps and solar PV for the period 2018-2027.  </p></reply>

These actions include setting a target level of energy to be supplied by biomethane grid injection in 2030 and holding a public consultation later this year in on the potential to support biomethane use in the transport sector through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.</p><p>Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion has the potential to play an important role in Ireland's transition to a low carbon future. In addition to helping decarbonise the heat, transport and electricity sectors by replacing fossil fuels, the production of biogas can reduce emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors. Diverting wastes, such as slurries, to biogas production avoids the significant levels of greenhouse gases these waste streams would otherwise emit.</p><p>Anaerobic digestion plants can utilise a wide variety of feedstocks, including agricultural waste, in order to produce biogas (a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide). This biogas can be combusted in boilers to produce heat, or in combined heat and power plants to produce both heat and electricity. Alternatively, the biogas can be upgraded by removing the carbon dioxide to produce biomethane which can be injected into the existing gas grid.</p><p>Biomethane can also be utilised in the transport sector. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) can be deployed for all types of road transport vehicles but is particularly suited to larger vehicles such as buses, vans and trucks and therefore represents a viable alternative to diesel for the freight sector. </p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) will support farms and businesses to adopt renewable heating systems, including biogas heating systems. The SSRH has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by agricultural, commercial, industrial, district heating operators and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the rollout of the SSRH for the period of up to 2027.</p><p>Earlier this month, I opened the second phase of the SSRH, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems for applications. Details of this scheme including the tariffs that apply are available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's website at the following link<i></i><i>. </i></p></reply>

In its maintenance of some 2,000 kms of channel each year, OPW is assisted by environmental guidance, developed with IFI. Some of the guidance is conservation driven and some has value added for habitat creation and river enhancement. OPW and IFI have undertaken experimental strategies to change the channel bed using the OPW digging plant. The drainage process tended to make the channel bed very uniform from side to side and in an upstream - downstream direction. The experimental diggings have changed the shape of the channel cross-sections, creating a more diverse habitat, reducing the growth of nuisance vegetation and creating deeper water areas for trout. </p><p>In addition, the over-digging or deepening of the channel bed locally to make deep pools and the spread of the spoil in another area of the channel bed is intended to make shallow areas. This physical diversity can create or help to facilitate biological diversity, including shallow riffle habitat for juvenile salmon, trout, eel and other species and deeper pools for adult fish. These works are completed as part of the OPW drained channel maintenance programme.</p><p>River enhancement within the terms of the Water Framework Directive emphasises restoration of natural river processes. One outcome of the Directive and its impact on EREP is that OPW and IFI have agreed that any proposed 'enhancement' measure should be tested in advance to assess current status of fish and habitat. Four such enhancement proposals are to be so tested in 2019 with surveys of fish and habitat status scheduled. These four sites are set out in the table below; <table><tr><th>Site Location</th><th>NSAD Applicant </th></tr><tr><td>River Deel (downstream of Raharney)</td><td>Boyne Catchment Angling Association</td></tr><tr><td>Trimblestown (downstream of Athboy)</td><td>Trim Athboy Angling Association &ndash; Part 1</td></tr><tr><td>Boycetown at Scurlockstown</td><td>Trim Athboy Anglers Association &ndash; Part 2</td></tr><tr><td>Kells Blackwater Carnaross</td><td>Kells Anglers</td></tr></table></p><p>The IFI Projects Management Office has requested their Research Division to survey these sites as part of the EREP. They relate to projects submitted under the National Strategy for Angling Development by the organisations named above. </p><p>If the Deputy has any specific query in relation to any of these sites I would be happy to ask IFI to contact her. </p></reply>

For example:- Local Authority staff may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples- A Local Authority may bring a prosecution under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations. The maximum fine for breaches of the Regulations is &euro;5,000 on summary conviction. - Fixed payment notices (or &lsquo;on the spot fines&rsquo;) applied by the Local Authority are in operation for alleged offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of prohibited fuels in Low Smoke Zones. </p>  <p>  In addition, coal and low-smoke coal based products being offered for sale within the State must meet environmental specifications. The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for showing compliance these specifications. Bagging operators placing these products on the market must have the SWiFT7 certificate and must also register with the EPA.</p>  <p>  Complaints regarding the sale of prohibited fuels, smoky emissions or other breaches of the regulations should, in the first instance, be reported to the Local Authority concerned.</p></reply>

A Clean Air Dialogue was held between Ireland and the Commission in March 2017, to promote actions to improve air quality and contribute to Ireland's implementation of EU clean air legislation. The productive dialogue included discussion of the proposed national ban, and is summarised in shared conclusions which can be found at the following address: www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/CAD%20conclusions%20%20Final.pdf. </p>  <p>  Under Directive (EU) 2015/1535, the European Commission operates the Technical Regulation Information System, or TRIS. This system is a tool for information, prevention and dialogue in the field of technical regulations on products and information society services. It is intended to help anticipate and prevent the creation of barriers to trade. </p>  <p>  Draft regulations to give effect to the proposed ban were uploaded by my Department to the TRIS system in August 2017, along with a policy analysis statement. No comments or submissions were received from the Commission or from any Member State relating to the draft regulations.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.  I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. </p>  <p>  I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal.   </p></reply>

The aim of this project, which was achieved, was to ensure that all second level students can enhance their learning experience through digital.</p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland has access to high speed broadband. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators have provided no concrete plans to invest. </p><p>My Department published an updated version of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The Map shows is searchable by address/Eircode:</p><p>-  The AMBER area represents the parts of the country where commercial operators have no plans to build high speed broadband networks. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State Intervention. </p><p>-  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>-  The LIGHT BLUE area represents eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017.</p><p>I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. The Government decision on 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>As regards Primary Schools, 674 schools located in the Amber area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State Intervention. 1,965 schools located in the Blue area are already or will be provided with high speed broadband through commercial operators and 503 schools located in the Light Blue area will be provided with high speed broadband through eir&rsquo;s ongoing roll out which is nearing completion.</p><p>The table gives a breakdown by county of Primary schools.<table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>AMBER</th><th>BLUE</th><th>LIGHT BLUE</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>6 </td><td>29 </td><td>6 </td><td>41 </td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>21 </td><td>40 </td><td>14 </td><td>75 </td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>33 </td><td>58 </td><td>21 </td><td>112 </td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>87 </td><td>209 </td><td>52 </td><td>348 </td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>43 </td><td>113 </td><td>19 </td><td>175 </td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>8 </td><td>439 </td><td>2 </td><td>449 </td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>59 </td><td>116 </td><td>54 </td><td>229 </td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>29 </td><td>65 </td><td>38 </td><td>132 </td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>14 </td><td>86 </td><td>3 </td><td>103 </td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>21 </td><td>39 </td><td>14 </td><td>74 </td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>17 </td><td>35 </td><td>13 </td><td>65 </td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>14 </td><td>17 </td><td>8 </td><td>39 </td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>19 </td><td>85 </td><td>31 </td><td>135 </td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>10 </td><td>20 </td><td>7 </td><td>37 </td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>6 </td><td>64 </td><td>1 </td><td>71 </td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>63 </td><td>55 </td><td>48 </td><td>166 </td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>26 </td><td>76 </td><td>13 </td><td>115 </td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>20 </td><td>36 </td><td>5 </td><td>61 </td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>15 </td><td>38 </td><td>13 </td><td>66 </td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>36 </td><td>33 </td><td>22 </td><td>91 </td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>23 </td><td>25 </td><td>19 </td><td>67 </td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>39 </td><td>67 </td><td>49 </td><td>155 </td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>15 </td><td>48 </td><td>12 </td><td>75 </td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>16 </td><td>44 </td><td>14 </td><td>74 </td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>17 </td><td>68 </td><td>19 </td><td>104 </td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>17 </td><td>60 </td><td>6 </td><td>83 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>674 </td><td>1,965 </td><td>503 </td><td>3,142 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Scheme is providing vital, on the ground, evidence of how to overcome the technical and economic challenge of deep retrofit, especially the practical advice and support a householder needs to undertake it. This will help homes achieve an A3 building rating by incorporating works such as insulation, ventilation, window replacement and renewable heating technologies. The results will provide insights into the potential costs of upgrading the building stock, as a greater range of building archetypes are upgraded under the scheme. </p><p>Table 1 below sets out the number of project applications received by the SEAI since 2017. It is important to note that each project application is through a service provider and must include 5 or more houses. This approach is taken in order to incorporate an element of aggregation and maximise the learnings from the pilot.</p><p>Table 1 - Number of Deep Retrofit Projects 2017-2019<table><tr><th>Project Status</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Complete</td><td>11</td><td>25</td><td>0</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>In Progress</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Under Evaluation</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>38</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Withdrawn</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>13</td><td>39</td><td>46</td><td>98</td></tr></table></p><p>The projects &quot;under evaluation&quot; category includes complete applications that are being evaluated as well as applications that are incomplete or not in a position to be proposed for approval. </p><p>Table 2 below outlines the number of individual homes within the project applications.</p><p>Table 2 - Number of Deep Retrofit Homes 2017-2019<table><tr><th>Project Status</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Complete</td><td>120</td><td>139</td><td>0</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>In Progress</td><td>0</td><td>37</td><td>46</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Under Evaluation</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>219</td><td>229</td></tr><tr><td>Withdrawn</td><td>22</td><td>28</td><td>0</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>142</td><td>214</td><td>265</td><td>621</td></tr></table></p><p>As evident from both tables, there has been a sustained increase in demand for the scheme as a direct result of the increased and positive dialogue now being engaged in across Irish society regarding climate change. </p><p>In 2018, the pilot scheme provided grants to homeowners to the value of &euro;4.7m. This year I have allocated &euro;7m to the scheme. At end May 2019, &euro;1m had been paid out in grants. As projects are completed further grants will be drawn down and I expect the full allocation to be spent by year end. </p><p>The recently published Climate Action Plan sets highly ambitious targets of 500,000 retrofits as well as the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes. The lessons learned from the Deep Retrofit Pilot will be of great assistance in designing the policies and approaches required to deliver this target. </p></reply>

The programme will result in the upgrade of 2.4 million meters to modern, smart-ready technology.</p>  <p>  Like all equipment, meters for measuring gas or electricity use require replacement over time and as older brands and models cease to be available, newer technology enables improvements in services and greater efficiencies in meter reading. Smart meters are the next generation electricity meters and will replace older mechanical meters. The question seems to imply a return to mechanical meters that will ultimately be obsolete and no longer available.</p>  <p>  When smart meters are fully operational, consumers will have a choice to be provided with more accurate information about energy usage across the day to allow them to better manage bills with greater accuracy than at present. This information can also help consumers to make more informed choices about their electricity consumption and tariff selection.</p>  <p>  Currently, electricity meters are manually read by ESB Networks up to four times per year. Smart Meters are able to automatically send meter readings so there will be no need for estimated bills.</p>  <p>  New products and services will enable customers to avail of cheaper electricity by managing their energy demand, through the use of night rates or other behavioural signals.</p>  <p>  Smart meters will also support the migration to a carbon free electricity network and will support smart grids, the electrification of heat and transport, local renewable generation and microgeneration.</p>  <p>  ESB Networks will commence the meter replacement programme in autumn 2019. The plan is to replace 250,000 meters between autumn 2019 and the end of 2020 and a further 500,000 meters every year from 2021 to 2024.</p></reply>

It sets out the actions which must be taken in every sector so we can achieve our targets.</p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy, gas will continue to play a role in Ireland&rsquo;s energy mix. Gas contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable electricity generation such as wind and solar. Ireland's gas supplies are sourced from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. </p>  <p>  In relation to LNG projects, commercial developers have proposed a number for development, including the Shannon LNG project and another project in Cork. Final investment decisions for these projects and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoters. </p>  <p>  The production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction, would also be an operational matter for the undertakings involved.

This is a critical matter, as road freight represents the most common means of transporting goods in Ireland, and as such is a vital aspect of the supply chain. Road freight in virtually all instances performs some role in the supply chain, even if it is simply to transport goods the last mile from a port or airport to the customer. </p>  <p>  The research of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit has highlighted how this is a labour rather than a skills shortage, which occurs as a result of employers finding it difficult to attract and retain employees. This is representative of a Europe-wide situation whereby more HGV drivers are exiting the industry than entering it. The logistics sector as a whole has been identified as being unattractive to young people compared to other sectors, due in part to a negative perception based on the idea that work in the sector is generally low-skilled and involves long hours. </p>  <p>  Arising from a recommendation in the latest logistics-related study undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs - Addressing the Skills Needs Arising from the Potential Trade Implications of Brexit - my Department has agreed to chair a Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group, composed of logistics and supply chain stakeholders and education and training representatives, which will work to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in Logistics and Supply Chain activities, including HGV driving.</p>  <p>  This group, which is in the process of being established, will through cross-industry collaboration work to improve the profile of logistics and supply chain roles, making it easier to recruit talent; make progression pathways available to those entering or already working in the roles; ensure development opportunities are available to provide the skills, knowledge and competencies required; enhance employee retention; and provide a forum for ongoing communication and leadership by the logistics and supply chain stakeholders in addressing the skills needs of these activities in Ireland.</p></reply>

In 2010 the Department conducted a review of the Disabled Parking Scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders and one of the issues examined was eligibility for the scheme.  As a result of the review the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness.  This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme to include people with invisible disabilities such as those mentioned by the Deputy has been raised on a number of occasions and the Department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWC), on this matter.  In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  </p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general. </p></reply>

The performance and competitiveness, in quality, service and cost, of all the participants in the transport and logistics chain, including producers, retailers, importers, exporters and transport providers, are relevant. </p>  <p>  The question of what mode is used depends on what is most appropriate, taking account of the technical aspects of each mode, the nature of the goods being moved and requirements of those using them, and Ireland&rsquo;s geographical characteristics.  Rail freight currently accounts for a very low share of freight transported in Ireland, at just over 1% of total domestic freight tonnage.  This reflects the short distances within the island and the generally high-value, low-volume nature of goods being moved. </p>  <p>   A key priority for the Government in relation to investment in the rail network is to safeguard investments already made and to maintain safety standards.  In the framework of national and EU objectives to move to lower-emission modes of transport, my Department will continue to examine with the relevant stakeholders how to support such developments, including where appropriate the development of rail freight.</p></reply>

When my Department provides capital funding to TII for the implementation of the NDP, TII's function is to then deliver on an integrated approach to the future development and operation of the national roads network throughout Ireland. Consequently, TII is best placed to advise on the current status and funding in respect of the above schemes.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your questions to TII for a direct reply.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Each local authority is the contracting authority for the purpose of implementation of regional and local road improvement projects.</p><p>Project Ireland 2040, including the National Development Plan (NDP), is the continuation of the original 2016-2021 &quot;Building on Recovery&quot; capital plan. Under the NDP my Department is committed at present to providing grant funding towards the cost of 12 significant capital road improvement schemes. The table below reflects the current position regarding my Department's funding of the NDP regional and local road schemes mentioned by the Deputy.</p><p>As regards grant expenditure to date on these schemes, the Regional and Local Road payment booklets available in the Oireachtas library provide details of grant payments made by my Department to the end of 2018.  The 2019 Regional and Local Road allocation booklet outlines the allocations for these schemes this year and the table below outlines grants paid out to date in 2019.  I would point out that cost estimates for road improvement schemes are reviewed at project development milestones and allowing for cost inflation and project implementation risks can be subject to change. <table><tr><th>Name of   Project</th><th>Spend to Date in 2019 &euro;</th><th>Total Estimated Cost to DTTaS</th><th>Project Completion Date</th></tr><tr><td>R407 Sallins By Pass </td><td>1,594,133</td><td>57,000,000</td><td>2020</td></tr><tr><td>Athy Southern Distributor Road</td><td>416,333</td><td>34,000,000</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Adamstown and Nangor Road Upgrade</td><td>3,769,578</td><td>18,000,000</td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern Garavogue Bridge and Approach Road</td><td>50,000</td><td>20,000,000</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Southern Distributor Road</td><td>1,091,956</td><td>7,000,000</td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td>Laytown to Bettystown Link Road</td><td>38,606</td><td>5,000,000</td><td>2020</td></tr><tr><td>Dingle Relief Road</td><td>634,119</td><td>4,000,000</td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Crossing/Kilalloe Bypass/R494 Upgrade</td><td>900,956</td><td>62,000,000</td><td>2023</td></tr></table></p><p>The bulk of the funding available under the NDP for regional and local roads is earmarked for maintenance and renewal work.

A Working Group approach was envisaged to review research and best practice in motivating significant modal shift away from cars towards public and active travel.</p><p>Since then, specifically to acknowledge the importance of human and psychological factors in influencing the uptake of sustainable solutions, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have established a dedicated Behavioural Economics Unit which is tasked with researching and communicating methods to encourage people to make better energy use decisions across a range of areas including some aspects of the transport sector.  My Department is working with this Unit on transport projects and in 2018 co-funded a research project with SEAI entitled &lsquo;Examining a range of behavioural nudges that would assist in decarbonising the national car fleet&rsquo;.  The work of this SEAI Unit, securing relevant research and the collaboration with my Department were considered more effective means of advancing this key work than establishing a separate transport specific Behavioural Economics Working Group. </p><p>My Department is very aware that behavioural insight to influence change in the transport sector is  essential.  Supporting a shift away from the use of the passenger car, where feasible, remains central to the transport sector's response, not only to the climate change challenge but also to air quality and congestion challenges. </p><p>The National Development Plan has earmarked &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public and sustainable transport to improve the capacity and attractiveness of the networks.  Since 2013 we have seen an increase of almost 31 million journeys on subsidised public transport and commercial bus services, with an increase of 16 million passengers in 2017 (a 7% rise on 2016 figures) across Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Luas services. </p><p>Furthermore, my Department supports a wide range of active travel behavioural change programmes, including Green Schools, Smarter Workplaces and Campuses, and CycleRight which continue to promote the many and varied benefits of sustainable transport and are instrumental in the decision making of many to reduce car use and switch to more sustainable modes of transport.</p><p>Similarly, the recently published Climate Action Plan contains several actions which seek to increase the level of modal shift.  A copy of the Plan can be found on the website of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, at the following link:<i></i><i><i>www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/climate-action/topics/climate-action-plan/Pages/climate-action.aspx.</i></i></p></reply>

As of the 31st of May 2019 there were 6,573 vehicles registered under the &lsquo;State Owned, Emergency Vehicles and Rescue Vehicles&rsquo; tax classification; the Deputy should note that this definition potentially omits many state/public vehicles that are not registered under this tax exemption category.  Based on this definition, there are 13 electric &ldquo;State Vehicles&rdquo; registered.</p>  <p>  The transition to alternatively-fuelled vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), is a necessary step-change if Ireland is to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions, particularly in the passenger car sector which accounts for over half of all land transport emissions.  In order to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially the uptake of EVs, my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment jointly convened an inter-Departmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce to consider a full suite of potential measures available to Government.  The role of public sector leadership in encouraging EV uptake was examined by the Taskforce; it was recommended that the National Procurement Service introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs which would allow public bodies to purchase EVs with reduced administrative burden.  This recommendation was echoed in the recently published Climate Action Plan (Action 149).  It is expected that this measure will promote greater uptake of EVs within the State Vehicle Fleet. </p>  <p>  While the initial uptake of EVs in Ireland was relatively slow, there are a range of factors accepted internationally as being barriers to transition to EV technology including limited vehicle choice, range anxiety and low consumer awareness.  This slower than anticipated transition to EVs was not Ireland-specific and did not indicate a lack of ambition or support.  Increasing range performances, technology advancements, greater affordability and improved consumer choice are beginning to trigger large-scale change.  This year we saw a marked increase in EV sales; at the end of May 2019 there were 11,418 EVs were registered on Irish roads (6,892 full battery electric and 4,526 plug-in hybrids). </p>  <p>  Beyond the passenger car fleet I am also committed to encouraging greater uptake of low emitting technologies, including electrification, in the public transport fleet.  In the urban bus fleet, I have outlined a clear trajectory to low emission buses, with no more diesel-only buses purchased for the urban public bus fleet from next month and by 2035 to only have low emitting buses in the urban PSO bus fleet.  We also plan to create a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area; this is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year.  It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.  These major projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact on our sectoral emissions profile.</p></reply>

Indications from car manufacturers and energy market analysts suggest that mass market adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is probable.  In order to stimulate this widespread adoption of EVs, as well as other alternative fuels, a Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established in 2016 to recommend to Government a range of measures available to increase the uptake rates of low emitting vehicles.  Consequently, the State has provided and maintained various incentives to mitigate the cost of and encourage the transition away from conventional fossil fuels.  In the recently published Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown an ambitious target of having nearly 1 million over electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030 was set.  </p>  <p>  Over the coming years, further steps will be needed to help move Ireland towards this target and, more broadly, our national emissions targets, and the Climate Action Plan indicates a pathway to achieving this.  Specifically in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion about restricting imports, he will be aware that one of the pillars of EU legislation is to permit the free movement of goods between Member States, and that this allows European citizens greater consumer choice.  Accordingly, there are no plans to introduce a ban on the importation of vehicles from member states; imported vehicles from non-EU jurisdictions, though, could potentially be subject to more stringent restrictions and this will be kept under review.</p></reply>

The Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. </p>  <p>  The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland overall carbon emissions (and about 27% of Ireland's accountable emissions in the non-ETS sector), plays a key role in the national decarbonisation effort.  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions for inclusion in the Climate Action Plan, particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.  </p>  <p>  A critical challenge is reducing the 52% of transport emissions that come from private car use.  Our aim in expanding the carrying capacity and the attractiveness of our public transport and active travel networks is to provide a viable sustainable alternative to private car use for more people for more of their journeys.  Supporting a shift towards more sustainable transport in this way will help reduce congestion, lower climate-harmful emissions, and improve air quality. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, an indicative allocation of &euro;8.6 billion is assigned to support sustainable mobility.  This will make public transport and active travel a viable alternative for more people for more of their journeys.  The substantial investment will be used to support MetroLink, BusConnects, the DART Expansion Programme and vastly improved active travel infrastructure in all our major cities.  In fact, the National Development Plan budget for new public transport/active travel projects is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment between these two areas in the past.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that prioritising investment in our public transport network is working; during the reporting period of 2017 alone, an additional 16 million public transport passenger journeys were made in Ireland while the number of walking and cycling trips also increased, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the carbon footprint of this significant modal shift is minimised we are committed to improving the energy and emissions efficiencies of the public transport fleet.  Of course, because less than 5% of Ireland's transport-derived CO2 emissions arise from public transport, we need to realise that efforts to "green" the fleet will have only a limited impact in reducing emissions, but these measures are nonetheless important in leadership terms.  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low emission buses has been outlined in the Climate Action Plan.  We are committed to no longer purchasing diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from next month and by 2035 to only have low emitting buses in the urban PSO bus fleet. </p>  <p>  For rail we&rsquo;ve significantly increased the amounts of money made available each year to support the maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network, which is now funded at the so-called &lsquo;steady state&rsquo; level as measured on an annual basis.  That means more investment in important works such as track relaying, ballast-cleaning and signal improvements all resulting in an improved passenger experience across the country.  This year, I expect construction to start on a new National Train Control Centre which will be a state-of-the-art network management centre and it will lay the groundwork for the expansion of services planned in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  It is equally important to consider the potential contribution of electrified rail to decarbonisation objectives.  We plan to create a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area; this is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year.  It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.  In this regard, the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recently commenced a procurement process for the establishment of a 10 year framework agreement for the purchase of additional lower emitting rail fleet required for the expansion of the DART network.  These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact on our sectoral emissions profile.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as set out in the Climate Action Plan we have also committed to next year commencing an evaluation of the potential economic benefits associated with development of a high-speed network along the major inter-urban rail network against improvements to the existing network to deliver high speeds.</p></reply>

A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve approach (MACC) was used to compare &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; economic activity to &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; options. In the Plan an estimated marginal cost per tonne of carbon abated was attributed to certain technologies. This technique allows for comparative analysis of &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; alternatives across key sectors. An overview of costs and emission reduction potential of sector-specific mitigation approaches can be found in Table 4.2 of the Climate Action Plan (page 28) ). </p><p>According to this analysis some of the most cost-effective abatement opportunities - from a societal perspective - include the electrification of transport. This is expected due to fast-falling battery prices, which are likely to put the lifetime total cost of ownership of electric vehicles on par with those of fossil fuel vehicles over the next decade or so. The Climate Action Plan shows the expected average abatement cost over the period 2021 to 2030 for switching from fossil-fuelled passenger cars to electric vehicles on a total cost of ownership basis at around -&euro;116 cost per tonne.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the estimated cost per tonne of emissions abated through measures that encourage modal shift to either public transport or active travel is less readily available. Nevertheless, indicative calculations by my Department estimate that by replacing 10,000 daily car journeys with cycling (assuming the replaced car journey length was equivalent to the average bike journey length in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA)) approximately 37.25 ktCO<sub>2 </sub>could be abated between 2020 and 2030. The National Transport Authority has also estimated that replacing 10% of car trips in the GDA (travelling the average GDA morning peak distance) with public transport could potentially result in an annual emission abatement of 22ktCO<sub>2.</sub>.  For context, the transport sector in Ireland emitted a little over 12,000 ktCO<sub>2</sub>in 2017.</p><p>To further reduce the carbon footprint of modal shift towards public transport I have committed to continuing to improve the energy and emissions efficiencies of the public transport fleets. In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low emission buses has been outlined with no more diesel-only buses being purchased for the urban public bus fleet from next month and by 2035 to only have low-emitting buses in the urban PSO bus fleet. My Department has estimated that when the entire bus fleet is converted to low-emitting that up to 15 ktCO<sub>2 </sub>will be saved annually compared to the business-as-usual diesel fleet.</p><p>It is also important to consider the potential contribution of electrified rail to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.  We plan to create a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area; this is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks, resulting in approximately 130 ktCO<sub>2 </sub>­annual abatement when complete. The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recently commenced a procurement process for the establishment of a 10 year framework agreement for the purchase of additional lower-emitting rail fleet required for the expansion of the DART network. In addition, the delivery of eight additional high capacity Luas trams could also reduce emissions by 12 ktCO<sub>2</sub>per annum, assuming the Luas trips replace 63.3 million kms driven by private car. These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact on our sectoral emissions profile.</p><p>It is clear that prioritising investment in our public and active transport network and encouraging modal shift is working &ndash; during the reporting period of 2017 alone, an additional 16 million public transport passenger journeys were made in Ireland while the number of walking and cycling trips also increased, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area. Collectively, these efforts have resulted in activities that yield fewer CO<sub>2</sub>emissions in addition to reducing vehicle volume and improving air quality. In fact, 2017 saw a welcome return to a drop in transport sector emissions, the first time in four years.  </p><p>Finally, in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding diverting freight to rail, it is important to note that Irish rail freight quantities are comparatively small and have declined over recent decades. Long run data from the CSO shows that the total tonnage of goods carried by rail decreased from 3.4 million tonnes in 1985 to 581,000 tonnes in 2016.  Internationally, where viable, rail freight can be a lower emitting alternative to road freight, particularly over long distances with bulky loads.  However, in Ireland, the limited number of high-volume bulk movements combined with the country's small size and low density of activity means that rail freight is not generally as economically viable as road freight, although in certain, specific circumstances it does provide a viable alternative.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council. </p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific or Strategic Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 20240 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take time. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  I understand that Cork County Council, which had responsibility for Lehenaghmore, had prepared a draft road improvement scheme for the area with a view to improving public transport and pedestrian access. Responsibility for Lehenaghmore has now been transferred to Cork City Council. I understand that there has been interaction between both Councils and the National Transport Authority regarding the scheme which fed into a review of aspects of the design. Once the design of the proposed scheme is finalised it will be for the Council to decide how best to proceed.</p>  <p>  If funding is sought under the Regional and Local Road Programme, a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to the proposed upgrade will have to be submitted as required under the capital project appraisal process. Once an appraisal is received it has to be assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget.  Such an appraisal has not been submitted to date by Cork County Council or Cork City Council in relation to the upgrade of the L2455 Lehenaghbeg/Lehenaghmore road.  It is also open to the Council to consider other sources of funding, including own resources. </p></reply>

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to make work pay for parents.  </p>  <p>I have also worked to poverty-proof the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme. Indeed, international reports have stated that the Scheme will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11th position. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Childcare Scheme includes specific arrangements for vulnerable children and families to be sponsored by certain statutory bodies to enable such children to avail of free or additional childcare under the Scheme.  The five statutory bodies specified as sponsors in the Childcare Support Act 2018, and the specific groups of children who will benefit, are:</p>  <p>  - Minister for Education and Skills - for teen parents who are still in education or training;</p>  <p>  - Minister for Justice and Equality - for refugees and asylum seekers, to enable parents' participation in education, integration and other relevant supports;</p>  <p>  - Child and Family Agency - to promote the welfare of children, either where there is a child protection concern, or as a form of early intervention or family support;</p>  <p>  - HSE - to support child development for children who are below the age for participation in ECCE and where there is an identified need for childcare as a developmental support for the child; and</p>  <p>  - Local Authorities &ndash; to support homeless persons with children that are homeless or moving out of homelessness to access childcare services.</p>  <p>  Arrangements are also in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. All families in receipt of current targeted supports will have the choice to switch over to the new scheme when it launches or to remain on their current support (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until at least the end of August 2020.</p>  <p>  Department officials have also been directed to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.  In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p></reply>

The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  The NCS will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) cost. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports.  It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.  Many working families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.  Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy. </p>  <p>  I am committed to transforming the Irish childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the best.  This requires sustained investment over several years.  Over the last four budgets, investment in childcare has increased by 117%, while over past four years, childcare places in Ireland have doubled and the overall number of children supported by State subsidies has doubled.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to support providers with regard to increased provision of early learning and care and school age childcare places. In 2019, I have secured a capital budget of &euro;6.25m for the sector which will enable a focus on further increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  In terms of specific capital funding made available for School Age Childcare services, &euro;1m was allocated, with individual grants of up to &euro;20,000 in value available for providers for the creation of new school age places. It is anticipated that this funding will assist in the creation of more than 2,300 additional school age places.</p>  <p>  I am also very pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan ( 2018-2027) and to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for early learning and care and school age childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large-scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.</p>  <p>  This capital investment will, I believe, be essential to respond to the increased demand in the years ahead. Research is on-going in my Department to determine areas of specific need that the National Development Plan funding will address when it comes on-stream. </p></reply>

An increase of 4.5% in the budget for the youth sector would result in an overall allocation of &euro;63.113m; this would be a &euro;2.7m difference from the current allocation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department is currently managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention. </p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State as well as an Area Profiling, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement tool which was designed in collaboration with the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector and was officially launched in January 2019. This mapping and tool will assist the Department and the relevant ETBs in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify requirements in their area and facilitate decisions on service requirement by reference to evidenced need.</p></reply>

At that time it set a target date of 2020 for the implementation of TCA.  More recently, the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 targeted implementation of the TCA from Q3 of 2020.  This is subject to the necessary legislation being enacted and supporting structures being in place.  </p>  <p>  Consultation is a very important part of the development and design of the new pension.  With this in mind, I launched a public consultation on the design of the TCA on the 28th of May 2018 to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback. </p>  <p>  Shortly afterwards, Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing by my officials in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them including how self-employed people and Class S PRSI contributions since 1988 could be treated.</p>  <p>  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is now designing the scheme and I intend to shortly bring a proposal to Government setting out that design.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of a report in one particular publication which was inaccurate in this respect, and I understand that the publication in question has subsequently published a correction. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.<b></b></p><p>In February 2017, the CIB Board made  the decision to restructure the governance arrangements of the network of 93 local Citizens Information Services and MABS companies to 16 regional companies (8 Regional CIS and 8 Regional MABS). </p><p>The aim of the restructuring was to enhance the service for users by improving the governance arrangements for CIB&rsquo;s funded services and optimising the benefits from operating a more modern and streamlined citizen-focused service delivery model. </p><p>This restructuring process was completed in October 2018. New service-level agreements are in place for all the new companies, in line with best governance practice.</p><p>All staff, assets and liabilities of the local MABS companies have transferred to the new companies.  There have been no job losses, no closure of service delivery points and no diminution in services provided to MABS clients.  To support the new regional structure eight additional posts were created across the network with the appointment of a Regional Manager in each of the new MABS companies.</p><p>The benefits in service delivery to MABS clients are evident.  The regional companies have more flexibility in allocating staff resources to areas of need and specialist skills are more easily shared. Administrative resources freed up from previous work associated with supporting 51 local companies can now be focused directly on client's requirements.  Standardisation of practices is being achieved.  More regular case reviews are being undertaken and there is increased focus on quality assurance and on achieving improved outcomes to clients debt problems.</p><p>The total cost of the restructuring of the MABS companies amounted to &euro;668,240, based on an apportionment of the costs between the CIS (45%)  and MABS (55%) networks.  This figure also includes the 2018 costs of employing the 8 new Regional Managers in the MABS companies.</p><p>CIB continues to work closely with the new boards and regional managers to support the new companies and ensure that delivery of high quality services to citizens remain the priority.</p></reply>

As the highest achievable rate is already in payment, the person is better off to remain on their existing rate of payment. </p>  <p>  An advisory letter to this effect has issued to the person concerned.  This letter encourages them to contact the dedicated helpline if they want this outcome explained to them in more detail. </p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the maximum rate State pension (contributory), there are other state pension payments available. Notably, they may qualify for the State pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of State pension (contributory).  If their spouse has a contributory pension they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, (based on the qualified adult's means), amounting to up to 90% of a full rate pension. Only those with significant means would not be eligible for these payments.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

At that time it set a target date of 2020 for the implementation of TCA.  More recently, the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 targeted implementation of the TCA from Q3 of 2020.  This is subject to the necessary legislation being enacted and supporting structures being in place.   </p>  <p>  Consultation is a very important part of the development and design of the new pension.  With this in mind, I launched a public consultation on the design of the TCA on the 28th of May 2018 to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback. </p>  <p>  Shortly afterwards, Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing by my officials in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them including how self-employed people and Class S PRSI contributions since 1988 could be treated.</p>  <p>  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is now designing the scheme and I intend to shortly bring a proposal to Government setting out that design.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  As I have stated before, the position of Class S contributors will be considered carefully in the finalisation of the scheme, particularly in the context of the introduction of Class S in 1988, and any implications that might have in relation to the final scheme decided upon.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which, arising from these demographic changes alone, are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 4 to 5 years.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person loses their employment before reaching State pension age, they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age.  In this regard, the duration of jobseeker's payments will naturally adjust in line with increases in state pension age.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Further extension of that scheme is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.

Additional supports can be provided through a supplement under the SWA scheme which can be paid in addition to the weekly social welfare payment.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These measures aim to recognise the needs of carers through the provision of appropriate income supports, to enable carers to remain in touch with the labour market to the greatest extent possible and to empower carers to participate fully in economic and social life.  These income supports include the following:</p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s  Allowance</p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance </p><p>Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the Household Benefits Package and a Free Travel Pass.  </p><p>Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  </p><p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments. </p><p>The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  </p><p>Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the pension entitlement calculation, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently implementing reviews in respect of pensioners who reached pension age on or after 1 September 2012, many of whom were affected by the rateband changes and some of whom were not, but who may benefit from the new scheme, notably the provisions regarding Homecaring.  To date, over 26,000 such pensioners have benefitted, and others are expected to benefit as reviews progress.  It is important to note that nobody is worse off as a result of these reviews, with pensioners receiving the same amount as they previously did if the reviews do not warrant an increase.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing the level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA on the 28th of May 2018 to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is now finalising the scheme and I intend to shortly bring a proposal to Government setting out that design.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I believe the deliberate mis-classification of a worker as a self-employed contractor, in a situation where they are actually working as an employee, is wrong for a number of reasons. </p>  <p>  Firstly, it denies the worker full protection under the Social Welfare Acts, which means he or she is deprived of entitlements such as short-term illness and disability benefits.  Secondly, it deprives the worker of protection under labour law which means the a worker is left without any redress if they are unfairly dismissed, made redundant, or are not paid minimum wage rates, for example.  Thirdly, this form of non-compliance by employers deprives all taxpayers in the form of reduced returns to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I believe that enforcement of PRSI compliance is paramount and I have instructed my Department's inspectors to increase the level of employer inspections nationwide.  This work is ongoing.  Additionally, I have established a new Unit of inspectors, specifically trained and dedicated to the detection and tackling of false self-employment in particular.</p>  <p>  I have also assigned my officials the task of modernising the Code of Practice on employment status.  This is a vital tool for employers and employees so they can be clear when a worker is genuinely self-employed or alternatively when they should be recorded as an employee under full PRSI.  A new manual &ndash; the Guidance on Employment Status &ndash; is currently being finalised.  The new Guidance will be put on a statutory footing, to ensure it becomes central to the decision-making process in employment status cases.</p>  <p>  A good deal of progress has been made by my officials in developing a number of legislative proposals that strengthen the protections for workers in situations of false self-employment.  These include providing anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status.  I also wish to increase penalties for employers who deliberately mis-classify employees as being self-employed. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to finalise the Guidance document and the legislative proposals and I hope to progress these this year.</p>  <p>  The Trade Union movement has a key part to play in any work to tackle these issues and I value its input, as I value the input of employer representative bodies. </p>  <p>  I have consulted with both sides regarding this matter of false self-employment as part of my own and my officials' engagement in the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF).  I chaired the inaugural meeting of the LEEF subgroup on Employment Legislation and Regulation and I and my Department bring these issues to the LEEF plenary meetings.  There have been four Employment Subgroup meetings since it was established in July 2018, and four LEEF Plenaries at which this topic was discussed with ICTU. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Accordingly, such plans, and the information sought in relation to the Castlelands Masterplan in particular, are a matter for the local planning authority and, as Minister, I have no direct function in the adjudication of the masterplan preparation process.  </p>  <p>  The preparation of the Castlelands Masterplan within Balbriggan is a requirement of the Fingal County Development Plan 2017-2023, for lands that are primarily subject to a zoning objective to &ldquo;Provide for new residential communities, subject to the provision of the necessary social and physical infrastructure.&rdquo;  This requirement is for one of a total of eight such Masterplan areas within Balbriggan under the Fingal County Development Plan.  </p>  <p>  While Masterplans are not formal statutory development plans under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), they may be prepared in order to set out further technical detail in respect of zoned amenity and/or development lands, to inform future planning applications and/or &lsquo;Part 8&rsquo; Local authority consent processes.</p>  <p>  Proposals for development set out in Masterplans further to a County Development Plan are required to be consistent with national and regional development objectives and any relevant specific planning policy requirements set out in ministerial guidance.  As part of a masterplan consultation process, a planning authority may invite the submissions and observations of interested parties, and this may inform the outcome of the masterplan process.  </p>  <p>  In cases where a masterplan informs the preparation of a planning application in full or in part, the assessment of any subsequent planning applications pursuant to that masterplan, is the stage of the development process at which the intended outcome of the masterplan, in full or in part, is subject to formal determination by the local planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  The non-statutory nature of masterplans means that the local planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la are not required to be bound by all of the objectives of a masterplan in the determination of a planning application.  This is particularly relevant where a masterplan is deemed to be not consistent with national and regional development objectives or any relevant specific planning policy requirements set out in Ministerial guidance.</p>  <p>  It remains the right of interested parties to make a submission in respect of any planning application on lands subject to a masterplan and to also make a subsequent appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (if submissions have been made to the local authority in respect of the relevant planning application).  In the case of strategic housing development (also known as &lsquo;SHD&rsquo;), for proposals with more than 100 dwellings, there is also provision for submissions to be made by any interested party to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as part of the application process. </p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), as Minister, I am specifically precluded from exercising power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

The Implementation Group has met formally on a number of occasions (18 October 2016, 25 November 2016, 26 January 2017, 22 September 2017 and 22 May 2019) and informally on 18 August 2017, to consider the recommendations across a number of common themes relating to legislative provisions, communications and stakeholder engagement, the Board's role and governance, along with organisational and operational matters. A table detailing dates and attendees is included below. The schedule of meetings also reflects the Board's need to deliver on other reform initiatives outside of the review, particularly the introduction and early operation of the new Strategic Housing Development process in the second half of 2017 and into 2018.</p><p>Both my Department and the Board have continued to progress their relevant recommendations between meetings of the group and also through routine engagements which take place on a regular basis to progress a variety of matters including workforce planning, governance and oversight, the Board's Information and Communications Technology project and legislative matters, some of which are relevant to the work which is being undertaken in addressing the organisational review. The impact of the progress made is demonstrated in significant improvements being achieved by the Board in its rate of compliance with the target periods for determination of cases.</p><p>A further formal meeting of the Implementation Group will be held in Q3 2019. The membership of the Implementation Group is published in its Terms of Reference which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>Due to a number of recent staff changes in both organisations, the membership of the review group will be refreshed in advance of the next formal meeting. The Implementation Group will continue its work over the coming months with a view to publishing its final report on implementation by the end of Q3 2019.</p><p><table><tr><th>Date of meeting</th><th>Attendees - DHPLG</th><th>Attendees - ABP</th></tr><tr><td>18 October 2016</td><td>Terry Sheridan (Co-Chair), Niall Cussen, Niamh Drew, Brendan Buggy </td><td>Loretta Lambkin   (Co-Chair), Rachel Kenny, Gerry Egan</td></tr><tr><td>25 November 2016</td><td>Terry Sheridan (Co-Chair), Niall Cussen, Niamh Drew, Brendan Buggy</td><td>Loretta Lambkin (Co-Chair), Gerry Egan</td></tr><tr><td>26 January 2017</td><td>Terry Sheridan (Co-Chair), Niall Cussen, Niamh Drew, Brendan Buggy </td><td>Loretta Lambkin   (Co-Chair), Rachel Kenny, Gerry Egan</td></tr><tr><td>22 September 2017</td><td>Terry Sheridan (Co-Chair), Niamh Drew</td><td>Loretta Lambkin (Co-Chair), Gerry Egan</td></tr><tr><td>22 May 2019</td><td>Terry Sheridan (Co-Chair), Ciara Gallagher</td><td>David Walsh, Loretta Lambkin (Co-Chair),</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.

When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin region is removed, 28.9% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 16.3% above rent limits provided. This increases to 22.2% when the Dublin region homeless area data is included.</p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland. </p></reply>

The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversees the implementation of this initiative and, working in partnership with the National Transport Authority, has put arrangements in place for the provision of Leap cards to the families concerned.

The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that &ndash;</p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;</p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship, and</p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own  separate differential rent scheme or schemes in operation. All these schemes, including those referenced by the Deputy, ensure that the rent payable is related to household income albeit at different headline percentage rates. As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other. This is particularly the case when it comes to what may or may not be considered as reckonable/assessable income for rent purposes. Typically all local authorities make available their up to date rent scheme online.  </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for the Minister to introduce a national rents framework for social housing tenants. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, to ensure that rent schemes are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market. The general over-arching principle that rents should be related to incomes will be maintained.  </p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future, at which point I will consider what proposals might be brought to Government as part of a wider social housing reform package of measures, that would continue to ensure that housing support goes to those who need it most within a system that is responsive to people&rsquo;s changing needs and circumstances. I hope to finalise this matter by the end of Q3 2019.</p></reply>

Ireland has been a Party to the Convention since 8<sup>th</sup>January 2002.</p><p>Ireland does not have significant trade in ivory specimens and the domestic market allows only for trade in pre-Convention ivory. This trade consists primarily of carved artifacts, antique items and some musical instrument components and is governed by CITES. </p><p>Applications for CITES certificates or permits are examined carefully by the Irish CITES Management Authority in my Department to determine that the ivory has an attested legal origin. If the Management Authority is satisfied that the ivory has been legally acquired, it will then issue a certificate or permit to verify that fact in line with current CITES regulations.</p><p>The EU and its Member States have been at the forefront in the regulation of ivory trade and stringent rules are already in place. While these have functioned effectively to date, the current EU ivory guidance document is in the process of revision and will incorporate stricter rules on trade in raw and worked ivory. </p><p>As a Member State, Ireland participates in regular EU CITES Management Committee and Scientific Group meetings and supports a common EU approach to CITES matters, including the ivory trade.
