In the 2021/2022school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost of the scheme in 2021 was &euro;289m. </p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. Already over 125,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to mainstream applicants for the new school year.</p>  <p>  Already for the new school year 2022/2023, over 17,400 children are availing of transport under the Special Educational Needs Scheme.  This is an increase of 22% on the 2021/2022 school year.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the NCSE&rsquo;s Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the pupils referred to by the Deputy are eligible under the terms of the scheme and a sanction has been sent by the School Transport Section of my Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the establishment of a new service for pupils to the school referred to by the Deputy.? </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have tendered this service in line with procurement guidelines and are in the process of allocating a contractor to operate this service. Once a contractor has been sourced, the service will commence.? Bus &Eacute;ireann will liaise with the families directly with regard to this matter at that stage. </p>  <p>  Both the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the challenges faced by parents awaiting transport for students with special educational needs. Families of children who are eligible for these services, but who experience a delay with accessing them, may therefore apply for the Special Transport Grant. This is a once off payment, paid retrospectively to families to assist with the cost of private transport arrangements the family had put in place until services are finalised. Families should contact the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Section at: school_transport@education.gov.ie for more information on this grant. </p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>  It was a very significant achievement to have secured &euro;9.6 billion for Education in Budget &rsquo;23. This will enable many ground-breaking investments in our education system, furthering the work of this Government in recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting achievement of all our students.</p>  <p>  A rise in the cost of living should never be a barrier to education. I am very pleased therefore to have the support of my colleagues in Government to ensure this remains the case and as part of the cost of living measures I have secured &euro;90m for additional capitation funding.</p>  <p>  All recognised Primary and Post-Primary schools in the Free Education scheme will benefit from this additional capitation funding in 2022 which represents an increase of circa 40% of current standard and enhanced capitation rates.</p>  <p>  The additional grant will be paid at the rate of &euro;75 per pupil at Primary level and &euro;113 at Post-Primary level. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with Special Educational needs. Arrangements are being made to issue this this payment as soon as possible and schools can use this to cover additional energy costs and other increased day to day operating costs. </p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured in recent years that centrally negotiated rates were made available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels through frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). A significant number of schools signed up to these and are availing of highly competitive energy prices. The Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p>  <p>  I also want to draw attention to the Budget 2023 announcement of funding from the Climate Action Fund in relation to the provision of Photovoltaic (PV) Panels in schools up to 6KW output.</p>  <p>  This is really positive news and will assist with their energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our schools.</p>  <p>  My Department officials are working closely with Department of Environment, Climate and Communications colleagues in relation to the arrangements for this scheme and details will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The review of the School Transport Scheme is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  Following commencement of the review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021, with regard to eligibility and with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, for the 2021/2022 school year, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  These measures will be continued for the current school year, pending completion of the review and means transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review which involves a detailed analysis of the objectives of the Scheme, after this work, the final phase of the review will examine issues around scheme performance, scheme expenditure and will include a full examination of the current eligibility criteria including the issue of ethos in determining eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  While work on the review is being impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p></reply>

The service provided by NEPS is broad, and encompasses a model that seeks to strengthen the overall capacity of the system to support the wellbeing, participation and inclusion of all children and young people in our schools, but particularly for those with special educational needs.  Our psychologists work with teachers, parents and children/young people in schools to provide a range of services as follows:</p>  <p>  -  Psychologists support schools to identify and respond to need, through regular planning and review meetings.  </p>  <p>  -  They provide support to schools in the event of a Critical Incident.  </p>  <p>  -  They provide a school staff Support and Development Service, which supports school staff in their work.  This might include, for example, training staff in the provision of trauma informed school approaches, or in the provision of evidence-based programmes to strengthen resilience and reduce anxiety.  This broad service is provided to an estimated 25,000 school staff annually. </p>  <p>  -  Psychologists also provide an individual casework service for children and young people, and this is a much valued element of their work in schools.  This is where the focus of the work is on individual students, and the psychologist meets school staff, parents and the student themselves, in order to identify and assess student strengths and needs and agree on an appropriate plan of intervention and review.  In these cases, NEPS psychologists always provide a written report for parents and the school principal.  In 2021, the NEPS casework service extended to over 8500 students. Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students.</p>  <p>  My Department has established a high-level working group, chaired by the Secretary General, to examine how the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) can nest continue to recruit adequate numbers of suitably qualified staff and continue to respond to the educational psychological needs of children in primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p>  <p>  The group has agreed on a number of actions that must be taken to address supply issues in the medium to long term. These include the development of a workforce plan for educational psychologists within the Department of Education and work has begun with other Government Departments to advance this.</p>  <p>  A number of options were considered to address some immediate supply issues.  Following analysis of these, it was decided that the Department would use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third year students of the Educational Psychology Doctoral programme in University College Dublin (UCD) and Mary Immaculate College (MIC) University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022/23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.  The workforce planning group referred to above will be asked to make some interim recommendations in Q2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of their final report. It is envisaged that funding supports for students on the educational psychological doctorate programme will be considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  In the interim, given the particular time pressures for students in third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students of Educational Psychology, currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023.  Details will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.   The findings of the review will underpin future planning for the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. The review of the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of this, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments. </p>  <p>  While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p>  <p>  School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department. In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost of the scheme in 2021 was &euro;289m.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees to families that avail of the scheme, and for a contribution towards the cost of fuel for contractors operating the scheme for the coming 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29th   July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. Already over 125,791 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to applicants for the new school year.</p>  <p>  At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, a 20% overall increase.

As you are likely aware, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a school-based psychological service to all recognised primary and post-primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, and the academic, social and emotional development of all learners.  </p><p>The NEPS service provides access for all schools to:</p><p>-  Psychological support in the event of a Critical Incident</p><p>-  A Casework Service for individual children where there is a need for intensive consultation and assessment </p><p>-  A school staff Support and Development Service, to build school capability to provide a comprehensive continuum of support in schools<i>and</i></p><p>-  Ongoing access to advice and support for schools.</p><p>This overall approach allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent individual cases and, through supporting school staff, to benefit many more children than could be seen individually.</p><p>In 2021 the NEPS casework service extended to over 8,500 students. Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students. Furthermore, the NEPS Support and Development service reaches an estimated 25,000 teachers annually. </p><p>NEPS was allocated a budget of approximately &euro;24 million in 2022 to deliver its essential service. </p><p>A working group in the Department has been examining the matter of how the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) can continue to recruit adequate numbers of suitably qualified staff and continue to respond to the educational psychological needs of children in primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p><p>The group has agreed on a number of actions that must be taken to address supply issues in the medium to long term. These include the development of a workforce plan for educational psychologists within the Department of Education and work has begun with other Government Departments to advance this. </p><p>A number of options were considered to address some immediate supply issues.  Following analysis of these, it was decided that the Department would use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third year students of the Educational Psychology Doctoral programme in University College Dublin (UCD) and Mary Immaculate College (MIC) University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022/23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.  The workforce planning group referred to above will be asked to make some interim recommendations in Q2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of their final report. It is envisaged that funding supports for students on the educational psychological doctorate programme will be considered as part of this process.  <i></i></p><p>In the interim, given the particular time pressures for students in third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students of Educational Psychology, currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023.  Details will be made available in the coming weeks.  <i></i></p></reply>

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie </p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

Along with these preventative actions, ventilation further reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools. </p><p>The Expert Group guidance also identifies that in areas with poor ventilation, structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed and if not possible in the short term, that consideration should be given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions. </p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  As noted in my Department&rsquo;s Guidance, where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps have been considered and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available.</p><p>To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19, the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021.</p><p>The Expert Group guidance also outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. My Department have funded and delivered in excess of 42,000 monitors to schools nationwide at a cost of over &euro;4 million. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s guidance is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on 20th January 2022 and general advice on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre 10 May 2022.</p><p>As part of the Cost of Living, measures to be enacted this year &euro;90m is being provided in one-off additional funding to support increased running costs for primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme in dealing with challenges they face in light of rising energy costs. This will be paid at a rate of approximately 40% of schools&rsquo; basic and enhanced rates of capitation.  </p><p>In conclusion, my Department is fully aware of the importance of good ventilation in schools. Our approach, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already 125,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have been issued to applicants for the for the 2022/2023 school year. At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600  children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created. There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties, including the areas referred to by the Deputies. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the upcoming school year, has led to some delays in issuing tickets. </p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible. Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July. </p>  <p>  I hope that the Deputy will be happy to note that, following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process, some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p>  <p>   The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally.</p>  <p>  Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 24 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools and supporting small schools and I am delighted that significant progress has been made.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, I ensured major investment in our schools and I have succeeded in bringing the teacher allocation ratio to an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 23 pupils in all primary schools for the 2023/24 school year which is the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This was my third successive Budget which saw an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools. Budget 2021 reduced the staffing schedule to an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils, while Budget 2022 reduced it further to 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils. </p>  <p>  This significantly increased investment reflects my commitment and that of Government to support the educational success of learners and to provide a quality inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for all.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I also introduced a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. The recent announcement in Budget 2023 will further reduce this retention schedule, by virtue of the one point improvement to the staffing schedule which helps to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools as well as primary schools on our islands.  </p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board, including a specific measure aimed at small schools.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board will meet later this month to consider staffing appeals in respect of the current school year.</p></reply>

There are two Assemblies currently in progress: the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Biodiversity Loss which commenced in April 2022 and the Dublin Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin, which also commenced in April 2022. </p>  <p>  Two further Citizens&rsquo; Assemblies are committed to under the current Programme for Government: one on the use of drugs and the other on the future of education.

The establishment of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the future of Education will be the subject of a Government decision and resolutions of the D&aacute;il and Seanad at the appropriate time. The question of when the Assembly might commence depends in large part on how soon the current Assemblies conclude their work and submit their reports.</p>  <p>  My published Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 sets out the framework for the Department&rsquo;s work for the period 2021-2023, including advancing education commitments in the Programme for Government.

This work includes liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach and ongoing discussion with key stakeholders across school communities. </p>  <p>  The commitment in the Programme for Government also states that the voices of young people and those being educated are central to this Assembly. The impact that children and young people have on shaping their own learning experience is a focus of the work of my Department, and through this process we will work with children and young people to include their voices both through the consultation process and the Assembly itself.

The programme will see up to ten schools benefitting from a selection of energy efficiency works.</p>  <p>  This programme continues to assist the Department to explore options and test various solutions for decarbonised energy efficiency solutions in our broad range of school building types. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits my Department to develop and resource a scalable model of energy efficiency retrofits in the school sector. The pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger schools national programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan and will play a key part of meeting delivery of the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Design teams are being appointed to each of the schools in the Pathfinder Programme in the feasibility stage, to investigate retrofit and decarbonisation options, and works will roll out from summer 2023, subject to the outcome of the feasibility stage. The feasibility stage includes looking at various options for potential retrofit levels with renewable heat, up to what would be required to be a Zero Emission Building. </p>  <p>  The schools for 2023 present a variety of challenges, including building age, archetype and retrofit requirements. The works typically involve upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades, as well as renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 42 schools across Ireland to date, with work on an additional 15 schools currently at various stages of progress. </p>  <p>  The general principles and approach to school selection include schools meeting Energy Monitoring and Reporting requirements and demonstrating a strong and holistic commitment to energy management practices through participation in the Energy in Education Programme. The programme selection also seeks to enable various cross sections of school types and sizes, energy consumption profiles and different elements of construction type and heritage/ conservation requirements where specific learnings are being targeted. The pathfinder programme is thus delivered on broad assessment in line with the above considerations and not on an application basis. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published earlier this year commits the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  I will also be announcing in due course a Climate Action Summer Works Programme to progress climate action specific initiatives which will assist with rollout of smaller scale energy retrofit works in schools.</p></reply>

The 2022 summer programme built on the expanded programmes of 2020 and 2021. From 2021, all schools were given the opportunity to run at least one summer programme.</p>  <p>  In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes in 2022 was up to &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the programme continues to focus on supporting pupils with complex special educational needs and my Department has provided support to schools to run the summer programme to cater for these students. </p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allowed principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff. Capitation funding and preparation hours were provided to schools who participated in the programme, with additional funding and hours provided to schools that run the Special Class and Special School Programme.  Further funding was also made available to Special Schools, in recognition of the extra complexities in running programmes in their schools.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased to be able to say that an additional &euro;20 million funding has been approved under Budget &lsquo;23to continue the expanded summer programme for 2023, bringing the total to &euro;40m for 2023. This early announcement that funding has been secured will allow schools several extra months to plan for a summer programme next year.</p>  <p>  The programme has gone from strength to strength with 2022 seeing more schools and more students participate than ever before. Final figures for this year&rsquo;s programme will be known later in the year but based on the information available to date, it is anticipated that over 45,000 pupils will have participated with over 1,000 schools running a programme. </p>  <p>  I am however very conscious that parents want this programme to be available in more schools in 2023 and, as part of the planning that has already begun for next year, it is a priority for me that children in Special Schools have access to a school-based programme. I am committed to the on-going development of the Summer Programme with a view to ensuring that children with the most complex needs have access to a scheme. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the 2022 programme with a view to improving it for next year and with a committed focus on increasing the number of schools participating, particularly schools serving children with very complex needs.</p>  <p>  In 2022 the Department had productive engagements with the National Association of Boards of Management for Special Schools (NABMSE). This led to positive initiatives to assist special schools such as through the hosting of information webinars and the introduction of a new grant for these special schools. I expect that these engagements will lead to more positive measures for the 2023 programme and beyond.</p>  <p>  Following the review of this year's programme and finalisation of planning for next year, the details of the 2023 Summer Programme will be published at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></reply>

In relation to such posts, schools and ETBs have autonomy in relation to the recruitment and replacement of staff within the agreed approved staffing allocation granted to the school in question and subject to relevant procedures and criteria set out in circulars from my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides each ETB with an administrative and maintenance staffing allocation and associated pay budget to support its individual ETB schools and head office. It is the responsibility of each ETB to recruit and manage staffing levels within this allocation, including the assignment of such staff to the different functional areas in the ETB in accordance with the needs and priorities of the organisation. In line with the position across the public sector generally, every ETB must also operate within overall approved staffing and pay budgets for its administrative and maintenance staff.</p>  <p>  In relation to ancillary staff in schools, ETBs have discretion to temporarily employ a substitute for existing ancillary staff in schools who are temporarily absent due to sick leave etc. where the temporary absence would otherwise result in either no secretary, caretaker or cleaner being in the school on the day(s) in question; and where the ETB can fund the temporary employment of the substitute from within its existing pay budget for non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  However, ETBs are required to seek prior approval from my Department for new posts or to replace existing sanctioned administrative and maintenance posts, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. In considering such requests, my Department will consider factors such as the particular circumstances and need arising for the ETB concerned and will also have regard to the affordability of the post, or replacement post, within the administrative and maintenance pay budget of the ETB itself and within the relevant pay budget for the ETB sector as a whole.</p>  <p>  I can confirm over recent years that my Department has, as resources permitted, granted a significant number of additional administrative and maintenance posts to the ETB sector. In that regard, in the period since 2015, my Department has increased the number of approved posts in Head Offices by 29% across the sector.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that the vast majority of replacement Head Office administrative posts sought by ETBs are granted by my Department. For example, since 2017, 85% of such requests have been granted.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to supporting ETBs and will continue to work closely with individual ETBs and with the sector collectively to ensure they are adequately resourced to deliver their important work.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes.</p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year.</p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>We have seen 392 new special classes being sanctioned by the NCSE for this school year , bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level. This included the sanctioning of 100 new special classes in the Dublin region. A list of all special classes sanctioned by the NCSE is available on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>For 2023, budget funding provides for a further 370 special classes to open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023. </p><p>My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. This work involves a detailed review of statistical data in relation to forecasting demand for special class places, consideration of improved data sharing arrangements and a particular focus on the provision of special classes at post-primary level.</p><p>At local level, the NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already over 125,000 tickets have issued for the 2022/2023 school year. At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600  children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, a 20% overall increase.  There has been an increase of 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the current school year, has led to some delays in issuing tickets.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible. </p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July.</p>  <p>  It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  The School Transport Scheme is a demand led scheme, as numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year, it is not possible to provide specific information until all applications have been processed.  Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process a small number of remaining on time applications, where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants. </p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. The review of the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments. </p>  <p>  While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. The Steering Group will continue to report to the Minister on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes.</p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants.

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes.</p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year.</p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>We have seen 392 new special classes being sanctioned by the NCSE for this school year , bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide.

The measure will eliminate the cost to families for all school books at primary school, including workbooks.</p>  <p>  Now that funding has been secured, my Department will engage with the education partners to roll out the measure in time for the September 2023 school year. The implementation of the measure will build on the existing school book rental scheme, the free school books pilot provided to over one hundred schools in recent years and the planning work already commenced.</p>  <p>  The Free Book Scheme will be available to all recognised primary in the free education sector. There is no funding for any educational establishments outside of this category.</p>  <p>  It is planned that funds will be provided to schools to purchase school books and classroom resources. Schools will be encouraged to seek the best value for money when procuring school books and related classroom resources. Schools buy books directly from school book retailers at present as part of the implementation of the school book rental scheme. Ninety-six percent of primary schools participate in the book rental scheme.</p>  <p>  Guidance on the procurement of books will be developed as part of our further engagement process with schools, parent and management bodies and other stakeholders on this measure.

It is expected that this right will be upheld by schools on foot of a parental request.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron and published on the schools website. The act requires where schools provide religious instruction that they clearly set out in their admission policies the school&rsquo;s arrangements for students, where the parent or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, has requested that the student attend the school without attending religious instruction in the school.</p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion instruction classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. On occasion there can be practical issues around supervision and arranging class times and these have to be considered by schools at local level and worked through in a pragmatic way.</p></reply>

At post-primary level some 74% of school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2029, with most expected to reach a peak within the next two or three years. </p><p>In the latest published primary and post-primary schools' enrolments national projections (www.gov.ie/en/collection/projections/ ), the CSO population projections (based on 2016 Census data) were used.

The Report shows that overall, 91.5% of the students who entered first year in 2014 sat the Leaving Certificate examination in 2019 or 2020 or were provided with calculated grades, while 97.6 % sat the Junior Certificate examination in 2017 or 2018. The retention rates for Co. Carlow in these figures was 96.7% to Junior Certificate examination and 87.5% to Leaving Certificate. As the total cohort in some counties was small the retention rate can fluctuate based on small changes from year to year.</p>  <p>  DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of my Department to address educational disadvantage at school level.  My Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students.</p>  <p>  In March this year I was glad to be able to announce a major expansion of the DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme. This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This expansion included 12 Co. Carlow primary schools who were added to the programme for the first time and 2 primary DEIS schools who were reclassified and will receive additional supports. This means that in the 2022/23 school year there are 17 Primary and 3 Post Primary DEIS schools in Co. Carlow.</p>  <p>  Schools participating in the DEIS programme have seen retention rates to Leaving Certificate improve since the introduction of DEIS. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed from a gap of 16.8% for the 2001 entry cohort to approx. 8.6% for the 2014 cohort.</p>  <p>  All DEIS post-primary and DEIS urban primary schools are provided with access to supports from the Home School Community Liaison coordinator scheme, the School Completion Programme and an Educational Welfare Officer. </p>  <p>  In the DEIS programme, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) seeks to promote partnership between parents, teachers and community family support services. The overarching goal of the HSCL Coordinator is to improve educational outcomes for children through their work with the key adults in the child&rsquo;s life to promote attendance, participation and retention in school.  All DEIS post-primary and all DEIS urban primary schools in Carlow have access to a HSCL coordinator.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a targeted school and community support service. The desired impact of SCP is retention of a young person to completion of the leaving certificate, equivalent qualification or suitable level of educational attainment which enables them to transition into further education, training or employment. </p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service work with children and families who have difficulties in relation to school attendance, participation, retention. This is a statutory service and its primary role is to ensure that every child either attends school regularly or otherwise receives a certain minimum education; to ensure and secure every child&rsquo;s entitlement to education. There are currently 2 Education Welfare Officers providing services to all schools in Co. Carlow. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. Conscious of this and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, my Department is now working to explore the allocation of resources to schools across the education system, DEIS and non-DEIS, to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Universal Design for Learning is a framework that facilitates the inclusion of all learners to access the school curriculum in a meaningful way.</p><p>A core value of the curriculum, across all levels of schooling in Ireland, is inclusivity and diversity. The curriculum at primary and post-primary is for all learners, from all backgrounds &ndash; regardless of gender, socio-economic background, race or creed. In the context of a universally designed curriculum, inclusive education and diversity encourages a move away from thinking in terms of ability and disability to thinking about variability, competency and opportunity.</p><p>It is concerned with the best interest of every child considering that each child varies in their competency, language, family background, age, culture, ethnic status, religion, gender and sexual identity. It promotes equity of opportunity and participation in which each child has meaningful engagement and challenge in learning and positive interactions with peers and others in the school community.</p><p>The <i>Primary School Curriculum</i>is currently under review and redevelopment. In February 2020, the NCCA published proposals for a redeveloped curriculum in the form of a <i>draft Primary Curriculum Framework</i>. The review and redevelopment is supported by extensive research and consultation. Consultation has included input from education stakeholders/partners to include those who advocate for children with special educational needs. Children were also consulted as part of the process on what they liked, disliked, and would change about learning in school.</p><p>The new Primary Curriculum Framework seeks to enable high-quality learning experiences for all children in primary and special schools. It is expected that the new Primary Curriculum Framework will be provided to the Department from the NCCA in January 2023 with publication in March 2023. This framework will then guide the NCCA&rsquo;s work in developing a specification for each curriculum area.</p><p>In relation to school buildings, I wish to advise the Deputy that the provision of modern, accessible school accommodation is a priority for my Department.  This is in two respects: firstly in ensuring that there is sufficient provision for pupils with special education needs and secondly in designing school accommodation that meets the needs of all users - students and staff - and enhances the learning experience. </p><p>In addition to the specific accommodation provision for students with special education needs, the principles of universal design are embedded in all of my Department's technical guidance for school building projects, for the benefit of all school building users.  The General Design Guidelines includes guidance on the principles of Universal Access as part of a whole school design approach.</p><p>Further to this, updated technical guidance on Post Primary School Design, Specialist Accommodation for Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Sanitary Facilities were published 2021. A suite of such Technical Guidance Documents is published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie. Such guidance draws on feedback from school authorities and reviews of a sample of completed projects. These practical and helpful guides provide very clear guidelines and approaches to be taken by school authorities in re-purposing/refurbishing existing accommodation for special education needs provisions, as well the establishing new classrooms of varying sizes.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. </p>  <p>  There were a number of different funding streams available as part of Budget 2023 and it was a very significant achievement to have secured &euro;9.6 billion for Education for many ground-breaking investments in our education system, furthering the work of recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting the achievement of all our students.</p>  <p>  A rise in the cost of living should never be a barrier to education. I am very pleased therefore to have the support of my colleagues in Government to ensure this remains the case and as part of the cost of living measures I have secured &euro;90m for additional capitation funding in 2022. </p>  <p>  All recognised Primary and Post-Primary schools in the Free Education scheme will benefit from this additional capitation funding in 2022 which represents circa 40% of current standard and enhanced capitation rates.</p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils enrolled in recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no requirement to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. </p>  <p>  Section 64 of the Education (Admissions to schools) Act 2018, which was commenced in 2018 explicitly prohibits the charging of admission and enrolment fees for admission to or for continued enrolment in a school.</p>  <p>  In the context of the current cost of living crisis and the additional funding being made available to schools I would expect that schools will not have to seek additional voluntary contributions from parents.</p></reply>

It will be a number of weeks before the total number of teachers and SNAs who participated on the home-based programme will be known but so far 3,328 teachers and 956 SNAs have been paid on the system to date who catered for over 6,000 pupils. </p>  <p>  Over the last two years, schools have been given the flexibility to engage staff that are not currently employed in their schools, including those in the early-years sector, to run their summer programme, along with provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating in the summer. In 2022, this was further expanded to allow Route 5 undergraduate student teachers to participate. Since 2020, the home-based programme has been expanded to permit SNAs to support pupils. </p>  <p>  The Department is very conscious that parents want this programme to be available in more schools in 2023 and, as part of the planning that has already begun for next year, it is a priority that children in special schools have access to a school-based programme. The on-going development of the Summer Programme is committed to ensuring that children with the most complex needs have access to a scheme. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the 2022 programme with a view to improving it for next year and with a committed focus on increasing the number of schools participating, particularly schools serving children with very complex needs.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>My Department utilises a Geographic Information System (GIS) to support its strategic planning for capital investment.  Where the geo-spatial assessment of demand and capacity in an area indicates that additional provision is required my Department considers the options of extending the capacity of a school or schools, or of providing a new school or schools.  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; for example a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. There are currently in excess of 300 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p><p>The current status of approved projects is listed on a county by county basis on <i>www.gov.ie</i>and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages.</p></reply>

In the 2021/2022 school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost of the scheme in 2021 was &euro;289m. </p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. Already over 125,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to mainstream applicants for the new school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>   Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>   In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  In addition to issuing emails, a strong emphasis is placed on advertising the closing date through both website and social media platforms.  Bus &Eacute;ireann advertised the closing date through their website and social media platforms. The closing date was also advertised through the Department of Education, Public Representatives and other forms of media channels. </p>  <p>  The email notifications that are issued are intended as a reminder but are not required for a ticket request to be made.</p>  <p>  it is important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p></reply>

My department is working actively with the NCSE and other key stakeholders on a more refined planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year. In 2023 for example, we have secured funding which will allow us to open a further 370 special classes, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p>  <p>  The Department is also acutely aware of its obligations arising from Article 24 of the UNCRPD and the need to develop an inclusive education system.  The Department also recognizes the need to meet increased demands on the NCSE following the reported increase in prevalence rates of children with complex needs. Also of note is the likely additional demand for specialist provision which will arise from changes in the Assessment of Need process</p>  <p>  NCSE resourcing was last considered in the context of the Government Memorandum on NCSE re-structuring in 2019. This established a permanent regional structure consisting of ten teams organised into five regions. The NCSE has reviewed its capacity to meet the significant and increasing demands placed upon it. This has been done in the context of the changing requirements on the NCSE and the legitimate and significant concerns being expressed by families and their representatives regarding access to resources special Education Needs Advisors.</p>  <p>  The number of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) has remained unchanged for many years, despite exceptional growth in the special education in that time. This has meant that the number of special classes, SNAs, SET teachers and special schools being supported by each SENO has increased exponentially over time.</p>  <p>  The increase in the NCSE funding for 2023 will allow for significant expansion of their capacity to enable them to meet the current and future needs of SEN appropriately. My Department and I will be engaging with the CEO of the NCSE to ensure that there is effective planning to allow for the recruitment and deployment of new staff next year in a coherent and efficient manner. In this regard I expect any workforce planning to focus on what will be needed to have a visible and effective presence in our schools and with our parents and children guiding and supporting them on their educational journey.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p>  <p>  In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p>  <p>  For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p>  <p>  My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level. 100 of these new special classes are being provided in the Dublin region. The NCSE advise my Department that there are sufficient special class places available at primary and post-primary level at the start of this school year 2022/2023.</p>  <p>  For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023. My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. This work involves a detailed review of statistical data in relation to forecasting demand for special class places, consideration of improved data sharing arrangements and a particular focus on the provision of special classes at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Schools are also engaging directly with parents and are working to support children as they plan their transition into these new special classes. The NCSE is also providing training and other support as necessary to schools.</p>  <p>  NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>  <p>  It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

The zoning on the site reserves 60% of the site for "open space&rdquo; &ndash; that is, it cannot be built upon.  The overall site is circa 10 acres. My Department made a submission to the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Draft Development Plan 2022-28 in April 2021 seeking to have the zoning on the school site changed from Objective F Open Space to Objective SNI purposes (Sustainable Neighbourhood Infrastructure) &lsquo;to protect, improve and encourage the provision of sustainable neighbourhood infrastructure&rsquo; which would have effectively removed the 60% open space requirement.  However this submission was unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  The campus project has been assigned to my Department&rsquo;s Design &amp;amp; Build delivery programme which uses a professional external Project Manager to progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning, tender and construction.  There have been a number of pre-planning consultations to date with the Local Authority with regard to the permanent accommodation which will inform the development of the planning application documentation.   </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department submitted a planning application for interim accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy on the permanent school site. When planning permission for the interim accommodation has been secured, my Department will update the school in relation to the programme for delivery of the interim accommodation in conjunction with progressing the planning application for the permanent school accommodation.</p></reply>

This policy will build on the achievements of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education.</p><p>A steering committee has been established with representatives from the following relevant Government Departments and Agencies to oversee the development of the policy:</p><p>- The Department of Education</p><p>- The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth</p><p>- The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media</p><p>- The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science</p><p>- The Inspectorate </p><p>- An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG)</p><p>- Foras na Gaeilge</p><p>- The Teaching Council</p><p>- The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)</p><p>- National Council for Curriculum and Assessment </p><p>- National Council for Special Education.</p><p>Planning is underway for a public consultation process to take place in the coming months to gather the views of stakeholders, including young people, their parents, school staff and leaders, and Irish-language stakeholders. </p><p>An Advisory Committee with relevant stakeholders will be established at a later stage to support implementation of the policy.</p><p>I look forward to progressing this important work of strengthening Irish-medium educational provision and building on the positive outcomes already being achieved in the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education. I also look forward to working with relevant stakeholders in the development of this policy.</p><p>In February 2021, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) launched a consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. The timeframe for this consultation was extended from the end of August to the end of November 2021, in order to facilitate greater stakeholder engagement in the process. This extension of the closing date has also allowed the NCCA to conduct an early enactment review of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 and L2 subject specifications.</p><p>Findings of the consultation on the draft Leaving Certificate Irish specifications, L1 and L2, and the findings from the early enactment review of Junior Cycle Irish specifications, L1 and L2, will be considered at the next meeting of the NCCA Council. At this point, the NCCA will advise on next steps in the development of the Leaving Certificate (established) Irish curriculum.</p><p>Following a very comprehensive review of the implementation of circulars on exemptions from the study of Irish, my Department published circulars in 2019 revising circulars in place since the 1990s.  The review comprised research carried out by the Inspectorate on implementation in schools and internationally as well as a public consultation process which saw over 11,000 responses to the survey and some 100 written submissions including from key stakeholders.  </p><p>More recently, my Department has carried out an initial review of the implementation of the 2019 circulars on exemptions from the study of Irish based on a desk based research and held briefing sessions on its proposals with key stakeholders.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>  It was a very significant achievement to have secured &euro;9.6 billion for Education in Budget '23. This will enable many ground-breaking investments in our education system, furthering the work of this government in recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting achievement of all our students.</p>  <p>  A rise in the cost of living should never be a barrier to education. I am very pleased therefore to have the support of my colleagues in Government to ensure this remains the case and as part of the cost of living measures I have secured &euro;90m for additional capitation funding.</p>  <p>  All recognised Primary and Post-Primary schools in the Free Education scheme will benefit from this additional capitation funding in 2022 which represents an increase of circa 40% of current standard and enhanced capitation rates.</p>  <p>  The additional grant will be paid at the rate of &euro;75 per pupil at Primary level and &euro;113 at Post-Primary level. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with Special Educational needs. Arrangements are being made to issue this this payment as soon as possible and schools can use this to cover additional energy costs and other increased day to day operating costs. </p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured in recent years that centrally negotiated rates were made available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels through frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). A significant number of schools signed up to these and are availing of highly competitive energy prices. The Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p>  <p>  I also want to draw attention to the Budget 2023 announcement of funding from the Climate Action Fund in relation to the provision of Photovoltaic (PV) Panels in schools up to 6KW output.</p>  <p>  This is really positive news and will assist with their energy needs and costs along with supporting the decarbonisation of our schools.</p>  <p>  My Department officials are working closely with Department of Environment, Climate and Communications colleagues in relation to the arrangements for this scheme and details will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

While the issue of pay alone will not resolve these issues, the Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services, and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and the taxpayer. There is an important balance to be struck between maintaining industrial peace and protecting the Exchequer.  </p><p>The value of public pay deals to the Government and the taxpayer is ensuring that pay costs are managed in a sustainable and orderly way and in a climate of industrial peace. By and large public pay agreements have delivered on these objectives over the last 12 years.  Following the conclusion of discussions on 30 August, the parties to Building Momentum, with the expert assistance of the WRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals, to extend the terms of Building Momentum to 31 December 2023. These proposals have now been ratified by public service unions and associations representing the public service workforce. In addition to the 1% increase due in October 2022 under Building Momentum, the  extension of the agreement will provide for a further increase of 6&frac12; % over the lifetime of the agreement.  The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. This will rise to over &euro;41,000 under the extended agreement. Overall, teachers will see increases from &euro;3,200 to &euro;5,600 under the extension of the agreement. </p><p>In recent years my Department has established a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers at both post-primary and primary levels, including the introduction of new programmes of initial teacher education and teacher upskilling programmes in targeted subject areas and the Teaching Transforms campaign, which encourages young people to follow a career in teaching. </p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools, including 29 base schools covering the Dublin area. </p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <b><i>Sub Seeker</i></b>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>The Teaching Council is also currently processing applications for registration from newly qualified teachers, who will represent a new source of supply in 2022/23. In excess of 3,400 primary and post-primary NQTs are registered to date with almost 40 further applications currently in progress.</p></reply>

The section 37A process is only used as a measure of last resort where additional provision is required in a specific location and efforts to secure that additional provision through engagement with schools has failed. </p>  <p>  The new act also streamlined Section 67 which provides for a situation where a child (with special needs or otherwise) cannot find a school place and allows the National Council for Special Education or Tusla (Child and Family Agency) to designate a school place for the child.</p>  <p>   All sections of Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 have now been commenced. </p></reply>

New POR threshold tables are produced each year to distribute these PORs equitably across all school.  Currently one in three teachers hold a promotional post within our schools. The Sectoral Bargaining process under Building Momentum for the primary sector has been used to further increase posts of responsibility (POR) in primary and special schools by an additional 1,450 posts in the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Circular 0044/2019 &ldquo;Recruitment/Promotion and Leadership for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary Schools&rdquo; issued in August 2019. This circular replaced circulars 0063/2017, 0070/2018 and Appendix D and E of the School Governance Manual for Primary Schools 2015-2019. </p>  <p>   Distributive leadership incorporates a flexible structure in schools and allows for effective delegation of leadership roles across senior and middle leaders. Leadership is thus distributed throughout the school as a key support for student learning. </p>  <p>  The circulars allow for greater flexibility in the assignment and re-assignment of roles and responsibilities to Assistant Principals. This will afford school management greater flexibility to respond to the individual needs and priorities of their school.</p>  <p>  In line with the principles of distributed leadership, Assistant Principals will work in teams in collaboration with the Principal and/or Deputy Principal and have shared responsibility, commensurate with the level of the post (i.e. Assistant Principal (AP) I or II), for areas such as  - learning and teaching, leading school development (including curriculum development), pupil support including wellbeing, leadership/management and development of individuals and staff teams.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the circulars all post holders are accountable to the Board of Management/ ETB for the fulfilment of their roles and responsibilities. This is provided for in the &ldquo;Report and Review&rdquo; section of the circulars which are in 12. of Circular 0003/2018, section 11. of Chapter 2 of Circular 0044/2019 and section 14. of Chapter 4 of Circular 0044/2019. An annual review is carried out each year in post primary and at regular intervals, but at a minimum of every two years in primary.  </p>  <p>  Consultations are currently underway with the Educations Partners in relation to a revised circular to update the post primary Circular 0003/2018.</p></reply>

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage.

The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.

While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.

The EPSEN Act 2004, is now in place for more than 18 years and there have been many significant changes and developments to policy relating to the education of children with special needs in that time.  </p><p>The purpose of the review is to ensure that legislation on education for students with additional needs is up-to-date, fully operational, and reflective of the lived experiences of students and families.</p><p>A number of steps have been taken by my Department in relation to this important review of legislation. Establishment of a Steering Group, Working Group and Advisory Group have been completed and all the groups have held initial meetings. </p><p>A full stakeholder engagement took place on the 21st June last, to discuss concerns and proposals in relation to this review, which was very positive. A large amount of work has occurred over the summer months to prepare categories of public surveys and a consultation paper to inform members of the public of the review. It is intended to launch the public survey within the coming weeks. Focus groups will be organised at the conclusion of the public survey to explore key themes that arise as result of the survey analysis. </p><p>In depth engagement has also occurred with the NCSE in relation to specific research that shall assist with this review. </p><p>Open collaboration and consultation will be at the heart of the review and all stakeholders will be invited to engage with the process.</p><p>I wish to reassure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensure that every child receives an education to help him/her achieve his/her potential.  To this end, the state has made very significant investment in a range of education supports for these children.  The state has also put in place a comprehensive legislative framework to protect and support the educational rights of these children and their families.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the purpose of the review is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative basis for the educational provision, both current and planned, for children with special educational needs in order to protect the interests of the children concerned and their families and those of the state.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. </p>  <p>  Aligned with this policy, a number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health.</p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  To support schools in this work the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently providing training to schools to ensure that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school. Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools. These seminars will be supported by two webinars and in-school visits.  </p>  <p>  - Following the publication by the National Education Psychological Service (NEPS) of guidance for post primary schools on establishing a Student Support Team or reviewing an existing team, psychologists are currently facilitating post-primary schools to improve the Student Support Team process.  Student Support Teams are the structure through which key wellbeing and wellbeing-related policies are implemented in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. </p>  <p>  - NEPS will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed a number of resources to support the wellbeing of children and young people from Ukraine enrolling in schools in Ireland.  This includes:</p>  <p>  Revised Guidance for primary and post &ndash; primary schools in relation to supporting the wellbeing of children/young people from Ukraine at this time. This includes support for students with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Guidance for Parents and Carers from Ukraine on Supporting the Wellbeing of their Children</p>  <p>  A model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) to help teachers support students. The document is called Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link.</p>  <p>  NEPS has also delivered a series of wellbeing webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools.</p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p>  <p>  While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  I am pleased to confirm that we will invest more than &euro;5 million in piloting a programme of counselling supports for primary school students. This will serve to support the very positive work which already takes place in the area of wellbeing in our schools. </p>  <p>  I also announced in the budget, an additional 54 educational psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes as part of budget 2023. </p></reply>

The programme will see up to ten schools benefitting from a selection of energy efficiency works.</p><p>This programme continues to assist the Department to explore options and test various solutions for decarbonised energy efficiency solutions in our broad range of school building types. It is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger schools national programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan and will play a key part of meeting delivery of the Climate Action Plan.</p><p>Design teams are being appointed to each of the schools to feasibility stage to investigate retrofit and decarbonisation options, and works will roll out from summer 2023 subject to the outcome of the feasibility stage. The feasibility stage includes looking at various options for potential retrofit levels with renewable heat up to what would be required to be a Zero Emission Building. </p><p>The schools for 2023 present a variety of challenges, including building age, archetype and retrofit requirements. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.</p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 42 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 15 schools currently at various stages of progress. </p><p>The general principles and approach to school selection include schools meeting Energy Monitoring and Reporting requirements and demonstrating a strong and holistic commitment to energy management practices through participation in the Energy in Education Programme. The programme selection also seeks to enable various cross sections of school types and sizes, energy consumption profiles and different elements of construction type and heritage/ conservation requirements where specific learnings are being targeted. The pathfinder programme is thus delivered on broad assessment in line with the above considerations and not on an application basis. </p><p>The schools for the 2023 programme are:</p><p>Leixlip Community School, Kildare </p><p>Catherine McCauley Special School, Limerick </p><p>Carnadonagh Community School, Donegal </p><p>St Joseph&rsquo;s National School, Kingcourt, </p><p>Presentation Girls Primary School, Maynooth </p><p>Holy Rosary School, Wicklow</p><p>Hazelwood College, Limerick</p><p>St Colmcille&rsquo;s Community School, Dublin</p><p>Scoil Thomas Primary School, Castleknock, Dublin</p><p>St Nessan&rsquo;s National School, Limerick</p></reply>

At the time of the adoption of the Decision, there was no consensus among the Members to cover also COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.  </p>  <p>  As a compromise, paragraph 8 of the Decision stipulates that no later than six months from the date of that Decision (17 December 2022), Members will be expected to decide on whether to extend the Decision to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>  <p>  Trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, and accordingly the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  The EU is in the process of conducting internal consultations and analysis on the extension, taking into consideration that the case for COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is more complex than the one pertaining to vaccines.  </p>  <p>  Discussions on the extension of the mechanism to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are ongoing in the WTO and the EU is engaging constructively in these discussions. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other Member States on the EU position.  A decision to extend the earlier Ministerial Decision from June 2022 will require the agreement of all WTO Members.</p></reply>

One of the principal reasons for Ireland&rsquo;s investment in ESA programmes is to nurture and build a base of technologically sophisticated enterprises that develop and trial technology solutions via space applications, and then go on to develop new markets in a wide range of application areas based on the expertise they have built up, such as in other high reliability sectors such as automotive and aerospace.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the global space economy presents real commercial opportunity to Irish companies.  It was estimated to be worth over $350 billion US dollars in 2020 and prior to the COVID-19 crisis, it was expected to grow to $1 trillion US dollars by 2030.</p>  <p>  ESA is the only access point for Ireland&rsquo;s space active industry to develop and qualify their space technologies.  Engagement with ESA creates a unique opportunity for Irish companies to win a share of the overall space economy. It complements national supports to Irish industry and offers a unique pathway to access highly specialised facilities and knowledge.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s annual contributions, funded by my Department to ESA from 2002 to present date cumulatively is just over &euro;325 million (including a direct contribution by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;2.5M in 2021 to support specific industrial development activities). </p>  <p>  ESA operates on the basis of &ldquo;geo-return&rdquo;, meaning a proportional amount of the money invested into ESA is returned to Irish businesses to develop and build new technologies.  In that regard it is noted that Ireland currently has 97 space-active companies with ESA contracts and is well on the way to meeting the objective set in the National Space Strategy for Enterprise 2019 &ndash; 2025 of supporting 100 companies to benefit from ESA engagement.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in line with the commitments made in the National Space Strategy for Enterprise we have seen a significant increase in co-funding from industry in this sector. This represents a positive trend and is indicative of the growing strength of the space-active sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  We expect to pass a significant milestone in the coming months with the launch of EIRSAT-1, Ireland's first satellite, built by a team in UCD with support from Irish industry and ESA.  This poses many commercial and educational benefits, and recognises our ambition in this sector.</p>  <p>  Significant new opportunities are also emerging for enterprise to use satellite-derived data to develop high value services which can support policy making decisions, enterprise development and address global challenges, including climate change.</p></reply>

The solar PV pilot grant scheme transitioned to the MSS scheme in February 2022, and the minimum BER C3 requirement was removed and the eligibility of homes was changed from those built prior to 2011, to those built prior to 2021. This has already significantly increased access to the scheme.  New houses must be in compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations, which relates to the energy performance of buildings requirements. There are options to meet this requirement under the standard by including heat pumps and/or solar PV. Targeting the grant scheme at existing homes ensures that the grants available through the SEAI maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. Since 2018, the SEAI has supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes, and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that grant applications will exceed 12,000 in 2022 alone. While the level of interest in the MSS indicates that the scheme is working well, its operation and effectiveness will, like all such schemes, be kept under review and adjustments made where necessary. </p></reply>

This is currently the case and will continue to be the case under the newly redesigned scheme which is being introduced in January 2023. The redesigned scheme was informed by an extensive public consultation which was held in March/April 2021. Regulations to underpin the new scheme will be published very soon and guidance sessions and further detail for obligated parties in relation to the operation of the scheme will be available then. The Government recognises the importance of shallow measures in reducing household energy demand and this is reflected in the enhanced grant rates of 80% which are available specifically for these types of measures (i.e. attic insulation and cavity wall insulation) since February of this year.

To maximise the impact of the ongoing green and digital transformations, it is vital that we safeguard a secure, open, stable, and free cyber space from the ever-growing threat of malicious activity. My Department is pursuing a number of strategies to achieve this, including a suite of legislative steps to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s cyber security.  The Government agreed that the General Scheme of a Bill be prepared for Government approval, to establish the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on a statutory basis. Legislation is currently being drafted to provide a mandate and authority for the NCSC, and to set out its role with respect of other agencies engaged in national security functions. My Department is developing a scoping paper to inform the drafting of Heads of Bill, which will follow early in 2023.</p>  <p>  In November 2021, the Government agreed a number of measures to enhance the security of electronic communications including 5G networks. The Government has endorsed the 'EU 5G Security Toolbox' as the framework by which Ireland will secure its next generation electronic communications networks. A series of Electronic Security Control Measures have been drafted in consultation with industry, and legislation has been brought before the Oireachtas to establish a legal basis for these controls. The Department will bring forward primary legislation on 5G security to assess the risk profile of providers of electronic communications network equipment and, if required, to designate certain vendors as being high risk. The legislation will also provide for certain parts of electronic communications networks to be designated as being critical and certain powers which would ensure that high risk vendors would not be used in critical electronic communications networks.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 30 September 2022, over 337,000 premises are design completed and over 94,500 premises can order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 25 counties, with over 85,000 premises passed across 23 counties and available for immediate connection. Construction is underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with or exceeding projections. </p>  <p>  The network rollout for the NBP is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to reach every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. Villages, townlands and counties may be covered by a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for the rollout across county areas.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Sligo and County Leitrim through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed and connected to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 749 BCP sites have been installed by NBI to date and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Sligo, 9 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date with 11 sites installed in County Leitrim. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  In County Sligo, some 21 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access, with 9 now installed in County Leitrim. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high-speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p>  <p>  In relation to the BCP located at Killenummery Hall, Co. Leitrim, NBI have advised that the reason houses in the area cannot be connected is due to the fact that neither NBI nor any commercial operator has a fibre network in the area. BCP connections are very specialist, do not require fibre and are provided as a temporary measure until NBI completes the rollout in the area.</p></reply>

Heat pump heating systems are most efficient when they operate in homes with a low level of heat loss. The metric used to determine whether the dwelling has a sufficiently low level of heat loss is the &ldquo;Heat Loss Indicator&rdquo; (HLI).</p>  <p>  Homeowners that apply for SEAI heat pump grants are required to undergo a technical assessment to ensure that the home has a suitably low HLI. This is to ensure the new heat pump system is appropriate for the home and protects the homeowner from excessive heating costs. This requirement applies to all homes regardless of the existing heating system. There are no plans to remove this requirement at this time. </p></reply>

The projected funding for the Avoca remediation project in 2023 is &euro;450,000.  This funding will provide for ongoing monitoring, maintenance and health and safety works on the Avoca old mine sites.  In 2023, the Department also intends to begin reviewing the outstanding remediation plan from the 2008 feasibility study and undertake an update to reflect more recent technological methods and advances in mine site remediation and update projected remediation costs since the last costs were produced in 2008.</p></reply>

This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance. </p>  <p>  There are 12 One Stop Shops registered and SEAI is supporting another 10 organisations through the registration process. Once a company successfully passes the two-stage registration process and the SEAI recommendation is approved, an appointment letter is issued to them.</p>  <p>  Under the NHEUS, homeowners engage an SEAI registered One Stop Shop (OSS) to manage the grant application process and oversee delivery of the retrofit on their behalf. Homeowners and their OSS agree a contract whereby works must be completed by the OSS within 12 months. To date, 645 homes have been approved for One Stop Shop home energy upgrade grants. This points to a strong pipeline of works for the coming months under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The cost of bringing an individual home to a Building Energy Rating (BER) B2 is determined by a number of factors including the size and type of home as well as the starting condition of the home. The Department estimates that the cost can range from &euro;14,000 to &euro;66,000.</p>  <p>  The types of works applied for, and the grant support available, under the Scheme are informed by the Home Energy Assessment undertaken by the One Stop Shops. Most recent figures from SEAI show the average OSS home energy grant offer is &euro;20,500, however it is important to note that this average may fluctuate depending on the applications submitted to the SEAI. Feedback from the SEAI shows that measures most requested to date are windows, doors and heat pumps.  </p></reply>

The  scheme is part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will be co-funded by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Exchequer funding. It will also be backed by a counter guarantee provided by the EIB. The loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. This approach will signal to the banking sector, new sustainable business opportunities associated with retrofit and the transition to a low carbon economy as well as increasing the volume of retrofit activity within the State. It is anticipated that the Scheme will provide a lending portfolio of up to &euro;500 million.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made to date with the "Invitation for Pre-Qualification Stage" to identify interested "On-Lenders" concluded and the "Invitation for Award Stage" underway. This is an important milestone in the development of the scheme as it will determine how much of the guaranteed loan portfolio will be allocated to each "On-Lender". It will also set out the interest rate pricing approach under the scheme. It is expected that the loans under the guarantee will be available early next year.</p></reply>

This is how microgeneration can help consumers shield against electricity costs. While there is potential for payment for any excess electricity, export is an additional benefit. Maximising consumption will also shorten the payback period for their investment.Responsibility for the regulation of the Electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is an independent regulator accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas. The CRU published a decision for the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff in December 2021, which outlines arrangements for implementation of the tariff, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis which must be reflective of the market, or wholesale, value of the electricity, in line with the requirements of Article 21(2)(d) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. It is important to note that a key aspect of the eligibility criteria for the CEG is that microgenerators must meet the definition for &lsquo;renewables self-consumers', as per the Renewable Energy Directive. This places a focus on generating electricity for one's own consumption and thereafter with an entitlement to receive remuneration for excess electricity fed into the grid. </p><p>  This remuneration is different to the retail electricity market and the prices a domestic electricity consumer is charged by their supplier. Retail prices take account of the cost to purchase electricity on the wholesale market, while covering the operational costs of the company, as well as the network charges required for use of the electricity grid. As such, retail electricity prices and CEG remuneration tariffs cannot be compared on a like for like basis.</p><p>  In budget 2022, the Minister for Finance announced an exemption from income taxes for remuneration from the CEG for domestic consumers, up to a maximum of &euro;200 per annum; which is expected to cover the majority of annual remuneration from the CEG tariff in 2022. </p><p>CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them to raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply. </p></reply>

Legal requirements govern all vehicles placed on the market in EU Member States, including in Ireland. Manufacturers are obliged to meet a set of safety, environmental and conformity of production requirements, known as motor vehicle type-approval, before placing a vehicle on the EU market. Every vehicle produced must be accompanied by a certificate of conformity, in which the manufacturer certifies that the vehicle corresponds to the approved type. The vehicle can be registered anywhere in Europe and Ireland cannot refuse to register a vehicle which has been type-approved without being in breach of our obligations to uphold the free movement of goods in the EU.</p>  <p>  The design, manufacture and fitting of catalytic converters and replacement converters are subject to EU type-approval regulations, which apply the standards set out in UNECE Regulations 83 and 103.</p></reply>

As you are aware, a draft national EV charging infrastructure strategy, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 195,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication later this year.</p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well as assisting in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.</p><p>However, there is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible, such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging and workplace charging. </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022.</p><p>In terms of progress ESB eCars have:</p><p>One hub of 4 High-Powered Chargers with 8 charging bays constructed, with 2 in progress.  There is an overall target of 6 sites</p><p>One hub consisting of 2 High-Powered Chargers with 4 charging bays completed with a further 10 currently in design/construction.</p><p>16  hubs of 1 High-Powered Charger and 1 Fast Charger with 3 charging bays completed with a further 9 currently in design/construction.</p><p>Completed the upgrade of 40 Standard 22kW chargers to DC Fast 50kW chargers</p><p>Completed the replacement of 250 Standard 22kW AC chargers.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles.  Further information on Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland is available at  www.gov.ie/zevi.</p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, provides local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. It should be noted that this scheme facilitates the installation of standard charge points.</p><p>My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p><p>Thirteen local authorities have been in touch with SEAI in relation to the Public Points Scheme including Cork County Council. However no application has been submitted to date. Cork City Council have not contacted the SEAI in relation to this scheme.</p><p>ZEVI is currently accepting pilot project proposals from interested Local Authorities to trial EV charging infrastructure installations and to assist local authorities to evaluate future charging strategy.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>Public charge points in Ireland and provided by a number of chargepoint operators on a commercial basis. ESB eCars is one of these operators and has a significant presence nationwide. In light of ESB eCars role in providing publicly accessible charge points, I have forwarded your question for direct response. Please contact my office if no reply is received within 10 working days.</p></reply>

In order to be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for use as a goods vehicle and must be used solely for the carrying of goods in the course of trade or business.  It may also be used for the conveyance of employees in the course of their employment.</p>  <p>  An application to tax a vehicle at the goods rate of motor tax must be made to a motor tax office on first taxing and it is a matter for the motor tax office to determine eligibility for the goods rate.

This includes the key requirement of requisite professional competence, which is a public interest sectoral requirement in a road safety context.</p>  <p>  The professional competence requirement is satisfied where an operator designates a natural person to act as &ldquo;transport manager.&rdquo; The transport manager will continuously and effectively manage the transport operations of the licence holder. To this end, the transport manager must:</p>  <p>  - be of good repute</p>  <p>  - hold an appropriate qualification granted by an EU/EEA Member State</p>  <p>  - reside in the territory of the EU/EEA</p>  <p>- have a genuine link to the licence holder undertaking or be externally engaged on the basis of a written contract</p>  <p>  Following Brexit, the natural person previously designated by Mr Fitzpatrick to act as transport manager no longer satisfied all of the criteria set out in the European Regulation. The Department has engaged extensively with Mr Fitzpatrick on this matter and in July 2022 proposed to suspend the operator licence for continued non-compliance with licensing requirements. Mr Fitzpatrick has made representations to the Department indicating that he misunderstood the timeline within which remedial action should be taken. In these representations, Mr Fitzpatrick requested that the Department allow him until end of November 2022 in order that he can return to compliance with licensing requirements. This request was granted by the Department.  Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 1071/2009 allows for a maximum time limit of 6 months to return to compliance in respect of professional competence, as a result no further extension is possible. Where an eligible natural person is not designated transport manager by end of November 2022, the Department is required by the European Regulation to suspend the licence from 1 December 2022 until Mr Fitzpatrick again demonstrates requisite professional competence requirement. It remains open to Mr. Fitzpatrick to procure the services of an external transport manager, even on a temporary basis, in order to comply with licensing requirements.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  The Young Adult Card (YAC) was initially introduced on PSO services in May. Following extensive engagement between my Department, the NTA, and representatives from the commercial bus sector the initiative was broadened to include participating Commercial Bus Operators (CBOs) on the 4th of September. As a result, holders of a YAC or Student Leap Card can now avail of the 50% fare discount on both PSO and CBO services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of eligibility requirements for the YAC, I am happy to clarify that the NTA are widening the age rules of the Scheme to allow 16, 17, and 18-year-old students in third level education to apply for the Student Leap Card so that they can also avail of the discount. This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA have already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a Student Leap Card and avail of the discount.</p></reply>

Cash handling introduces additional complexity, including security, safe storage, transfer to banks and reconciliation, that the Road Safety Authority wished to avoid as part of the new service. Alternatives are readily available, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or Payzone vouchers. Payzone vouchers can be purchased from retailers in towns and villages nationwide (over 3,500 outlets).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that retail transactions are governed by contract law in Ireland. In this context, where a business places no restrictions on the means of payment it is prepared to accept, it must accept legal tender when offered by a customer to settle a debt that has arisen. However, if a business specifies in advance that payment must be in a form other than cash, the customer cannot subsequently claim a legal right to pay in cash, even if that cash is legal tender. Therefore, under certain circumstances, retail businesses or service providers can refuse to accept payment in cash.</p>  <p>  Any customer requiring personal assistance to use the NDLS service is welcome to be accompanied by a person who can make a payment on their behalf. For people aged over 70, there is no charge for a driving licence. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The national car and van fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.</p>  <p>  The SEAI grant scheme aims to encourage behavioural change and support the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030. The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  2,548 home charger grants were paid out in 2019 at &euro;600 per grant totalling &euro;1,528,828. If the home charger grant increased to &euro;850, based on the number of grants paid in 2019, a total of &euro;2,165,800 would be required. However the Deputy should note that home charger grant applications have increased greatly in the last few years with 9,202 home charger grants already paid out this year to end August 2022. The cost of this to the exchequer has been just over &euro;5.5 million. If the grants were increased to &euro;850, the equivalent cost would have been &euro;7.8m. </p></reply>

I understand that the centre to which Deputy McDonald refers is a registered charity. It is my intention that charities and sporting bodies registered for tax in respect of trading income will be included in the scope of the scheme.  The scheme will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will operate on a self-assessment basis. Businesses will be required to register for the scheme and to make claims within the required time limits.</p><p>It is proposed that the scheme will operate by comparing the average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021. If the increase in average unit price is more than 50% then the threshold has passed and the business is eligible for support under the scheme.A business who has not seen an increase of 50% over the period will not be eligible for the scheme.</p><p>Once eligibility criteria are met, the support for businesses will be calculated on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in the bill amount. A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 per trade will apply and an overall cap will apply on the total amount a business can claim in accordance with the State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework.</p><p>Where a business meets all of the criteria for the scheme, they may apply for support under the scheme subject to the applicable caps. </p><p>The operational details of the scheme are being worked through by officials and will be available soon. </p><p>The Deputies will also note that in this Budget 2023 speech, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform acknowledged that not-for-profit and voluntary organisations in the Arts, Sports, Gaeltacht and the Community and Voluntary sector, are woven into the fabric of community life across Ireland, but they are very vulnerable to the severe impact of increased energy bills. As such, he is making &euro;60 million available in 2022 to ease the pressures in these sectors. The framework for this assistance will be put in place in the next few weeks to ensure that they benefit this year.</p></reply>

As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, in 2021 the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The paper is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The TSG paper noted that changes to the tax arrangements for remote working may give rise to issues of deadweight loss and economic inefficiencies, as well as equity issues in the personal income tax system. The paper also noted that in the context of a whole of Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, it may be considered appropriate to enhance or amend the current tax arrangements in order to underline and reinforce public policy decisions in this area.</p>  <p>  Taking these factors into consideration, as announced in Budget 2022, the tax arrangements for remote working were enhanced and formalised in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home, and at the same time it ensures that the traditional burden of employer related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and the wider body of taxpayers.  In addition, I would point out that, as the current deduction relates to a proportion of the cost of the relevant expenses, the amount that may be claimed will increase as those expenses increase. There are no immediate plans to further increase the tax relief for working from home.</p>  <p>  With regard to cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  A Budget package of &euro;6.9 billion was recently announced, as well &euro;4.1 billion of one-off measures, which included the provision of energy credits for all households. This is in addition to &euro;3 billion of measures that were implemented before the recent Budget.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the six medical criteria.</p>  <p>  The Minister has no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  Two Expression of Interest campaigns have been held seeking suitable candidates for the Board.

As there were insufficient suitable candidates arising from the first campaign, a second round was issued with a closing date of 5th July 2022. From these, three suitable candidates have been identified and are being Garda vetted; it is hoped to interview two further candidates very shortly. Five members are legislatively required for a functional Board with a quorum of three needed for any appeal hearing.</p>  <p>  Once these processes have been completed for all candidates the Minister for Finance will then be in a position to appoint any suitable Department of Health nominee to the Board.

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,250 (&euro;1,500 in the case of e-bikes), for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  From 1 August 2020, this exemption was increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 for expenditure incurred by an employer in connection with the provision of a bicycle and/or bicycle safety equipment in respect of any one employee. A higher exemption limit of &euro;1,500 applies in the case of the provision of an electric bike (which may also include bicycle safety equipment). These increases and the change to a 4-year period from a 5-year period were in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p>  <p>  Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. Therefore, the Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment and thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed, retired individuals, or those in receipt of social welfare payments, such individuals cannot qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee.</p>  <p>  Further guidance regarding the Cycle to Work Scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which prevents Member States from doing so.</p><p>Minister Fleming is currently undertaking a round of high-level engagements with stakeholders in the insurance sector, and is raising with them the issue of thatched roof properties, amongst other &lsquo;pinch point&rsquo; areas of cover.

All queries regarding this project should be directed to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Officials in my Department are continuously engaging with insurance providers and are monitoring ongoing developments in this specific area.</p><p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government, and that it is my intention to continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy.</p></reply>

There is no differentiation between different types of coal with regard to the rate of SFCT that applies. This means that smokeless, low smoke, and smoky coal all attract the same SFCT rate, currently &euro;107.98 per tonne. SFCT rates are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-licences/energy-taxes/solid-fuel-carbon-tax/rate-of-tax.aspx. VAT at 13.5% is also applicable to coal and this is applied on top of the consideration and SFCT.</p>  <p>  SFCT is not an import duty and neither the movement of solid fuel into the State, nor its physical presence in the State, generate a liability to SFCT; it is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that SFCT becomes liable. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Revenue cannot impose any barriers to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of the harmonised excise regimes: mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol.</p>  <p>  Where a solid fuel supplier based in the State sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they must register with Revenue to account for and pay SFCT. Where a supplier based outside the State brings solid fuel into the State for supply direct to consumers, they must register with Revenue for SFCT. Similarly, suppliers based outside the State who deliver solid fuel into the State to a private individual, must register with Revenue and pay the tax. This means that suppliers from outside the State, including Northern Ireland, who take orders for delivery to private individuals in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. Approximately 5% of solid fuel suppliers registered for SFCT are based in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Where an individual personally purchases solid fuel outside the State and accompanies that solid fuel into the State, they do not have an SFCT liability provided the fuel is for their own private use. However, if that individual, instead of using the solid fuel themselves, supplies it to another person in the State, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to pay SFCT and must register with Revenue accordingly.</p>  <p>  Currently in Northern Ireland there is no carbon tax on solid fuel and this factor combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate give rise to price differentials which can incentivise the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland. Revenue is aware of the concerns expressed by suppliers about cheaper coal entering the State from Northern Ireland. Where a person suspects, or has evidence, that a solid fuel supplier, based in the State or in NI (or, indeed, elsewhere), is not paying SFCT on first supplies of solid fuel they should report any information to Revenue, and this can be done by contacting Revenue&rsquo;s Confidential Freephone 1800 295 295. As is the norm with all self-assessed taxes, Revenue addresses non-compliance with SFCT law on a risk basis and, where appropriate, utilises relevant powers of enforcement to collect the tax. However, as already outlined Revenue cannot impose any barriers to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Bringing solid fuels that do not comply with Ireland&rsquo;s environmental standards into the State does not constitute a Revenue offence. While Revenue (as the tax authority) cannot impose any obstacles to the free movement of solid fuels into the State from other Member States and Northern Ireland, such imports are open to challenge by Local Authorities (as the relevant authority responsible for enforcing environmental standards) if the fuel does not meet environmental standards in this State. I understand that placing such fuels on the market, distributing them, selling them and burning them in the State are actions that must comply with a regulatory regime which operates under the Air Pollution Act 1987. Last year the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Mr. Eamon Ryan T.D., announced the introduction of significant enhancements to the regulatory framework dealing with domestic solid fuels from October 2022. The Minister indicated that his Department would support local authorities to ensure implementation of the most effective model of environmental enforcement for the enhanced regulatory regime.</p>  <p>  While Revenue does not have a direct role in relation to these environmental enforcement matters Revenue has participated in several joint operations with other agencies including Local Authority solid fuel inspection teams, with a view to checking for compliance across several tax headings, including SFCT.</p></reply>

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to review it.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to support the long-term economic viability and survival of the participants/businesses concerned.  The Deputy will be aware that, under the scheme, participants can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of 2022, or until 30 April 2023 for businesses impacted by the public health restrictions introduced in December 2021.  To remain eligible for the scheme and to avail of the significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum that applies to the repayment of the warehoused debt, returns must be filed for all periods covered by the scheme and current taxes must be paid as they fall due.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the total debt eligible for the Debt Warehousing Scheme since its introduction is &euro;31.9 billion, and 256,000 businesses have availed of the scheme at various stages during the scheme&rsquo;s duration. However, as at end August 2022, almost 92% of that debt has been paid, leaving a balance of &euro;2.65 billion currently in the warehouse in respect of approximately 78,600 individual entities. </p>  <p>  There is no obligation on businesses to start repaying their warehoused debt until January 2023 (or May 2023 for those entitled to the extension) although, some businesses are paying some or all of the debt as their financial circumstances permit. </p>  <p>  Revenue will engage with the majority of businesses who have debt in the warehouse in advance of end December 2022 to agree tailored arrangements appropriate to the individual business circumstances to deal with the debt. For the small number of customers who qualified for the warehouse extension due to the public health restrictions introduced in December 2021, Revenue will engage with these customers in advance of end April 2023.  </p>  <p>  I know that Revenue fully appreciates the challenge for businesses in paying their outstanding liabilities in a difficult economic and financial climate.  Revenue has a strong track record of successfully working with individuals and businesses who engage early to resolve their payment difficulties, and, in most cases, a mutually satisfactory solution is found without resorting to debt collection/enforcement sanctions.</p></reply>

The Roadmap set out the need to promote long-term pension saving to address income adequacy in retirement, in particular for low income earners.</p><p>The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance, and includes representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the Department of Social Protection (DSP); the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and the Pensions Authority. In 2020 the IDPRTG published a report which set out a number of actions to aid in the harmonisation and simplification of supplemental pensions. Finance Act 2021 introduced a package of measures to give effect to some of the actions set out in the group&rsquo;s report.</p><p>The Group continues its work to implement the actions set out in the Group's Report. Accordingly, a number of proposals from the 2020 Report are currently being worked on, some of which are technical in nature and others which have wider policy implications necessitating careful consideration through the normal policy channels. One of these actions, designed to aid in the harmonisation and simplification of supplemental pensions, is:</p><p><i>&lsquo;The differential treatment of the PRSA for funding purposes should be abolished, employer contributions to PRSAs should not be subject to BIK.&rsquo;</i></p><p>As indicated in this year&rsquo;s Tax Strategy Group paper www.gov.ie/en/collection/d5b41-budget-2023-tax-strategy-group-papers/ one of the pension policy issues actively being considered is to abolish the differential treatment of the PRSAs for funding purposes.</p><p>The IDPRTG focused closely on this issue during the course of 2022, examining a number of methods that could be used to achieve equalisation of the funding options for occupational pension schemes and PRSAs. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Finance Bill each year contains a combination of items announced in the Budget and a number additional items which are not included in the Budget for various reasons.  It is my intention to publish the Finance Bill on the 20th of October subject to the agreement of the Government in advance of that date.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the measures that may be included in the Finance Bill in advance of Government decisions on these measures.</p></reply>

The Standard Rate Cut-Off Point, which is the entry point for the higher rate of income tax, is being increased by &euro;3,200 from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000 for a single individual (8.7% increase), with commensurate increases in the bands applying to married persons and persons in civil partnerships. The main personal tax credits (personal credit, employee tax credit and earned income credit) are also being increased by &euro;75 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,775 (4.4% increase), and the home carer tax credit is being increased &euro;100 from &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700 (6.3% increase).</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC will also be increased in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.50 to &euro;11.30 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link - www.gov.ie/en/publication/ccc22-budget-2023-taxation-measures/</p>  <p>  I will bring forward legislative amendments in Finance Bill 2022 to give effect to the above measures from 1 January 2023. These measures will apply to all taxpayers, including persons aged over 65, as appropriate to their individual circumstances and income levels.</p>  <p>  Separately, there is an income tax age exemption for persons aged over 65 which means that single, widowed or surviving civil partners aged 65 or older do not pay any income tax if they earn less than &euro;18,000 per annum with a threshold of &euro;36,000 in place for a married couple or civil partners where one person is 65 years of age or older. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.  </p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, Budget 2023 did not include an increase to the current thresholds for the age exemption. While I have no plans to change the thresholds in relation to exemptions currently granted to persons aged 65 and over, it must be noted that the current tax arrangements for persons aged 65 or older compare favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners. Reduced rates of USC also apply for persons aged 70 or older where their total income is &euro;60,000 or less.</p>  <p>  Additional guidance on the range of tax credits and reliefs that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.</p>  <p>  With regard to cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. A Budget package of &euro;6.9 billion was recently announced, as well &euro;4.1 billion of one-off measures, which included, for example, the provision of energy credits for all households. This is in addition to &euro;3 billion of measures that were implemented before the recent Budget.</p></reply>

I am aware of this issue, which is a sensitive one for many in our community.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, this important policy matter is being considered at EU level. The European Commission&rsquo;s 'Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan' includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), <i>via</i>a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;. Earlier this year, the Commission published an exploratory study on &lsquo;Access to financial products for persons with a history of cancer in EU Member States&rsquo; as a first step in this process.</p><p>Following the publication of this study, the Commission has stated that by the end of 2022, it will launch further work that will gather more evidence and insights on the issue. This will serve as a basis to design a first draft of the EU Code of Conduct, which the Commission plans to discuss with stakeholders, as part of implementing 'Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan'.  </p><p>It is understood that the EU Code of Conduct is planned to be adopted by early 2024. My Department will continue to monitor any outputs from this work, which represents an important contribution to this issue, and will continue to engage with Insurance Ireland and other stakeholders regarding relevant developments in this area.</p><p>Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that, as regards existing domestic legislation, Section 126 of the <i>Consumer Credit Act 1995</i>permits lenders here to provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain life insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. This is important to note in the context of securing a home loan for individuals who may experience difficulties acquiring mortgage protection insurance, including people who have recovered from cancer.</p></reply>

The services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauticians, are subject to the 13.5% rate.</p>  <p>  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; items.  As the services provided by beauticians are part of these parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.</p></reply>

VRT on Category A vehicles (generally passenger cars and certain Special Utility Vehicles) is assessed based on the value of the vehicle and its emissions levels for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The VRT on Category B vehicles (generally light commercial vehicles and motor caravans) is assessed at 13.3% of the value of the vehicle. In all cases, a vehicle&rsquo;s value is determined in accordance with particular provisions in the law. The ownership of the vehicle does not affect the VRT calculation, and the tax law does not restrict company owners from purchasing vehicles.</p><p>The appropriate category for a particular vehicle is decided at the time of its registration based on the vehicle&rsquo;s technical categorisation under EU type approval law, taking account of the documentation presented at the time of registration including its EU Classification.</p><p>A category B vehicle is defined in the Finance Act based, in large part, on EU type approval classification N1. It is defined as meaning:</p><p><i>&ldquo;(a) a category N1 vehicle that has three seats or less,</i></p><p><i>(b) a category N1 vehicle to which a BE bodywork code has been assigned, or</i></p><p><i>(c) a motor caravan&rdquo;</i></p><p>As the Deputy&rsquo;s query relates to a new five-seater vehicle, the vehicle concerned is unlikely to fulfil the criteria of a Category B vehicle and so, under the legislation would be a category A vehicle.</p><p>If the taxpayer concerned wishes to contact Revenue regarding the specific vehicle, they can contact the National VRT Service on the Revenue website via My Enquiries.</p></reply>

Direct tax is a Member State competence and tax decisions are taken by unanimity.</p><p>Pillar Two of the OECD Agreement seeks to introduce a minimum tax rate for multinational enterprises across the globe.  The EU Minimum Tax Directive, which introduces a minimum tax in the EU, will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework by ensuring there is a consistent and coordinated application of the minimum tax rules across EU Member States.</p><p>Although political agreement has not yet been achieved on the Minimum Tax Directive, I am fully supportive of the Czech Presidency's efforts to resolve this and it remains my belief that the Directive will be agreed by all Member States in the near term.</p><p>I am aware that some are frustrated at the pace of progress and would prefer to proceed with this legislation using the enhanced cooperation provision of the EU treaties. </p><p>I do not see the merit of pursuing a legislative proposal through enhanced cooperation. It is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest to have the Directive agreed by all EU Member States.

Among other things, Indecon was asked to: examine best practice in other jurisdictions; develop policy options to enhance the connection between national lottery sales and the allocation of funding to good causes; monitor and report on the impact of funding allocated; and identify new areas for funding allocations.</p>  <p>  I believe that work on finalising and submitting the report is close to completion and I understand that the report will be available for my consideration in the near future.  I will bring the Report to Government and publish it thereafter.</p>  <p>  Full consideration of the report will provide a useful basis for the consideration of any legislative initiatives regarding the National Lottery.</p>  <p>  Any legislation such as that at issue in the question would need to be compatible with EU law. Specifically, there is the challenge of addressing the issue of proportionality in justifying a complete ban on a previously legitimate and legal business activity that has been in place for years. There would be a need to show overriding reasons to justify a complete ban as a non-discriminatory and proportionate means of achieving legitimate objectives in the public interest. It seems likely that some very considerable work would be necessary to mitigate and manage any legal risks that could arise in respect of any such legislation. </p>  <p>  The European courts seem to have been very strong in their view that raising public funds does not by itself constitute a legitimate reason for governments to take actions in regard to the rights of lottery competitors to trade. This is no small issue that would have to inform the drafting of any legislation along the lines of that suggested in the question.</p>  <p>  The issue of any legislation that had the effect of prohibiting bookmaking firms  operating betting on the National Lottery therefore needs careful assessment and analysis and will require consultation with the Attorney General.</p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. On foot of that process, consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.14 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May.</p>  <p>  The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital projects, and &euro;166.6 million for the 2020 round in total, represents the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  </p>  <p>  Following completion of the appeal process, my Department commenced a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP. Drafting of the Review is at an advanced stage and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  Following the completion of the Review, I will announce the exact timing of the next round but it is hoped to have it open for applications early in the new year. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000. The change reflects the movement in rents in recent years in these areas and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in the respective bands.

The report that you refer to has been superseded by <i>'A Living tradition: a strategy to enhance understanding, minding and handing-on of our built vernacular heritage'</i>, which I launched last December. </p><p>Action 6 of this strategy deals specifically with thatch. Under this action, my Department is working to resolve the urgent issue of availability and affordability of insurance for thatched buildings and to examine other relevant issues including thatching standards, fire prevention guidance, and the availability of appropriate thatching materials.</p><p>My Department has commissioned an expert report on the question of thatch insurance. An interim report was received at the end of September with the final report due at the end of November. My Department has begun to examine the approaches suggested by the interim findings and will be prepared to act quickly on the findings of the final report in November.</p><p>At present my Department estimates that there are approximately 2,000 older vernacular thatched houses in Ireland. My Department is in the process of establishing a national survey of thatched buildings which will determine the overall position more precisely and make possible an accurate county-by-county breakdown.</p><p>Under Action 4 of the strategy my Department will be assessing the efficacy of grant aid programmes for vernacular buildings, and the Department&rsquo;s thatching grant will form part of this assessment. All of these activities are intended to improve the situation for thatch owners.</p><p>Under my Department&rsquo;s grant scheme for the renewal or repair of a thatched roof, funding of up to &euro;6,350, or up to 80% of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser, may be payable in respect of necessary works to renew or repair the thatched roofs of private houses situated on the mainland where the private owner holds a medical card. A higher level of assistance of up to &euro;8,252 is available for houses on specified offshore islands, where the owner holds a medical card. In the case of private owners without a medical card, funding of up to &euro;3,810, or two thirds of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser, may be payable in respect of necessary works to renew or repair the thatched roofs of private houses situated on the mainland, rising to &euro;5,714 where the house is situated on a specified off-shore island.</p><p>In addition to the thatch repair grant, my Department provides financial support for the protection of eligible heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS). Details of the 2023 schemes will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Included in this is the unprecedented level of support provided by central Government to local authorities in respect of the COVID -19 pandemic. The payments in 2020 also included an additional allocation to Galway of &euro;1m; funding that was linked to the operation of municipal districts, and in 2021 an additional allocation of &euro;600,000 for discretionary income was made.</p>  <p>  For 2023, the Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;333 million to support local authorities.  A large portion of this figure (&euro;199 million) will be towards assisting local authorities with the cumulative effect on pay costs arising from the National Pay Agreements and the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. This allocation will ensure that local authorities will have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform their functions and provide essential public services to our citizens; in excess of one thousand services in fact.  Furthermore, as has happened in previous years, we will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.  The pay allocation for Galway County Council for 2022 is &euro;4.4m. The 2023 pay allocation for Galway County Council, which will be in excess of the 2022 allocation, will be determined and notified to the local authority shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department is very aware of the current financial environment in which local authorities, including Galway County Council, are now operating and, in recognition of the ongoing pressures, support of &euro;60m has been secured to assist the sector.  It should be noted that this funding is additional to the &euro;333m outlined above, and its purpose will be to provide additional support to assist local authorities in meeting the increasing costs involved in providing a wide range of services.  The individual allocations of additional support under this scheme and any other additional support to be provided are currently being finalised and the allocation for Galway County Council will be notified to the local authority shortly.</p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of Local Property Tax (LPT) will take place in 2023. All Equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline. Local authorities may also vary their LPT rate by up to 15%; authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, while local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income. Galway County Council has opted not to avail of this opportunity to raise additional locally sourced income since 2018. The council could have benefited from an additional &euro;2.15m in 2023 if it had applied the additional 15% upward local variation in the same manner as many other authorities. Galway County Council will receive &euro;155,561 in LPT equalisation funding for 2023 in addition to an expected &euro;14,362,329 LPT yield to achieve a baseline funding of &euro;14,517,890.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that it is intended to commence a comprehensive review of the current LPT baselines in the coming months. This review could not commence in time for the 2023 LPT allocation process without reliable and up-to-date data, primarily the detailed census data. The overall funding position of Galway Co Council and all local authorities will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All.</p><p>Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p><p>On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p><p>On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p><p>When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it. Feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been very positive, with 276 applications reported at start October.</p><p>Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas.</p><p>Both schemes under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will continue to be for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence. Officials in my Department are working with the Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority in the coming weeks to update the details of the Grant, with a view to the expanded scheme being available in November.</p><p>VHOs in each local authority will be available to provide advice and information on the schemes and the application process.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p><p>- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p><p>- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;</p><p>(ii) in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and</p><p>(iii) can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant. </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities, including information on social housing acquisitions. This data is available until the end of Quarter 2 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/</i>.</p><p>My Department does not hold data on the occupation status of properties acquired for social housing. This information may be available from individual local authorities. </p><p>Copies of the circular letters were provided to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p></reply>

This momentum will continue with delivery significantly increasing in 2023. </p><p>A delivery target for 2023 was set in Housing for All of 5,500 affordable homes for affordable purchase and cost rental across the various delivery streams. In implementing Housing for All, each local authority has now prepared a Housing Delivery Action Plan for 2022 to 2026.  18 local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to include planned affordable housing delivery in their Action Plans.  I have also set five-year Affordable Housing delivery targets for those local authorities.</p><p>Local authorities have been asked to begin collating information on delivery of affordable homes in their area in the same manner as is currently done for social housing. It is intended that information on delivery across all delivery streams will be gathered by my Department and I expect that my Department will be in a position to begin reporting on affordable delivery in national quarterly delivery statistics later this year. </p><p>A pipeline of affordable housing delivery is also being developed by local authorities. Furthermore, a number of local authorities are currently working on submitting advance purchase proposals to my Department and I anticipate that activity in this area will increase further going forward. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which is expected to bring essential more long-term stability to the Irish housing market.  It is also tasked with unlocking stalled private, planning-consented developments in the shorter-term through its market engagement initiative - Project Tosaigh.</p><p>The target under Project Tosaigh is the delivery of 5,000 new homes in the years 2022 to 2026 for affordable cost rental or sale to eligible households under affordable purchase arrangements. The LDA has advised my Department that they are nearing the completion of phase 1 of Project Tosaigh and will be in a position to provide details as to where these developments are shortly.</p><p>The Q2 2022 Housing for All progress report detailing proposals and progress on the LDA's active sites over both the short and long term can be accessed on the following link:  <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/03335-housing-for-all-q2-2022-progress-report/</i>.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Property directly occupied by any Department or Office of State is exempted under paragraph 12A(a) of the schedule. </p>  <p>  While each case must be considered on its merits, this exemption would not apply where an individual or organisation has a contract to provide a service on behalf of a Department or Office of State. In such circumstances, the individual or organisation providing the service under contract is deemed to be in rateable occupation and consequently the property would be rateable. </p>  <p>  There are a number of options available to an occupier of a rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, as amended. Firstly, before a determination is made, they may make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

In order to secure the future of the heritage assets and employees, Shannon Group has had extensive engagement with the relevant local authorities since early 2021. Shannon Heritage ended their management contracts with An Post and Fingal County Council for sites in Dublin on 31 December 2021 and the transfer of the business and employees took place without issue. King John&rsquo;s Castle was successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April.  </p>  <p>  Shannon Group continues to engage with Clare County Council in relation to the proposed transfer of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen, Knappogue Castle, and Cliffs of Moher Retail Outlet. As part of its engagement with Shannon Group, Clare County Council identified a funding gap for which it sought Government assistance to enable it to take over the sites.  The funding gap identified by Clare County Council is &euro;15m (&euro;5m a year for 3 years), the quantum of which may be adjusted downwards partly due to the better than projected performance of visitor numbers to Bunratty Castle in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Department of Transport established an inter-departmental working group in May 2022 to examine funding options in relation to the proposed transfer to Clare County Council of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen, Knappogue Castle, and Cliffs of Moher Retail Outlet. The group includes officials from the Departments of Transport, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public expenditure and Reform, the Office of Public Works, and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media. To date, the working group has met three times, and identified a number of ways to support a transfer. The Department of Transport has also met with Clare County Council and Shannon Airport Group and has asked both to continue their engagement and consider the package of measures identified by the inter-departmental working group, with a view to reaching agreement on a transfer.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have met officials from Clare County Council on a number of occasions over the past 12 months in relation to the proposed transfer, the latest meeting was in July of this year. At this meeting my Department recognised the current financial environment in which local authorities are operating, and the pressures facing them in respect of general inflation and higher energy costs in particular.  These challenges are common across the sector and my Department highlighted its wider responsibility to ensure that all local authorities can continue to deliver services, whilst managing limited resources. </p>  <p>  It was also noted that Clare County Council were in receipt of support from the Local Government Fund of almost &euro;3m in 2021 and 2022 to compensate for loss of commercial rates at Money Point Power Plant and that my Department would seek similar support for Clare County Council for 2023.  Across all schemes and funding sources my Department provided &euro;65.9m in 2020, &euro;82.9m in 2021 and &euro;24m to end August 2022 to Clare County Council.  Included in this is the unprecedented level of support provided by central Government to local authorities in respect of the COVID -19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have liaised with Clare County Council regarding the potential for some support from the Local Government Fund towards the year end.  Equally, subject to submission of a suitable proposal and costings, funding towards National Monuments service approved conservation works at Bunratty Castle could be considered by the Heritage Division of my Department. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will continue to engage with the inter-departmental working group and Clare County Council to support progress in the transfer of the remaining Shannon Heritage sites to Clare County Council.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.  </p><p>My Department does not fund any homeless service directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.  Under Exchequer funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources. Furthermore, housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the Exchequer funding arrangements provided by my Department. Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the type and operation of homeless services including details of service providers are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum. </p><p>Exchequer funding for homeless services is provided through my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis.

We have provided funding to <i>Education Cannot Wait</i>which provides education in emergency contexts and has approved a dedicated Pakistan response.</p><p>Ireland is also working with our EU and UN partners to provide humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the effects of the flooding on the most vulnerable in the country.  The EU is providing &euro;32 million in funding to address the most urgent needs such as basic shelter, clean drinking water and sanitation, food and nutrition, and medical services. EU Member states, including Ireland, are collectively providing &euro;93 million, bringing the overall <i>Team Europe</i>support to over &euro;120 million.  In addition, the EU's Copernicus satellite service has been activated to collect data to support the response and is providing a mapping service to the Pakistani authorities. Ireland also contributes significant amounts of funding to both the UN Central Emergency Response Fund and the IFRC Emergency Response Fund. Both of these funds have been utilised to respond to this crisis. The Central Emergency Response Fund has provided funding of over US$10 million to help meet needs on the ground.</p><p>On behalf of the Government, I have written to my counterpart in Pakistan to express Ireland's condolences on the loss of life and our solidarity, outlining the steps Ireland has taken to support Pakistan's recovery from this tragedy. Ireland will continue to engage closely with Pakistan at this very difficult time and will monitor developments through our Embassy in Ankara and the Honorary Consul in Karachi.</p></reply>

Tourism Ireland is represented in Mumbai by a local contract agent.  The Consulate is a two diplomat mission, supported by three local staff. </p>  <p>  The Consulate provides consular support and assistance to Irish citizens in India, including those in difficulty, as well as a range of consular services. It also works to create opportunities for Irish companies seeking to do business in India, and opportunities for trade with, and investment in, Ireland by Indian businesses.  It hosts events for the clients and key contacts of the Irish State Agencies at Ireland House, and supports Irish exporters in terms of entering the Indian market. </p>  <p>Together with the State Agencies, the Consulate coordinates programmes for visiting Ministers, including to mark Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day earlier this year. It participated in a number of engagements at the invitation of local authorities to celebrate the 75th anniversary of India&rsquo;s independence. The Consulate undertook a social media campaign highlighting the links between our respective independence movements, building visibility for Ireland, and strengthening our bilateral relations. </p>  <p>  The Consulate is actively working to promote Ireland as a filming location for the Indian film industry, and to identify opportunities to raise the profile of Ireland through Irish culture. It has collaborated with the State Agencies and with the Ireland India Business Association and Cricket Ireland on promoting Ireland during the Ireland-India T20 cricket matches in Ireland in June 2022.</p></reply>

The key sectors of interest are food and food ingredients, aviation services, software, medical devices, tourism and education.  A small but growing number of Irish firms are operating in Indonesia. </p>  <p>  There is almost daily communication between Department officials in Headquarters with the Mission and with our Ambassador to Indonesia. I am kept fully informed of the Embassy's work by my officials. Formal bilateral consultations, at official level, will take place later this month.</p>  <p>  Although I have not met directly with our Ambassador this year, last April we both attended the first in-person Heads of Mission conference since the Covid pandemic. The conference was a wonderful opportunity for us to renew in-person engagement with Ireland's Ambassadors and Consul Generals from around the world.  </p>  <p>  Now that international travel has again re-opened,  I look forward further opportunities for political engagement with Indonesia,  which is critical to the maintenance of our strong bilateral relations.</p></reply>

The Act provides a legal basis for the various policies and procedures that are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate or naturalisation certificate. However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in certain situations such as marriage, or civil partnership, where civil or legal documents are available to verify this change.</p>  <p>  Applicants who wish to change their name on their passport arising from marriage or civil partnership must submit their original civil marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate. These applications are complex due to the change of name and are currently taking up to the 15 working days expected for an adult online complex renewal. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service does not accept deed polls to change the name on a passport.</p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises other than by marriage or civil partnership, the Act requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two-year period.</p>  <p>  The question of what a person&rsquo;s name is, at any given moment in time, depends upon its usage and the evidence to support the constant and sustained use of this new identity. Evidence of this for at least two years through documentation such as bills, bank statements or official correspondence, is required as a deed poll is not adequate evidence of the constant use of a new name. This policy seeks to protect the integrity and security of Irish passports against passport and identity fraud while allowing for genuine cases where name changes have occurred.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport currently ranks sixth in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p></reply>

However, I am aware of the many initiatives in place to recruit individuals to the Reserve. </p>  <p>  While the commitment to restoring the strength of the RDF is not in doubt, given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority. I would add also that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Nonetheless, RDF recruitment will continue to be progressed to the greatest extent possible.  </p>  <p>  Supports currently provided to maximise RDF recruitment include use of social media, promotion through the DF Press Office, outreach activities by RDF members, and the use of Permanent Defence Force (PDF) exit interviews, which contain information on applying to the RDF. </p>  <p>  A RDF recruitment campaign was opened, for online applications, on 21 March 2022 and was closed on 28 July 2022. Over 1000 applications were received during this window and a number of eligible applicants are undergoing recruitment processing. On completion of all processing and assessments, successful applicants will be inducted into the RDF for recruit training. </p>  <p>  To date 70 RDF recruits have been inducted into the Defence Forces from this recruitment campaign.</p>  <p>  In July this year, Government approval was given for a move to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on the Defence Forces. This will result in the Defence budget rising from &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, in 2022 prices, by 2028, the largest increase in Defence funding in the history of the State. </p>  <p>  Some specific initiatives include the establishment of an Office of Reserve Affairs with the priority objective of developing a regeneration plan for the Reserve Defence Force.  In this context, a High Level Action Plan (HLAP) was approved and will give the underpinning for these actions to be progressed.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that that the Government remains fully committed to the advancement of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF).</p></reply>

Its aim was to provide information to Irish industry and research institutions with a view to identifying opportunities to collaborate on future projects.   </p>  <p>  The event was in support of Irish companies, especially SMEs, and Irish research institutions who are engaged in the development of technologies that enhance the capabilities of the Defence Forces and keep them safe, whether they are on missions and operations overseas or undertaking their range of duties at home in Ireland.  These companies and research projects also create high-level employment across Ireland and export cutting edge technology around the world.  </p>  <p>  The event was well attended by Irish companies and research institutes, including the higher education sector. Contributors included the European Commission (Directorate General for Defence Industry and Space), the Association of Finnish Defence and Aerospace Industries and the Irish Defence and Security Association. The event also involved a number of Irish and European enterprises sharing their experience of the wide-ranging opportunities that there are for Irish research institutions and industrial entities in the security and defence domain, particularly for exploitation of dual use technologies. This included a small number of companies which exhibited some of their products. </p>  <p>  The event follows on from the 2021 publication by my Department and the Defence Forces of a Feasibility Study which, inter alia, identified the value of having a research technology and innovation capability within the Defence Organisation that focuses on technologies at lower technology readiness levels (TRL) that have broad potential utilisation in both the civil and security and defence spheres and on leveraging innovations from the civilian sector in a manner that offer potential benefits for our Defence Forces as well as for industry and academia. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) Unit in Defence will set a new strategic direction for Defence innovation and collaboration in Ireland by driving internal innovation in the Defence Organisation and contributing to the development of a security and defence dual-use innovation eco-system. The Defence RTI Unit will also support Irish enterprise and research bodies in accessing EU funding streams, including through the European Defence Fund and the European Defence Agency and their engagement with European networks and SMEs across the EU.</p>  <p>  Supporting Irish research and enterprise in accessing funding and in exploiting opportunities in capability development in the security and defence domain, and participation by such entities in such research and development opportunities, does not compromise Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  These initiatives do not involve Ireland becoming a member of a military alliance nor a participant in any  mutual defence arrangements. I am satisfied that this event was consistent with Ireland's foreign policy, including our participation in the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy and our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the NEPS Support and Development service reaches an estimated 25,000 teachers annually.</p><p>A working group in the Department has been examining the matter of how the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) can continue to recruit adequate numbers of suitably qualified staff and continue to respond to the educational psychological needs of children in primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p><p>The group has agreed on a number of actions that must be taken to address supply issues in the medium to long term. These include the development of a workforce plan for educational psychologists within the Department of Education and work has begun with other Government Departments to advance this.</p><p>A number of options were considered to address some immediate supply issues.  Following analysis of these, it was decided that the Department would use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third year students of the Educational Psychology Doctoral programme in University College Dublin (UCD) and Mary Immaculate College (MIC) University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022/23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.  The workforce planning group referred to above will be asked to make some interim recommendations in Q2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of their final report. It is envisaged that funding supports for students on the educational psychological doctorate programme will be considered as part of this process.</p><p>In the interim, given the particular time pressures for students in third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students of Educational Psychology, currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023.

My Department continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to give effect to that commitment.</p><p>A revised Junior Cycle SPHE specification, including RSE, was published for public consultation in July, with a view to being finalised by the end of the year so that it can be rolled out in schools in September 2023.</p><p>The draft specification places a strong focus on the development of important life skills that young people need growing up in a fast changing and complex world. This consultation is open until the 18th of October and I would strongly encourage anyone who has yet to do so to make their contribution.</p><p>Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification has already commenced and a background paper was published last week for public consultation on the NCCA website. It is anticipated that the Senior Cycle draft specification itself will be available for public consultation by next summer, with a view to being implemented in schools in September 2024.</p><p>Following publication of the new Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Wellbeing in primary schools. This development group will work on the development of an SPHE specification for primary schools, to include RSE, with the aim of rolling it out in schools in September 2025.</p><p>These timelines remain in line with international norms in terms of curriculum development.  </p><p>In the interim, &ldquo;online toolkits&rdquo; have been developed.

In April last, I announced a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE/RSE.

The allocation model, which was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), is designed to distribute the total available number of Special Education Teachers across primary and post-primary schools based on the relative need of each school, as evidenced by a number of key indicators.</p>  <p>  The SET model is a fairer and more transparent way of allocating teaching resources to schools.</p>  <p>  The SET model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. </p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced, it was designed to be updated on a regular basis (most recent update was for 2022/2023 school year) so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.   </p>  <p>  Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  North Bay Educate Together National School may seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal, they should contact the NCSE at www.ncse.ie</p></reply>

Responsibility for these institutions falls under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p>  <p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. </p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with 53 research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie., a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>  <p>  The Department recognises  the importance of minimising water demand through measures to reduce water usage, such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc. To this end schools were invited in 2010 to apply for Water Conservation measures and funding of almost &euro;10m was made available to promote water conservation measures as part of this initiative.</p>  <p>  In our new school design we provide for water conservation in two key ways.</p>  <p>  The first approach is the substitution of mains potable water with rainwater for toilet flushing. There is good potential for recovering or harvesting rainwater in schools to use for flushing toilets and where feasible these systems are provided for in new school projects. All new schools and major extensions have a rainwater recovery system installed.</p>  <p>  The second step is the elimination of unnecessary water use, this is achieved a number of means. Water supply for ablution is provided through a single percussion (push) type spray taps. Engagement with schools highlighted that young children used only the cold water taps in schools for washing their hands as they were afraid of the hot tap, associating it with those in their homes which may lack anti-scald provision. Supplying a blended reduced temperature to the hot tap made no difference in their behavior. In response, the Department has adopted a single tap solution to all wash hand basins where the hot and cold water are mixed at the tap intake with anti-scald protection; thus all water outlets for ablution are single percussion taps giving a blended safe water supply.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above low water content dual flushing toilets are also installed and automatic urinal flushing devices are also installed in post primary schools (urinals are not installed in new primary schools for operation reasons).</p>  <p>  Drinking water outlets have for many years been provided in schools, all primary schools would typically have drinking water provision in each classroom and the external play areas and post primary schools would typically have drinking water distributed both in internal and external play areas.</p>  <p>  In line with Climate Action Policy on single use plastic, schools promote and encourage pupils to have their own reusable drinking bottle which they can top up as needed during the day, thus supporting water conservation and plastic reduction while not imposing additional operating costs on School Management. </p></reply>

We are determined to support the huge efforts we are seeing from our school communities across the country, who have shown huge commitment and generosity in meeting the needs of all Ukrainian children.  Of course, the Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine since the beginning of this war.  By end of September, figures show that over 11,000 children from Ukraine had enrolled in schools in every county across the State.  Approximately 7,400 children from Ukraine had enrolled in primary schools, while over 4,300 had enrolled in our post-primary schools.  With regard to the area of Fingal in particular, Ukrainian students who are living in the Fingal area of Dublin have so far been accommodated in local schools close to their accommodation.  I am advised that the local Regional Education and Language Team (REALT) co-ordinator has engaged with families in the area.  My Department carried out surveys at Primary and Post Primary level to identify potential capacity.  My Department has incorporated this information with other information in the Geographical Information System (GIS) system to enable quick identification of potential capacity through the Community Analyst reporting system.  This includes the Fingal area.  Our understanding is that there is sufficient capacity in the surrounding schools and neighbouring schools within a reasonable travel distance. The impact analysis from the GIS system sets out the available capacity as well as information on distance, school planning area, current school enrolment information, number of Ukrainian students enrolled etc.  Each REALT team has access to this tool.  This reflects their key role in assisting children in finding school places and in supporting schools in their area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge.  This reporting tool enables the REALT co-ordinator to quickly assess the impact of the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children on school capacity in a particular area.  They are then able to work to ensure that existing accommodation capacity within all local schools can be leveraged to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

Currently, Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle.  As set out in the Programme for Government, this Government is committed to developing inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools. </p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the development of updated curricula in this area, and to support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p><p>An immediate focus of the work of the NCCA was on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit, to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way.  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits are being expanded during 2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom.  </p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is underway. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification was published for consultation on 18 July, with the consultation process running until 18 October.  It is expected that the finalised Junior Cycle specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, and will be implemented in schools in September 2023. </p><p>In regard to Senior Cycle, a background paper that will inform the updating of Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE was published for public consultation on 3 October.  Feedback from this consultation will inform the work of the SPHE Development Group and it is intended that a draft updated curriculum for Senior Cycle SPHE will be ready for public consultation by next summer and finalised in early 2024, for implementation in schools in September 2024.  In regard to Primary Schools, following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Wellbeing in primary schools. This group will progress the development of an SPHE specification for primary schools, to include RSE, with the aim of rolling it out in schools in September 2025. </p><p>In addition to developing updated curricula and support materials the NCCA will contribute to facilitating interagency collaboration and linkages between the formal and non-formal education sector to enhance the sharing of expertise, learning and resources related to RSE.  The NCCA will also initiate networking between groups/agencies working to support schools on targeted initiatives, such as consent and LGBTQI+ issues.</p><p>Pending the introduction of these updated curricula, at primary level the Stay Safe Programme is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme while at post primary level, two programmes are in place which come under the heading of Personal Safety.  One of these programmes is for Junior Cycle which addresses personal safety in relationships and explores topics such as healthy and unhealthy relationships, consent and domestic gender-based and sexual violence.  The other programme, which is for Senior Cycle, addresses topics such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, dating violence and rape. Both of these programmes were designed by the Professional Development Support Service (PDST) and are intended to be taught as part of the wider SPHE/RSE curriculum.  Professional development support is available to teachers, directly linked to these resources.</p><p>The work underway in my Department is reflected in a number of key actions within <i>Zero Tolerance</i>, the third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV), which was published in June.  These actions reflect the vital role of the education sector in the development and implementation of this Strategy, through the updating of the SPHE/RSE curricula; the provision of training aimed at improving teacher confidence and competence in the areas of SPHE and RSE; and the promotion of environments free from gender-based violence within our schools, and ensuring that issues such as sexual harassment and identity bullying are considered as part of the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on Bullying and Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools.  My Department&rsquo;s actions within the Strategy reflect its role in realising the aim of eradicating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from society.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO. </p><p>I am pleased to advise that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is eligible under the terms of the scheme and a sanction has been sent by School Transport Section of my Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the establishment of a new service for the pupil to the school referred to by the Deputy.  </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann have tendered this service in line with procurement guidelines and are in the process of allocating a contractor to operate this service, once a contractor has been sourced, the service will commence.

Families of children who are eligible for these services may therefore apply for the Special Transport Grant, which is a once off payment, paid retrospectively to families once the School Transport service is in place and is to assist with the cost of private transport arrangements the family had put in place until services are finalised. Families should contact School Transport Section at: school_transport@education.gov.ie for more information on this grant.</p></reply>

At post-primary level some 74% of school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2029, with most expected to reach a peak within the next two or three years.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through: </p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>There are two Gaelscoileanna in the Killester_Raheny_Clontarf School Planning Area and the most recent demographic projections indicate a slight reduction in enrolments at primary level in this School Planning Area (SPA). </p><p>As part of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, my Department has committed to creating opportunities for expanding Irish-medium education outside the Gaeltacht in the context of the announcements since April 2018 on the establishment of 47 new schools from 2019, which affords particular consideration to the establishment of Gaelscoileanna, Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, and Aonaid L&aacute;n-Ghaeilge as part of the patronage process for new schools. Of these 47 new schools, one new primary school to serve the Killester/Raheny/Clontarf school planning area was announced.</p><p>This school was established in 2019 under the patronage of Educate Together following a patronage process which gave an opportunity for parents to express a preference for Irish-medium.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists, but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>  <p>  In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers, the school continues to have access to NEPS for critical incident support, for regional support and development service and also to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries, through the local NEPS office.  In relation to a casework service, the school may access a casework service, where there is need, via psychologists on the SCPA panel. The local NEPS office is available to discuss any other requirements the school may have.</p></reply>

As you are likely aware, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a school-based psychological service to all recognised primary and post-primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, and the academic, social and emotional development of all learners.  </p><p>The NEPS service provides access for all schools to:</p><p>- Psychological support in the event of a Critical Incident</p><p>- A Casework Service for individual children where there is a need for intensive consultation and assessment </p><p>- A school staff Support and Development Service, to build school capability to provide a comprehensive continuum of support in schools<i>and</i></p><p>- Ongoing access to advice and support for schools.</p><p>This overall approach allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent individual cases and, through supporting school staff, to benefit many more children than could be seen individually.</p><p>In 2021 the NEPS casework service extended to over 8,500 students.  Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students.  Furthermore, the NEPS Support and Development service reaches an estimated 25,000 teachers annually.</p><p>There is currently in the region of 225 whole-time equivalent NEPS educational psychologists delivering an excellent service to our schools, having grown from a base of 173 posts in 2014. NEPS was allocated a budget of approximately &euro;24 million in 2022 to deliver its essential service.  As part of Budget 2023, I recently announced provision for an additional 54 educational psychologists to strengthen the NEPS service overall, and in particular to provide strengthened services for special schools and special classes.</p><p>My Department is acutely aware of recruitment challenges which exist nationally in terms of educational psychologists, and has established a high-level working group, chaired by the Secretary General, to consider how best to support educational psychologists and to ensure that there is an adequate supply of psychologists available to the education sector.  I am very conscious of the issue of fees for trainee education psychologists and am working intensively with my officials to find a positive resolution to the issue.</p></reply>

This project is currently at the planning stage.</p>  <p>  Further correspondence has been received recently from the school requesting the provision of additional accommodation to facilitate the current intake of Ukrainian pupils.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that in particular the Donegal area is accommodating a significant number of Ukrainians which has put pressure on surrounding schools to accommodate pupils.</p>  <p>  Utilisation of each school&rsquo;s existing capacity in the most flexible way possible is key to supporting Ukrainian children who are being enrolled in our schools.</p>  <p>  It is very important for existing capacity in a town or area to be fully utilised before looking at additional accommodation requirements either via off-site or modular accommodation solutions.  This requires good cooperation and collaboration between schools supported as necessary through the local Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT) whose primary role is to assist children in finding school places and to support schools to meet the needs of these children as they emerge.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the local REALT co-ordinator has been in contact with the school in relation to its accommodation needs.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s assessment of any request for additional accommodation will include consideration of whether capacity across all other schools in the town or area is fully utilised.  The request from the school referred to is currently being assessed and my Department will be in communication with the school in this respect shortly.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Under the SNA allocation model for special classes and special schools there is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio. An ASD special class, for example, has an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. This ratio applies to the special class, not the entire school.</p><p>Additional SNA support over the prescribed ratio may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school.</p><p>The school in question is not a special school and does not have any special classes so a ratio applicable to such schools and classes would not apply.</p><p>In relation to SNA support the NCSE has confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs. The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year, and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations</p><p>The school can apply to the NCSE for a review of its SNA allocation if it is insufficient to meet the needs of its students. Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>The allocation allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SET allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p><p>The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education. Parents who have concerns regarding the manner in which the resources or supports which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school should, in the first instance, raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>I hope this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.</p>  <p>  An investment programme of &euro;210m has been delivered to schools under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 &ndash;2020.  Additionally, the first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy for schools to 2027, ICT grant funding of &euro;50m has also been issued to schools. Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. The grant funding allocation issues directly to schools and can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school.  </p>  <p>  Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  Based on the professional information provided to the SENO when the application was first received in June 2022, and in line with criteria set out in Circular 10/2013, they were not in a position to recommend an assistive technology grant for the school concerned on behalf of this student. However following receipt of the necessary documentation, I can confirm that the appeal for assistive technology for the pupil named by the deputy has been approved by my Department and a sanction has issued to the school concerned recently.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>  <p>In relation to the pupil to which the Deputy refers, a referral for NEPS involvement was received on 19 September from the pupil's school, and this referral will be progressed in the short term by the assigned psychologist. </p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>We have seen 392 new special classes being sanctioned by the NCSE for this school year , bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, budget funding provides for a further 370 special classes to open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023. </p><p>My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. This work involves a detailed review of statistical data in relation to forecasting demand for special class places, consideration of improved data sharing arrangements and a particular focus on the provision of special classes at post-primary level.</p><p>At local level, the NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024.

All equipment provided under this scheme supports children with more complex disabilities who require essential specialist equipment in order to access the school curriculum.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2 million funding has been secured in Budget 2023 for this scheme. This represents an increase of almost 60% on funding allocated previously to this essential support.</p>  <p>  Assistive technology is a critical enabler for those with special educational needs to gain the maximum benefit from a modern technologically focused education system and this increased allocation shows the Departments continued commitment to ensuring that a full range of resources, not just teachers and SNAs, are available to support children who most need it.</p>  <p>  3766 students have benefited from this scheme in 2021. A review of this scheme has initiated to ensure that it is working for these children and that the resources are allocated appropriately and as efficiently as possible.  The review in ongoing and is expected to complete by mid-2023. This process will have a consultative element and relevant stakeholders will be invited to participate. </p>  <p>  Last April, my Department announced the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 and associated grant funding for all recognised primary and post-primary schools for digital technology infrastructure.</p>  <p>  This strategy will advance the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment, building on the work under previous strategies. It aims to further support the school system so that all students across our schools have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to navigate an ever-evolving digital world successfully.</p>  <p>  As part of this strategy an ICT Grant will be provided to schools, with &euro;200 million committed over the period of the Strategy, &euro;50m of which has already been provided to schools. This approach facilitates multi-annual planning by schools to allow them to plan effectively for all of their children.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.</p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>   Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>   In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann organises for vehicles to be full to capacity with tickets based on applications received and based on the seating capacity of the vehicle.   It is not feasible to issue additional tickets over and above the seating capacity of the vehicle which could result in a potential overload situation arising and all pupils not being carried on the service.</p>  <p>  It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is a late applicant and the application is currently being assessed.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level. The NCSE has advised my Department that there are sufficient special class places available at primary and post-primary for the start of this school year 2022/2023. </p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p>  <p>  In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p>  <p>  For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p>  <p>  My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level. 100 of these new classes are being provided in the Dublin region. The NCSE advise my Department that there are sufficient primary and post-primary special class places available at the start of this school year 2022/2023.</p>  <p>  For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023. My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023/2024.

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is eligible under the terms of the scheme and a sanction has been sent by School Transport Section of my Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the establishment of a new service for the pupil to the school referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have tendered this service in line with procurement guidelines and are in the process of allocating a contractor to operate this service, once a contractor has been sourced, the service will commence.  Bus &Eacute;ireann will liaise with the family directly with regard to this matter at that stage.</p>  <p>  Both the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the challenges faced by parents awaiting transport for students with special educational needs. Families of children who are eligible for these services may therefore apply for the Special Transport Grant, which is a once off payment, paid retrospectively to families once the School Transport service is in place and is to assist with the cost of private transport arrangements the family had put in place until services are finalised. Families should contact School Transport Section at: school_transport@education.gov.ie for more information on how to apply for this grant.</p></reply>

This code of behaviour is prepared in consultation with the principal, teaching staff and the parents of students registered in the school. The code is required to consider the needs of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Recognising that expulsion of a student is a serious decision it can only be made by the schools board of management.  The board must, before expelling a student, notify the Educational Welfare Officer (EWO), in writing and outline the reasons for the proposed expulsion.  The board of management cannot confirm the expulsion until the passing of 20 school days from the date the EWO receives such notice.  This 20 day period allows the EWO to convene a meeting under Section 24 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 of all the relevant educational partners involved with the case including behavioural analysts if appropriate, to see if an alternative option other than expulsion can be reached.</p>  <p>  Under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 an appeals process is available to a parent/guardian following expulsion of their child.  An independent appeals committee is appointed to consider all such appeals.  In circumstances where the appeals committee decision is to allow such appeals the school is directed to readmit the student.</p>  <p>  Additional supports are also provided by my Department and other agencies to assist schools in managing pupil behaviours.

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already over 125,000 tickets have issued for the 2022/2023 school year. At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, which is over 20% of an increase.  There has been an increase of over 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of over 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by 29 April and registered for a ticket by 29 July.</p>  <p>  It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  The School Transport Scheme is a demand led scheme, as numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year, while it is not possible to provide specific information until all applications have been processed, so far, 5,529 tickets have issued to students in Limerick for the 2022/2023 school year, this is an increase of over 25% on the number of tickets issued in the 2021/2022 school year.  This number may change as Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process a small number of remaining on time applications.  Where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware the schools broadband programme operates subject to procurement regulations through a publicly procured Framework of Providers of Broadband Services. The Framework of Providers of Broadband and Associated Services for Primary schools was recently renewed, and it is open to all providers to apply for that Framework. The programme operates on the basis of mini-competitions from that Framework, per procurement obligations, and the service being provided to the  school is the best available through that Framework.   I understand a previous attempt to connect this school to the fibre infrastructure unearthed civil works issues to the school that required intervention, and the service provider could not connect the school to the fibre network as a consequence.</p>  <p>  As previously stated, my department is committed to providing all primary schools with high speed broadband in 2023 through the National Broadband Plan, commercial provision, and the NRRP project. The school referred is included in the next tender for services under this high speed broadband programme which is due to issue shortly, with high speed connectivity to be provided early in 2023.

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p>  <p>  Children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>Temporary Alleviation Measures is a measure pending completion of the review of the School Transport Scheme, which was initially introduced at post-primary level in 2019 and will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by 29 April and registered for a ticket by 29 July.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

This was my third successive Budget which saw an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools. Budget 2021 reduced the staffing schedule to an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils, while Budget 2022 reduced it further to 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils.  A three point reduction in the retention schedule, in place since 2021, assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.  There is no change to the pupil teacher ratio at post-primary level.  Teachers are allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the Free Education System and 23:1 to schools in the fee-charging sector.</p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.7:1 to 13.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2016/17 school year to the 2021/22 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 27:1 to 25:1.  Average class sizes improved from 24.6 to 22.8 in the same period.  The budget measures will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published at the end of the school year.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour. </p><p>The procedures recognise that a positive school culture and climate is key and set out a very practical way on what schools must do to both prevent bullying and to deal with bullying when it occurs.In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the school's complaints procedures.</p><p>All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures. A template policy is provided in the procedures to help facilitate schools in this regard.</p><p>The Board of Management must ensure that the school has clear procedures for the formal noting and reporting of bullying behaviour, and these must be documented in the schools&rsquo; anti-bullying policy.The procedures for schools include important oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying in February of this year. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. </p><p>The review is taking account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It is specifically considering cyber bullying, identity based bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. </p><p>The review is also giving detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021. </p><p>The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland and two anti-racism advocates. The Steering Committee has held ten meetings to date.</p><p>A number of consultation strands have been conducted over the past few months including focus groups with children and young people, focus groups with school staff and members of the school community and a public consultation process. This extensive consultation process will ensure that my Department captures as many voices as possible to inform the development of an inclusive and comprehensive Action Plan on Bullying.</p><p>A Working Group has been established to review and update the <i>Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools</i>in parallel with this work. The working group is comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU.</p></reply>

This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p><p>The most recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that over 90% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level show decreasing enrolments for the period to 2025 compared with 2021, whereas some 88% of school planning areas at post-primary level are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2028, with most expected to reach a peak in the next two or three years. </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through: </p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a  school or schools,</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>The requirement for additional school places in North Kildare school planning areas is kept under on-going review.  Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with the local Council in respect of its review of the Development Plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements and in this regard will be making a submission to the draft Co.

As outlined in the mission statement, my Department will facilitate children and young people, through learning, to achieve their full potential and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s social, economic and cultural development. The primary mechanism to deliver this is through the curriculum, providing a sound basis of appropriate inputs, enabling learners to progress through the continuum of education to further and higher education, and the word of work.</p><p>In that context, my Department is represented on the Cross Departmental Project Team (CDPT) which is being led by the OECD who are reviewing the National Skills Strategy 2016-2025, in order to draft an updated Skills Strategy for Ireland. </p><p>My Department also has policy initiatives in place addressing particular areas which may be of relevance to the question. The <i>Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027</i>with the aim of empowering schools to further embed digital technologies across their teaching, learning and assessment.  It sets out how the development of digital skills is supported in schools and builds on the key achievements under the previous strategy. The STEM Education Policy Statement recognises the importance of initiatives that raise awareness and interest in STEM among the public in Ireland to enable them to engage in informed STEM discussions. It also recognises the need to improve STEM education. Development of the next STEM Education Policy Implementation Plan (delayed due to Covid19) is underway with a public consultation and focus group consultations completed to date. </p><p>Post-primary education in Ireland consists of a  three year junior cycle, followed by a two or three year senior cycle, depending on whether the optional transition year is taken.</p><p>At Junior Cycle, the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 provides the basis for post-primary schools to plan quality, inclusive and relevant education programmes with improved learning experiences for all students, including those with special educational needs.</p><p>The Senior Cycle includes an optional transition year (TY) which follows immediately after the Junior Cycle. TY provides an opportunity for students to experience a wide range of educational inputs, including work experience, over the course of a year that is free from formal examinations. </p><p>During the final two years of Senior Cycle, students take one of three programmes, each leading to a state examination, the Leaving Certificate Established, the Leaving Certificate Vocational  programme or the Leaving Certificate Applied.</p><p>The Leaving Certificate Established is a two-year programme that aims to provide learners with a broad, balanced education while also offering some specialisation towards a particular career option. Subjects are assessed by an examination paper and by additional assessment methods including oral and aural examinations, practical examinations and assessment of practical coursework at the end of the two-year programme of study. Performance in the examination can be used for purposes of selection into employment, and into further and higher education. </p><p>The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme is a two-year programme that combines the academic strengths of the Leaving Certificate with a dynamic focus on self-directed learning, enterprise, work and the community.  </p><p>The Leaving Certificate Applied is a two-year Leaving Certificate, available to students who wish to follow a practical or vocationally orientated programme. The Leaving Certificate Applied is made up of a range of courses that are structured around three elements: Vocational Preparation, Vocational Education and General Education. </p><p>I have announced an ambitious programme to redevelop Senior Cycle which includes:</p><p>-  expanding access to Transition Year so that all students who wish to can avail of the opportunity it presents; </p><p>-  integrating the current three Leaving Certificate programmes over time to ensure students can access the different strengths of the current programmes and to ensure all students can have access to the maximum number of pathways beyond school in terms of accessing work, apprenticeships or further study;</p><p>-  introducing two new subjects from September 2024 which reflect the variety of interest amongst students and changing employment prospects for students as they progress from school and study; and</p><p>-  significantly changing the way learning is assessed so that there is a greater balance between the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.</p><p>The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.</p><p>The numbers employed in our schools have now reached their highest ever level.  The number of teachers has increased from 63,635 in 2016/17 to 72,496 in 2021/22, an increase of over 8,800 teaching posts, which includes the allocation for special education provision.</p><p>In Budget 2023, I ensured major investment in our schools and I have succeeded in bringing the teacher allocation ratio to an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 23 pupils in all primary schools for the 2023/24 school year which is the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This was my third successive Budget which saw an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools.</p><p>In Budget 2021, I also introduced a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. The recent announcement in Budget 2023 will further reduce this retention schedule, by virtue of the one point improvement to the staffing schedule which helps to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher. </p><p>My Department runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of both primary and post-primary teachers.</p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools. </p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <b><i>Sub Seeker</i></b>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>Newly qualified teachers (NQTs) will also represent a new source of supply in 2022/23. In excess of 3,400 primary and post-primary NQTs have had their registrations finalised by the Teaching Council to date with almost 40 further applications currently in progress.</p><p>The Teaching Council recently made regulations allowing for the registration of 3rd and 4th year undergraduate ITE students under a new registration route, Route 5 (Student Teachers).To date, in excess of 1,200 student teachers have registered with the Teaching Council with a further 70 applications still being processed.  Once registered with the Council, such student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitutable vacancies.</p><p>Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) who provide programmes for initial teacher education (ITE), put in place new ITE undergraduate programmes since 2019 in a number of post-primary priority subject areas, including Irish, mathematics, computer science and modern foreign languages.</p><p>In February 2019, my Department launched a scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers in priority subjects. The aim of the circular is to provide a way for schools to recruit teachers in the high demand subjects while also facilitating new teachers with a full time contract.</p><p>Turasabhaile is a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals which matches registered teachers&rsquo; resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools in Ireland.</p><p>The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term teaching positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p><p>The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the <b><i>Teaching Transforms</i></b>campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms.</p><p>My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to address challenges faced by schools and to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

Small schools are highly valued in their communities in that they provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activity.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment contained in the Programme for Government to continue to recognise the importance of small schools. There is a further commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents. The decision making authority for a school closure belongs to the Patron of a school. Any proposal to close a school must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders, parents, teachers, students and local communities and follow decisions taken at local level. Proposals must be agreed with the Department.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools. This measure saw a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020. This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher. This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from further improvements to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in recent years and the staffing schedule at primary level will now reduce to 23 pupils to 1 teacher from September 2023, which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools as well as primary schools on our islands.  The staffing process also contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific one aimed at small schools, to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in July 2021, my Department launched a two-year action research project aimed at supporting small rural schools. This project officially commenced in January 2022. The purpose of the project is to inform the development of a policy of supports for small schools through working with education partners to trial innovative approaches to support and sustain small schools in a number of clusters. Six project clusters of small schools have been formed, two in Galway, and one each in Donegal, Kerry, Wicklow and Waterford, consisting of 3/4/5 schools per cluster. </p></reply>

This position is set out in Departmental Circular 13/2016, published in February 2016, which states that schools should avoid using resources developed by the alcohol industry. This message is also reiterated in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s <i>SPHE Guidelines for Teachers</i>. My Department is giving active consideration to how best to ensure that this position is reflected across our schools. In that regard, my Department will continue to liaise with the HSE, in the context of ongoing work with both the HSE and the Department of Health and HSE on the cross- Government Healthy Ireland programme, the national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the people in Ireland. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the issue of alcohol misuse is addressed in the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. As students progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues, including substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling. SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in Junior Cycle, where it forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p><p>In addition to the above, the 'Know the Score' programme is a substance misuse programme published in 2019 for Transition Year or 5th year pupils. The content is based on research about effective approaches to the prevention of substance misuse. It was jointly developed by the HSE, my Department and the Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces. Students and teachers were involved in the design of the 14 lessons and supporting digital content, which aim to facilitate informed discussions about alcohol and drugs in the classroom.</p><p>As the deputy will be aware, the SPHE curriculum is in a process of redevelopment at all stages. Details on the process and consultations related to this curriculum redevelopment are available on NCCA.ie, and I would note that the draft specification for Junior Cycle, and the background paper for Senior Cycle, are currently open for consultation.</p></reply>

The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way.</p><p>In tandem, work on the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum across Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle is progressing.  </p><p>A draft revised Junior Cycle specification was published for consultation on 18 July, with the consultation process running until 18 October. The consultation will take feedback from teachers and students as well as other interested groups and individuals. More information on the consultation process, including how to contribute to it, is available on the NCCA&rsquo;s website. It is expected that the finalised Junior Cycle specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, and will be implemented in schools in September 2023.</p><p>The draft updated specification provides clear direction on the knowledge and skills that all students should gain during the three years of Junior Cycle SPHE. It places a strong focus on the development of important life skills that young people need growing up in a fast changing and complex world. For example, the draft specification addresses the issue of alcohol and addiction in <i>Strand 2: Making healthy choices.</i>The learning outcomes of this strand includes investigating how unhealthy products are marketed and advertised to appeal to young people; analysing the supports and challenges for young people when it comes to healthy choices about addictive substances and overcoming them; and discussing the physical, social, and legal consequences of their own or others&rsquo; use of addictive substances.</p><p>In relation to Senior Cycle, preparation to update the SPHE/RSE specification has commenced and a background paper was published earlier this month for public consultation on the NCCA website. It is anticipated that the Senior Cycle draft specification itself will be available for public consultation by next summer, with a view to being implemented in schools in September 2024.</p><p>Following publication of the new Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Wellbeing in primary schools. </p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  I know what a hugely important service school transport is for families and children. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022/2023 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already over 125,000 tickets have issued for the 2022/2023 school year. At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, which is over 20% of an increase.  There has been an increase of over 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of over 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July.</p>  <p>  It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.   Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. </p>  <p>  The School Transport Scheme is a demand led scheme, as numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year, it is not possible to provide specific information until all applications have been processed.  Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process a small number of remaining on time applications, where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

There are 31 victims of domestic violence currently being supported under the Protocol, with a further 29 victims of domestic violence being supported on rent supplement subject to the standard rent supplement means assessment and eligibility criteria, following a period of support under the domestic violence protocol.</p><p>Table 1 shows the number accessing rent supplement support under the domestic violence protocol from August 2020 to date in 2022.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; The number accessing rent supplement support under domestic violence protocol at end of month, to date in 2022.</b></p><p><b>Recipients of Rent Supplement under Domestic Violence Protocol</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th><div>2020</div></th>       <th><div>2021</div></th>       <th><div>2022</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>47</div></td>       <td><div>49</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>53</div></td>       <td><div>46</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>55</div></td>       <td><div>45</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>68</div></td>       <td><div>48</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>73</div></td>       <td><div>43</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>56</div></td>       <td><div>38 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div>52</div></td>       <td><div> 32</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td><div>1</div></td>       <td><div>50</div></td>       <td><div> 29</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td><div>14</div></td>       <td><div>54</div></td>       <td><div> 31</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td><div>22</div></td>       <td><div>47</div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td><div>32</div></td>       <td><div>47</div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December</td>       <td><div>41</div></td>       <td><div>46</div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the means test, at application stage and through the lifetime of a claim, an applicant must provide full and up to date details of any income(s), asset(s), savings and investment(s) held and inform the Department of any relevant changes in their circumstances that may affect their pension entitlement.  </p>  <p>  On 27 April 2022, a means review questionnaire issued to the person concerned. The completed questionnaire was returned, together with supporting financial documentation.  On examining the details provided, the Deciding Officer determined that the person's means had increased since the previous assessment and made a revised decision, reducing their weekly entitlement.  The person concerned was notified of the decision on 20 May 2022 and provided with details of the revised means assessment.  The person was also informed of their right, if dissatisfied with the decision, to request a review, or to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. There is no record of an appeal having been lodged.    </p>  <p>  On foot of further communication from the person concerned, the Deciding Officer issued a letter of clarification about the payment reduction on 16 June 2022. </p>  <p>  A further reply issued on 4 October 2022 to follow on correspondence received from the person concerned.  The Deciding Officer has again reviewed the person&rsquo;s entitlement and they have been notified that their pension entitlement, at the reduced rate remains unchanged.

The person did not provide a full disclosure of his means despite multiple requests made by officials in my Department.  The JA claim was subsequently disallowed with effect from 17/08/2022 as the person had not shown that his means were less than the weekly rate of JA appropriate to his family circumstances.  A Deciding Officer advised the person of their decision in a letter dated 19/08/2022.</p>  <p>  The person concerned subsequently appealed the decision of the Deciding Officer on his JA claim to the SWAO.  The SWAO functions independently of my Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. The SWAO has advised that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 26/09/2022.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  The Deciding Officer sent a submission to the SWAO on 10/10/2022.  The case will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if necessary, hold an oral appeal hearing.</p>  <p>  While awaiting a determination from the SWAO, the first person concerned applied for a basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).  A basic SWA is a weekly means assessed allowance paid to people who do not have enough income to meet their needs and those of their families.  It may be awarded where a person is awaiting the outcome of an appeal to disallow a primary scheme payment.</p>  <p>  Further information in support of the person&rsquo;s basic SWA application was sought by an official during a phone conversation with the person on 26/08/2022.  When this information was not received a follow up request issued by a letter on 30/09/2022.  As this information has not yet been provided the claim cannot be progressed.  As soon as the person concerned provides the required information, his application will be finalised and he will be notified of the outcome. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Entitlement to the payment is based on social insurance contributions paid by the woman or her husband as well as a number of other qualifying criteria.  The Deserted Wife's Benefit scheme was closed off to new applications with effect from 2 January 1997, when One-Parent Family Payment was introduced.</p><p>Some women have continued to receive Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit because they qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have continued to meet the qualifying criteria. </p><p>No earnings limit applies to claims made before 30 August 1992.  An earnings limit of &euro;12,697.38 was introduced on 31 August 1992 with a reduced rate payable provided earnings did not exceed &euro;17,776.33.  From 3 May 2007 the earning limit was increased to &euro;20,000.  </p><p>There are no plans to change the qualification conditions for the scheme at present.  Where a woman no longer meets these conditions but has an income need she may qualify for another payment from my Department.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It supports projects that provide work experience for long term unemployed persons. The programme is delivered through CE sponsor organisations in the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  CE sponsor organisations receive annual contracts from my department, which funds the employment of both CE participants and CE supervisors.  Funding is also provided towards training and material costs.  </p>  <p>  The materials grant is not a set amount for all CE schemes, as the rate is determined by individual scheme costs and participant numbers. The materials grant is a contribution towards the running costs of CE schemes and covers consumable services and materials necessary for the effective operation of the CE project including such items as employers and public liability insurance, tools, stationery, audit fees, bank charges (excluding bank interest), protective clothing and the hiring of equipment.   </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the expenditure on materials grants will be of the order of &euro;12.3 million this year.

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods (of up to 20 years) outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment. </p>  <p>  I announced a series of landmark reforms to the State Pension system on 20th September 2022.  The measures, which were approved by Cabinet, are in response to the recommendations from the Commission on Pensions.  The set of measures represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State Pension system. </p>  <p>  One of the reforms for which I secured Government agreement is enhanced State Pension provision for long-term carers (who have been caring in excess of 20 years), as recommended by the Pensions Commission, and to be introduced from January 2024.  This will be implemented through:</p>  <p>  -  A scheme to ensure that long-term carers can be attributed with contributions for gaps in their contribution record arising from their time spent caring; and</p>  <p>  -  The establishment of a &lsquo;Family Carer Register'.</p>  <p>  My officials are working to implement the reforms, including the drafting of legislation and development of administrative and IT systems as necessary.  As part of the work to implement the new scheme, relevant Government Departments, and other stakeholders, will examine options for the creation of a statutory &lsquo;Family Carer Register&rsquo; to help identify long-term carers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department intends, where possible, to continue to offer its many customers the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT).  </p><p>For some social welfare schemes, it can be mandatory for a payment to be collected in cash at a post office.  For example, some social welfare scheme rules require a customer to prove that they are resident in the state and are available for work.  These payment method restrictions are limited and, in most cases, a customer can choose the payment method most convenient for them.</p><p>Cash welfare payments are governed by the Department&rsquo;s Cash Payment Services Contract with An Post which was signed in December 2019 and came into effect in January 2020.  This contract ran for two years, from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021.  After the two year contract period was completed, the Department had the option to renew the contract for a further year, which was executed.</p><p>The Cash Payment Services contract allows for 4 such annual renewals, i.e. to 31 December 2025.  Given the consistently high level of service delivered by the company, it is my intention that this contract be renewed again with An Post for 2023.</p><p>The annual agency fees paid to An Post from 2017 to date (under the terms of the current and of the previous Cash Payment Services contracts) are set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Agency Fee Paid</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;51,565,680.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;50,806,680.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;49,760,632.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020*</td>       <td>&euro;51,826,256.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021**</td>       <td>&euro;49,506,400.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Agency fees are paid in advance to An Post in monthly instalments with a final reconciliation carried out in the following year.  The 2020 agency fee was &euro;47,965,624.00 based on the level of transactions carried out by An Post that year.  However, the company was also owed an outstanding balance carried forward of &euro;3,860,632.00 which resulted in a final pay over of &euro;51,826,256.00.</p><p>**The 2021 fee figure is provisional pending the final sign-off on the 2021 figures by both the Department and the company.  This formal sign-off is expected to be carried out shortly.</p><p>The fees are calculated on a transaction basis as set out in the publicly tendered contract.  The transaction fees are set out in three bands.  The first band fee relates to the first 10 million payments cashed by An Post, the second band relates to the next 10 million transactions cashed by An Post and the third band relates to each subsequent payment cashed.  The actual transaction fees set out in each of the three bands cannot be released due to the commercial nature of the contract and to comply with both national and EU procurement rules.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property - other than the family home - and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced significant improvements to the means test for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society.  </p>  <p>  The general weekly income disregard for Carer's Allowance increased from June 2022 from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.  This will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.</p>  <p>  The capital disregard was also increased in June from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible for my Department to provide an estimate of the cost of the measure outlined by the Deputy.  The additional cost to the scheme will depend on a number of factors including if it was intended to award Fuel Allowance to all persons aged over 80 years, irrespective of whether Fuel Allowance is already in payment in a household or that the person aged over 80 years is resident in a dwelling such as a nursing home where their heating needs are provided for.</p>  <p>  Any estimate will also need to take account of the significant expansion of the Fuel Allowance scheme which I announced in Budget 2023 and in particular those measures extending the Fuel Allowance to the over 70s. It is estimated these measures combined will bring an additional 81,000 households into the Fuel Allowance Scheme from January with a significant proportion of these additional household belonging to persons aged 80 or over.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, I was pleased to announce the largest ever expansion of the Fuel Allowance Scheme. As part of this, from January 2023, a new means test will be introduced for over 70s. Under the new means test, a single person over 70 will be able to have income of &euro;500 per week and a couple will be able to have income of &euro;1,000 per week and still qualify for Fuel Allowance</p>  <p>  Also, from January 2023, the standard means test for persons under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 from &euro;120 to &euro;200 over the maximum rate of State Pension Contributory. In addition, the Disablement Benefit and the half-rate Carer's Allowance payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.</p>  <p>  It is estimated these measures combined will bring up to 81,000 households into the Fuel Allowance Scheme. My Department is already working on developing the IT and administrative systems to give effect to these changes. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A notice of appeal made after the 21-day period may be accepted with the approval of the Chief Appeals Officer.</p>  <p>  The notice of appeal must contain a statement of the facts and contentions upon which the person concerned intends to rely.

The programme is delivered through independent CE sponsoring organisations that operate in the community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities receive annual contracts from my Department which fund the employment of both CE participants and supervisors, as well as funding towards training and material costs. Grant aid is provided by the Department to cover these costs on a per capita basis.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a means tested payment to assist householders on long-term social welfare payments who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Fuel Allowance, currently &euro;33 per week, is paid from the end of September to April each year for 28 weeks.  CE participants with an underlying entitlement to the allowance continue to receive it as part of their weekly payments, made by CE sponsors to participants.  </p>  <p>  These payment arrangements which are in place between my department and CE sponsoring organisations do not support the payment of the Fuel Allowance in an up-front lump sum to CE participants.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;505 million package aimed at mitigating the effects of rising energy costs an additional one-off payment of &euro;125 was paid in early March to those in receipt of a Fuel Allowance, including CE participants. Under Budget 2023 a lump sum Fuel Allowance payment of &euro;400 will issue in November 2022.  This payment should assist those persons who pay for their fuel/heating needs by lump sum. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that it has been possible to make these two recently agreed payments by lump sum as they are standard amounts payable to all who qualify and do not involve calculation of a weekly entitlement covering an extended entitlement period to be aggregated and paid by lump sum. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Parental Leave allows parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children, such as in situations where a parent needs to take time off work because their child is required to isolate or stay at home due to Covid-19.  A person can take up to 26 weeks&rsquo; parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. Normally a person is required to give their employer 6 weeks&rsquo; notice if they want to take Parental leave, but employers can be asked to waive this notice period.</p><p>Parents can also avail of their entitlement to Parent's Leave. Parent&rsquo;s leave entitles each parent to 7 weeks&rsquo; leave during the first 2 years of a child&rsquo;s life, or in the case of adoption, within 2 years of the placement of the child with the family.  Parent&rsquo;s Benefit of &euro;250 per week is paid to eligible parents who satisfy certain PRSI conditions while on Parent&rsquo;s Leave.  As with Parental Leave, employers can be asked to waive the six-weeks' notice period required for Parent's Leave.</p><p>A person can also apply for <i>force majeure</i>leave, which is leave with pay for urgent family reasons owing to the injury or illness of an immediate relative. </p><p>On 21 April the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. The Bill was approved on 20 September 2022 and will be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas tomorrow. The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to transpose elements of the EU Work Life Balance Directive and provide new rights to parents and carers in order to support a better work life balance.</p><p>Under the proposed legislation, parents and carers will see a right to request flexible working in line with Article 9 of the Directive and relative to this question, the introduction of five days leave per year for medical care purposes in line with Article 6 of the Directive. The Bill will also extend the current entitlement to breastfeeding/lactation breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts from six months to two years. The proposals will complement family leave and other entitlements already in place and provide additional flexibility to ensure that parents and carers can be supported to balance their working and family lives. </p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007.</p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD. As the Deputy will be aware, the Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a commitment in the Programme for Government, to follow the State's first periodic review before the UN Committee.</p>  <p>  Due to delays at UN level, Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the Committee will now be delayed. In light of this, I have indicated that I am open to earlier ratification, independent of the timelines involved in the review of the State Report.</p>  <p>  Ratification, when it occurs, will be contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is reflective of the State&rsquo;s long-standing approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith, and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to determine in full the requirements for ratification to occur at the earliest possible date. One key action required for ratification is the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. This Act is a key requirement for compliance with a number of measures related to the UNCRPD. Amending legislation is required to commence the Act in full and this is before the Houses at the moment. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has cleared all D&aacute;il Stages and completed Committee Stage in the Seanad on 6 October.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 51,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 40,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted.</p>  <p>  The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response. Given arrival numbers, sourcing suitable accommodation continues to remain a challenge. Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues. </p>  <p>  I would like to apologise to the Deputy for any oversight in responding to his previous representations. Over 50,000 people have arrived from Ukraine as beneficiaries of temporary protection. It is not always possible to accommodate individuals in the part of the country where they might like to live. However, as far as possible, the Department works with local authorities and its NGO implementing partners-  particularly the Irish Red Cross and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) - who aim to match beneficiaries to pledged accommodation where it is available.</p>  <p>  Beneficiaries of temporary protection are entitled to make their own private arrangements including potentially availing of pledged accommodation if they wish, and can avail of some supports to do so. To date, 4,398 Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection have been placed in 1,718 properties and this number continues to increase weekly. Those wishing to avail of pledged accommodation can contact the local authority in the appropriate area . </p>  <p>  The Government is resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine, and huge efforts are being made to source facilities that will provide those arriving in Ireland with safety and shelter. </p>  <p>  More information on supports available to Ukrainian people while they are in Ireland and information on how people and community groups can help can be found at the Government website: www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/bc537-irelands-response-to-the-situation-in-ukraine/.</p></reply>

Since 1999, Ireland has undertaken investigations into allegations of abuse in various institutional settings. These investigations have sought to establish the facts relating to the operation of the institutions, as well as the manner in which those who were resident in them were treated. </p><p>In establishing the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in February 2015, the then Government sought to ensure an independent and thorough investigation of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998. Notably, the Commission was specifically tasked with investigating concerns related to systematic discrimination within these institutions.</p><p>Following publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, An Taoiseach offered a formal apology on behalf of the Government, the State and its citizens to all those who spent time in these institutions. In this apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failings of the State, over many decades, to protect vulnerable citizens, and to uphold their fundamental rights. The State apology recognised the <i>&ldquo;additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage, those who faced mental health challenges, or those with physical and intellectual disabilities&rdquo;.</i></p><p>It was further acknowledged that <i>&ldquo;such discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families&rdquo;.</i></p><p>This State apology marked a starting point for further measures designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families.</p><p>I am acutely aware that there is no financial payment which could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been affected by these issues.</p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is just one aspect of the overall package of supports and measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions</i>which seeks to provide an inclusive and enduring response to the priority needs of all survivors. </p><p>The proposed structure of the Scheme, with increasing financial payments depending on length of stay, recognises that higher payments should be made to those who were subjected to institutional conditions for a prolonged period.</p><p>This allows for a simple and non-adversarial application process, in which applicants will not have to prove abuse and the State can shoulder much of the administrative burden. </p><p>My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible.</p></reply>

I received the Committee's report on the 12th July and I am very grateful to the members for giving the draft legislation their careful attention. The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations have been carefully considered in the course of drafting the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed to provide payments and an Enhanced Medical Card to people who spent time in one or more of the 14 Mother and Baby Institutions or 29 County Home Institutions which were identified by the Commission of Investigation as having a main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante and post-natal facilities to unmarried mothers and their children. </p>  <p>  The decision not to include other institutions or care settings in the Scheme is not intended to disregard or diminish any person&rsquo;s experience and Government recognises that there are people who suffered stigma, trauma and abuse in other institutions, and outside of institutions, who will not qualify for this Scheme.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for the Minister to include additional institutions. If it were to come to light that an institution fulfilled a similar function with regard to unmarried mothers and their children as the 14 Mother and Baby Institutions, and that the State had a regulatory or inspection function, then there will be a mechanism to add such an institution to the Schedule of eligible institutions.</p></reply>

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible.</p>  <p>  The Act allows the Government, by Order, to direct an intervention at a particular site where the criteria for manifestly inappropriate burials are met and to approve the appointment of a Director of Authorised Intervention to oversee and manage a phased, step-by-step approach to the excavation, recovery, analysis, identification (if possible) and re-interment of the remains.</p>  <p>  On 4 October the Government made an order to establish an independent Office to lead an intervention at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway, under the Institutional Burials Act 2022. The making of the Order follows on from Resolutions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad last month approving the draft Order that was agreed by Government in July.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government Order, the functions of the Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam will include carrying out a DNA Identification Programme, which involves taking DNA samples from eligible family members and human remains buried at a site and analysis of those samples by Forensic Science Ireland. The purpose of the analysis is to compare DNA profiles to establish if there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at the site and the human remains that are recovered.</p>  <p>  The Act defines an eligible family member as a person who has reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is a child, parent, sibling, half-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew (whether of the whole blood or the half-blood), grandniece or grandnephew of the person who is buried at an intervention site.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that Forensic Science Ireland can establish the Databases that will allow for DNA profile comparison following receipt of a notification from the Director that an Identification Programme is continuing. A decision to continue with an Identification Programme is taken by a Director where he or she is satisfied that there are family members of deceased persons still alive who may wish to participate in the Programme and where Forensic Science Ireland has determined that the quality of samples tested are sufficient to enable DNA profile comparison.</p>  <p>  I intend to appoint a Director to head up the Office as soon as possible. My officials have been liaising with the Public Appointments Service on the recruitment process for the post and it is expected that once the post is advertised, the appointment of the Director will take a number of weeks. When appointed, the Director will make arrangements for a public information campaign to promote awareness of the Identification Programme, including how family members can notify the Director of his or her interest in participating in the Programme, in line with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  The abhorrent situation discovered in Tuam is, so far, unique. However, the legislation is not site specific and allows for interventions, including identification programmes, should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered elsewhere.</p></reply>

It involves partnership with families, practitioners, communities and national stakeholders to deliver better outcomes for children and families living in areas where poverty is most deeply entrenched.</p><p>The ABC Programme was funded jointly by Atlantic Philanthropies and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs between 2013 and 2018.  Nine new sites came on board over the period 2014/2015 following extensive evaluations across the three initial programmes in Darndale, Ballymun and Tallaght. The nine new areas were selected based on the levels of deprivation within their defined catchment areas, as well as evidence of inter-agency collaboration and implementation readiness.</p><p>Since 2018, my Department has funded the ABC Programme as part of Tulsa&rsquo;s Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Service. In addition to the ABC Programme, Tusla funds a wide variety of family and parenting support services in all parts of the country.</p><p>Currently, my Department is supporting Tusla to scale up proven prevention and early intervention models from the ABC Programme including the Preparing for Life home visiting programme, Early Talkboost language programme and muti-disciplinary Infant Mental Health Networks.</p><p>Over the past number of years, all ABC areas had to adapt their service delivery model to ensure continuity of support to the children and families they work with. Many of the parenting programmes were delivered online and home visits, where possible, took place in outdoor settings ensuring public health guidelines were adhered to. Most of the ABC work has now returned to in-person delivery, but some services may maintain a hybrid model of delivery, where this is deemed to best the needs of parents and families.</p><p>In the six months from Jan to June 2022, the 12 ABC sites engaged 10,127 parents and 27,274 children in various interventions and 4,474 professionals in training and capacity building work.

For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer with the employer paying the apprentice during both on-the-job and off-the-job training elements of the apprenticeship.</p><p>For the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes, the minimum rates of pay applying under the employment contract are either agreed within the relevant sector, or are set out in legally binding Sectoral Employment Orders recommended by the Labour Court. These minimum rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four.</p><p>Periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund with payments of the agreed rate made directly to craft apprentices by the education and training boards during this time.</p><p>Training allowances for apprentices are calculated with reference to gross-wage norms payable in industry for the different trade sectors. The actual allowance received will generally be less as it is based on the net take home pay calculated based on the gross wage norm. The gross-wage norm is per week and the norm to be used will be determined by the industry in which the employer is engaged.</p><p>On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates.</p><p>While attending off-the-job training, craft apprentices are paid a training allowance appropriate to their training phase. In addition to training allowances, craft apprentices attending phases of off-the-job training in an Education and Training Board (ETB) training centre, Institute of Technology, or a Technological University are entitled to make an application for either travel or accommodation allowances for the duration of the period of off-the-job training.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023 I announced a cost-of-living package for students, and investment in third level education for 2023. Included in this was a once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices and additional funding for social inclusion measures in apprenticeship, such as a bursary for apprentices from under-represented groups.</p><p>As employees, apprentices who find themselves in difficulty are correspondingly entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. I would also advise any apprentice to discuss the matter with their Authorised Officer who may be in a position to provide guidance<b><i>.</i></b></p></reply>

In fact, one of the very first actions I took after my appointment as Minister in 2020 was to write to all publicly funded higher education institutions outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting that institutions take a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. All publicly-funded institutions now have such action plans in place.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:</p>  <p>  - NUIG Active Consent Programme;</p>  <p>  - UCC Bystander Training;</p>  <p>  - Speak Out report and support online platform; and</p>  <p>  - The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWC in conjunction with USI.</p>  <p>  My Department is also partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Justice in this key policy area and has provided a number of actions for inclusion in the Third Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy which my colleague Minister McEntee published in June.</p>  <p>  I fully support the core principle underpinning the new strategy that we must take a zero tolerance approach. Everyone is entitled to a safe environment to study and work free from violence and harassment, and that informs the policy approaches and interventions that have been adopted across the sector. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I launched the reports on the National Surveys of Student and Staff Experiences of Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment in Higher Education back in January. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings. My officials have been working in recent months with the HEA and key stakeholders to review the recommendations contained in these reports and I intend to make a further announcement on the plans to implement these recommendations shortly. </p>  <p>  The creation of an institutional campus culture in each of our higher education institutions which is safe, respectful and supportive, is a key priority for me. I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

The reduction will only apply where students are attending approved undergraduate free fees courses and where the student is eligible for free fees.</p>  <p>  In terms of students attending courses in Northern Ireland, courses provided in Northern Ireland are not approved courses under the Free Fees schemes and therefore the once off student contribution support of &euro;1,000 in 22/23 cannot apply to students undertaking study in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The main support available to assist students with the cost of higher education is the Student Grant Scheme.

This measure excludes postgraduate students who receive the Special Rate of grant as they have their tuition fee contribution paid up to &euro;6,270.

Full time PhD student funded through an award by IRC or SFI will receive a once off increase in their stipend of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  Students can determine their eligibility for the Grant at susi.ie/eligibility/income/. This provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  For postgraduate students experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

Therefore the once off student contribution reduction of &euro;1,000 in 22/23 cannot apply to students undertaking a course of postgraduate study. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous institutions and therefore it is a matter for individual institutions to determine the rate of tuition fees for postgraduate academic programmes.</p></reply>

This includes PLC, undergraduate and Postgraduate Students who are in receipt of the Special Rate of Grant.</p>  <p>  All higher education students who are eligible for the fees initiative will benefit from a once off reduction in the Student Contribution rate of &euro;1,000 for the 2022/2023 academic year.  For those on the 50% Student Contribution rate this reduction will mean that the balance the student pays to their Higher Education Institution will be &euro;1,000 (a reduction of &euro;500) for the current academic year. </p>  <p>  PhD students funded by the SFI and the IRC will also benefit from a once off payment of &euro;500 in the current academic year.</p>  <p>  Post Graduate Students who meet the eligibility criteria for a Postgraduate Fee Contribution Grant will benefit from a once off increase in this grant of &euro;1,000 from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am increasing all maintenance grants effective from January 2023 in order to provide further financial assistance to those students most in need. The special rate and Band 1 rate of maintenance will increase by 14% and all other maintenance grant rates will increase by 10%.  Students in the current academic year will see their grant payments increase proportionately once this measure comes into effect from January 2023. </p>  <p>  Further measures will be introduced from September 2023 that will increase the level of support available to students attending third level.  Those who are assessed as having a reckonable income of between &euro;55,240 and &euro;62,000 will be eligible for a 50% student contribution grant and those who are assessed as having a reckonable income of between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000 will be eligible for a grant of &euro;500 towards their student contribution fees. This change should lead to an estimated 42,500 - 50,000 families receiving support under the student grant scheme for the first time.  PhD students who receive an IRC or SFI award will see a &euro;500 increase to the stipend baseline in 2023 from &euro;18,500 to &euro;19,000.</p>  <p>  These significant measures will see students have more money in their pockets to help them tackle the challenges posed by the cost-of-living crisis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have secured a further &euro;8 million of funding for the Student Assistance Fund for the current academic year.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Fund provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.

For the academic year 2022/23, I increased the income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant by &euro;1,000.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I have secured a significant cost of living package for third level students including a once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes.</p><p>The once off &euro;1,000 support relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under the Department free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. It will reduce the student contribution payable for free fees eligible students from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. </p><p>In addition, I have made two changes to the income thresholds for the student contribution grant for the academic year <i>2023/24</i>which will reduce the cost of education for students and families. I have increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution and introduced a new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. It is estimated that between 42,500 and 50,000 families could receive support under the Student Grant Scheme in 2023 for the first time as a result of these measures.</p><p>I have introduced two further measures whereby students can deduct income up to &euro;14,000 as declared to Revenue under the Government's Rent a Room Scheme as well as an increased amount income earned by them outside of term time from &euro;4,500 to &euro;6,552 from their reckonable income when calculating the income for the 2023/24 Student Grant Scheme. Some students may find that they will receive a higher rate of grant and some new students may also find themselves eligible for a grant for the first time once these measures are introduced.</p><p>In addition for the 2022/2023 Academic Year a further &euro;8 million of funding has been secured for the Student Assistance Fund for the current academic year.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Fund provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It is designed to provide a source of financial support in addition to a SUSI grant.</p><p>Applications can be made under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) through the Access Office in the third level institution you are attending.

However, I do understand from both students who have written to me and engagement with the relevant higher education institutions that the availability of such loans has been important in supporting people, including mature students, to study medicine. </p><p>Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one<b></b>of the pathways to study medicine. Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 21/22 the state contribution was &euro;11,950 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme Review comments on the issue of Graduate Entry Medicine and states that a wider issues remains as to whether greater flexibility in the criteria for student grant scheme could be considered in areas of critical skills shortage reflecting graduate entry routes. There are significant policy, legislative and funding considerations, as well as wider implications, if the current treatment of graduate entry medicine was amended. However, all elements of the review will be subject to consideration by my Department through the annual estimates processes.</p><p>I have been actively considering the range of policy and funding tools we have available to increase the supply of domestic medical graduates, which has involved considerable engagement with the medical schools and the Department of Health. On the 12th July last, I, along with the Minister for Health, announced an agreement with the Irish medical schools to increase the number of places available for EU students by 200 over the next five years. The agreement reached with the medical schools has begun with an additional 60 EU students in September 2022, which will climb to 120 in September 2023, and up to 200 by 2026. This marks a significant expansion in the number of places available to students applying through the CAO system. It increases the opportunities for students to progress to study medicine in Ireland and to help build our talent pipeline. Budget 2023 saw a significant increase in the amount the State pays for medicine places, including graduate entry. As part of this agreement, the state contribution for new places will increase to &euro;14,500. For existing places, an increase in the state contribution to this level will be phased in.</p><p>The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (NAP) identifies target groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education who would not have considered attending higher education without such supports.The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanise established to implement the National Access Plan (NAP).There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH).Strand 2 provides bursaries (1916 Bursary) to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. I have recently changed the rules so that students who hold a 1916 Bursary may continue their bursary if they wish to participate in Graduate Entry Medicine. </p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, revenue.ie.</p></reply>

In this regard any repeat fees payable by a student will vary by institution.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023 the Government has approved a once off state support of &euro;1,000 towards the student contribution payable by students eligible for free tuition fees under my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for funding under the FFI, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including the progression and repeat year period of study criteria.

It is a clear statement of our collective commitment to preventing such heinous crimes. A substantial majority of Council of Europe member states, 38 in total, have aligned with the Declaration, giving it a clear political mandate within the Council of Europe.</p>  <p>  The commitments outlined in the Declaration are fully in line with the actions of Zero Tolerance, our Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, which I launched in June. </p>  <p>  This new plan has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV, or the attitudes which underpin these crimes. </p>  <p>  This is a whole-of-society plan of action for Ireland which is structured on the four pillars of the Istanbul convention &ndash; prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination. The accompanying implementation plan contains 144 detailed actions for implementation this year and next. Implementation will be ensured by strong oversight and coordination at central Government level.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2023 I have secured an extra &euro;9m, which represents a 22pc increase, for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence. This record level of funding will also support the implementation of this new action plan.</p>  <p>  This additional &euro;9 million includes increased funding of &euro;7m for organisations funded by TUSLA to address acute demands in existing services throughout the country, and for investment in new services as outlined in the new Strategy.</p>  <p>  This funding also strengthens the nationwide supports and services for victims of crime (&euro;920,000), provides for targeted awareness raising campaigns (&euro;750,000) and for work to establish the new DSGBV statutory agency (&euro;450,000) which will become operational in January 2024. The new agency will ensure we deliver excellent services, supports and accommodation and set world class standards in this area.</p></reply>

The court fee for each Special Exemption Order is now &euro;150, rather than &euro;300 as was the case previously. Excise duty, payable to the Revenue Commissioners, is now &euro;55 rather than &euro;110 as was the case previously. This means that the cost of a Special Exemption Order comes to a total of &euro;205 instead of &euro;410.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Justice Plan 2022 commits to publishing and enacting new laws to update and modernise alcohol licensing laws in Ireland. I am delivering on that commitment by preparing Heads of a General Scheme of a Sale of Alcohol Bill.</p>  <p>  The objective of the proposed Bill is to repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, and to replace them with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. In addition, codifying alcohol licensing law into a single Act will make it more accessible and user-friendly for the licensed trade, courts, Garda&iacute; and the public. Special Exemption Orders are being reviewed in the context of the Sale of Alcohol Bill.</p>  <p>  Work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the General Scheme is advancing well and it is intended to progress this legislation in the months ahead. Submissions from stakeholders will, of course, be carefully considered in the context of publication of the forthcoming Bill.</p>  <p>  Details of the proposed reform will be included in the General Scheme when published.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it. </p>  <p>  In June, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. As part of this it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Strategy commits to the delivery of additional refuge spaces nationally and aims to address the current shortfall, double the number of refuge spaces in the medium term, and meet the targets set out in the Istanbul Convention in the longer term. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we aim to have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes as a key part of this.</p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family   Agency completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised. </p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.</p>  <p>  The 12 priority locations nationwide identified include Carlow, where eight family places are suggested as a potential refuge size requirement.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to improve how effectively, we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible while ensuring a high standard of quality.</p>  <p>  The strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

This is a complex issue as, in many cases, the adult in question is known to the child and may in some cases even be a family member, causing potential issues with regard to witness testimony. It is also important to ensure that new legislation in this area is aimed at the adults who control criminality, without risking further criminalisation of children, some of whom may be involved in directing the criminal activities of other children.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to developing a law which would take account of this and penalise adults for the exploitation and harm done to the child in such cases.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that officials in my Department are already working to develop legislation in this regard.

Numbers are particularly high when the Courts are at their busiest and following the return to a more normal level of Court activity, committal numbers have increased across the prison system. The Deputy may wish to know that there were 5,219 committals to prison for the period January to September 2022 which is a 13% increase on the same period in 2021. </p>  <p>  I am informed by my officials in the Prison Service that the total number of prisoners in custody on 10 October 2022 was 4,196 compared with a bed capacity of 4,471. This represents an occupancy level of 94%.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Government has provided significant capital funding to the Irish Prison Service in order to enhance the existing prison infrastructure, eliminate the practice known as slopping out, and to provide additional capacity where required. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the works completed in recent years to modernise the entire Mountjoy Prison complex, the construction of a new prison in Cork  and the provision of additional prisoner accommodation in the Midlands Prison. </p>  <p>  This year, the Irish Prison Service reopened the newly refurbished Training Unit Place of Detention as a centre for older prisoners in Mountjoy and this has provided an additional 96 prisoner spaces.  The construction of a new male wing and a female prison is underway in Limerick Prison and will provide 90 additional male and 22 additional female cell spaces.  The new accommodation is expected to become operational by the end of 2022 assuming there is no further impact on construction activity or supply chain issues due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Significant growth has been experienced in the remand prison population in recent years which has resulted in pressures on remand prison facilities including Cloverhill Prison. The Irish Prison Service is currently undertaking a strategic assessment exercise on the potential for additional accommodation at Cloverhill Prison in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Programme for Government 2020 contains a broad range of policies and proposals that represent a coherent approach to enhancing and sustaining a more just and safe society, with a specific commitment to review policy options for prison and penal reform. In respect of delivering on this commitment, I recently published the Review of Policy Options for Prison and Penal Reform 2022-2024. </p>  <p>  The review seeks to find the balance between ensuring that people who commit serious crimes receive a punishment and a period of incarceration proportionate to that crime, while at the same time acknowledging that sometimes community based sanctions are more appropriate in diverting offenders away from future criminal activity. </p>  <p>  Sentencing is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence. While these proposals do not change this, they are intended to strengthen the options available to judges when they are considering cases, to facilitate the effective and efficient use of community sanctions by the courts, and to ensure that the courts have a wide range of appropriate options for dealing with people who have committed minor offences.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of delivering the Penal Policy action plan, the need to ensure the continued availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will continue to be central to the work of the Irish Prison Service and will be core to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023.</p></reply>

Supporting documentation was received in the Ankara visa office on the 18 May 2022 where it awaits examination and processing.</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the granting or refusal of study visas are made in a number of Visa Offices overseas, in my Department's Visa Office in Dublin, and at certain Embassies of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which process certain visa applications under delegated sanction from my Department.</p>  <p>  Applications from Turkish residents are normally processed by the Visa Office in Ankara. Visa processing times for the Ankara Visa Office are published online by the Department of Foreign Affairs at dfa.ie/irish-embassy/turkey/visas/visas-for-ireland-weekly-decisions-report/. The Ankara Visa Office has seen an almost 50% increase in visa applications received in the year to date to the end of September 2022 in comparison with the same period in 2019 (before COVID-19 related travel restrictions). Long stay study visas accounting for more than 45% of those being received in 2022. In addition to this increase in applications, the Ankara Visa Office has received an extremely high number of incomplete applications, which is also adding to the longer processing times, given the resources that have to go into examining these applications.</p>  <p>  The processing time at each Visa Office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as: the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result. </p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to give a definitive date as to when this application will be finalised. All applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt. Applicants are advised not to pay for airline or other travel tickets without having first been issued with a visa. The applicant will be notified as soon as a decision has been reached by a Visa Officer.</p></reply>

The allocation of appointments for registration and renewal with GNIB, for some 50 locations nationwide, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Registration office in Burgh Quay operated during the Covid 19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines. However, since February 2022, the Registration Office has been open and operating at maximum capacity.</p>  <p>  Any person registering for the first time is required to attend at their local registration office in person and, as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 800 630) was introduced for customers. </p>  <p>  The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. So far this year, the Registration Office of my Department has issued and processed over 50,000 appointments. </p>  <p>  Additionally, if a non-EEA national is residing in the Dublin area and has an existing valid permission to be in the State, then they do not need to seek an appointment to attend in person to renew their permission. An online renewal facility was launched in July 2020 to processes renewals and there has been 173,000 approx. registrations renewed online since the facility was launched.</p></reply>

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  </p>  <p>  Last June, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. As part of this it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Strategy commits to delivering additional refuge spaces nationally to address the current shortfall, double the number of refuge spaces in the medium term, and meet the targets set out in the Istanbul Convention in the longer term. This effect of the implementation of the Strategy will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces over the next 5 years. By the end of the strategy we aim to have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes as a key part of this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.</p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to improve how effectively we deliver refuge spaces.</p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible while ensuring a high standard of quality.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that development of refuges in the priority areas will be characterised by local interagency working, with key stakeholders involved throughout the process. I have secured resources to make a range of supports available to organisations and communities taking forward development of refuges and associated services, including project management support and resourcing to bring staffing and organisational processes to the level required for operation of these sensitive, high-risk services.</p>  <p>  The Strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the Strategy in 2026.</p></reply>

He specified GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic, aural, home support, home nursing, counselling, chiropody and physiotherapy services and formed the opinion that the health provisions should operate in a manner similar to the scheme made available to certain persons under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, these services were agreed by the then Government and were legislated for by the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 (RWRCI Act).  </p>  <p>  It has been commented on that Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report also included the recommendation that Magdalen women should have access to the full range of services currently enjoyed by holders of the Hepatitis C HAA card. However, the HAA services differ from the range of services explicitly recommended in the report and this difference was not reconciled in the report. However, Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the HAA services were reproduced for illustrative purposes and recognised that not all of the HAA services described may be relevant to the Magdalen women. In fact, Judge Quirke&rsquo;s draft legislation in the report did not include all the services that were provided for under the 2015 Act. The Act is based on the specific areas recommended by Judge Quirke on page 6 of the report. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for HAA services is based on the Health Amendment Act 1996. The purpose of the 1996 Act was to meet the health care needs of persons who contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion. It is generally accepted that these hepatitis C patients are a particularly vulnerable group who have specific health needs as a result of their infection. It is apparent that the Quirke Report recognises that the Magdalen women and the groups of people who contracted Hepatitis C are not identical and face different circumstances. In that light, it is not unreasonable to provide eligibility entitlements tailored to women who were admitted to and worked in a relevant institution and who are now facing medical circumstances that are typical of that age cohort. It should be noted that Judge Quirke did not identify complementary therapies, such as reflexology, aromatherapy, massage, hydrotherapy and acupuncture, or other alternative therapies as health services meeting the medical needs of the women.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-11a.1685.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101100100#WRCC04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 633 and 634 together.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>  All participants within the NHSS contribute up to 80% of their income (40% if part of a couple) and 7.5% per annum of the value of their assets (3.75% if part of a couple). The first &euro;36,000 (&euro;72,000 if part of a couple) is excluded from assessment.</p><p>  Assets assessed include cash assets as well as non-cash assets such as the principal private residence, other property and land, including farmland.</p><p>  For the purposes of financial assessment, income includes:- Earnings, including income from farming or business activities- Pension income- Social welfare benefits/allowances- Rental income- Income from holding an office or directorship- Income from fees, commissions, dividends or interest</p><p>  Transferred assets and income, defined as assets or income transferred to another person up to five years before a person's application to the scheme, are also assessed.</p><p>  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence.</p><p>  Last year, the Department of Health introduced the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which became operational in October 2021. This introduced a three-year cap on contributions from family farm and business assets, provided that a family successor is appointed to run the asset for at least 6 years. The Act also extended the three-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a principal residence, which means that, from the fourth year in care onwards and provided the house was sold while the person is in care, a nursing home resident may sell their principal private residence without incurring additional costs.</p><p>In addition, the Government has made a policy change to the NHSS to remove a disincentive for participants in the Scheme to rent out their principal residence after they have entered long term residential care. The rate of assessment on rental income from the principal residence will be reduced from 80% to 40%. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8.</p><p>  The change was made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was approved by the Oireachtas on 30th June and signed into law by President Higgins in July. It is expected that the necessary administrative and operational changes will soon be in place and the amendment will become fully operational shortly thereafter.</p><p>  It should be noted that the NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person  - Bed and board  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living  - Laundry service - A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.  </p><p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p></reply>

The NCPE may advise that a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is recommended, which would then be commissioned by the HSE as per the agreed processes.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications.  </p>  <p>  The Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members. The pharmacoeconomic report will be reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and any patient group submission(s) received. The HSE Drugs Group will consider all of the evidence and make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team.  </p>  <p>  The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team. The HSE Executive Management Team decides on the basis of all the demands it is faced with (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new use of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  1. In terms of the specific details of the application(s) for pricing and reimbursement of Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) received by the HSE (as of 10th October 2022) for licensed indications in oesophageal cancer are listed below. The HSE cannot make any comment on possible outcomes from the ongoing assessment processes. </p>  <p>  - The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of a new indication for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) monotherapy on the 14th December 2020 from BMS (the applicant) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based combination chemotherapy.  </p>  <p>  - The HSE commissioned the Rapid Review process on the 15th December 2020. The assessment report was received by the HSE on the 13th January 2021. The NCPE did not recommend a full HTA and recommended this application not be considered for reimbursement at the submitted price. CPU engaged in commercial negotiations with the applicant in March 2021. The Rapid Review report?was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations. The HSE Drugs Group did not recommend in favour of reimbursement of Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) for this indication at their September 2021 meeting. </p>  <p>  2. The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of a new indication for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) on the 30th June 2022 from BMS (the applicant) for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with tumour cell PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) expression ≥1%.  </p>  <p>  - The HSE commissioned the Rapid Review process on the 1st July 2022. The assessment report was submitted to the HSE on the 29th of July 2022. The NCPE recommended a full HTA for this indication, which was commissioned by the HSE on the 31st of August 2022. The HSE Drugs Group will consider all of the evidence and make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team.</p>  <p>  3. The HSE received an application for pricing-reimbursement of a new indication for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) on the 21st September 2021 from BMS (the applicant) for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with oesophageal, or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer who have residual pathologic disease following prior neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.   </p>  <p>  - The HSE commissioned the Rapid Review process on the 21st September 2021. The assessment report was received by the HSE on the 20th October 2021. The NCPE recommended a full HTA for this indication, which was commissioned by the HSE on the 28th of October 2021. The HSE Drugs Group will consider all of the evidence and make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team.</p>  <p>  4. The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of a new indication for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) on the 29th October 2021 from BMS (the applicant) for Nivolumab (Opdivo&reg;) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy for the first line treatment of adult patients with HER2 negative advanced or metastatic gastric, gastro oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥5.  </p>  <p>  - The HSE commissioned the Rapid Review process on the 1st November 2021. The assessment report was received by the HSE on the 29th November 2021. The NCPE recommended a full HTA for this indication, which was commissioned by the HSE on the 7th of December 2021. The HSE Drugs Group will consider all of the evidence and make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team.</p>  <p>  5. The HSE has not received an application (as of 10th October 2022) for &lsquo;Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument No. 277 of 1971 sets out the following limitation on Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970: "Arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines to persons suffering from mental illness in pursuance of section 59 (3) of the Act shall be made only in respect of persons under the age of 16 years."</p>  <p>  Therefore, the HSE must regard 16 years as the upper age limit in terms of eligibility under the LTI scheme for those with a diagnosis of mental illness.</p>  <p>  The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. However, it is not possible at this juncture to say what the outcome of this review will be.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 38,287 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 123,750 .</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments.  </p><p>It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>- Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE;  </p><p>- Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </p><p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place.At this point, the Department is not in a position to assess or comment on individual cases. </p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention.</p></reply>

For a specialty breakdown for basic and higher specialty training across each of these training years please refer the HSE National Doctors Training and Planning Office annual medical workforce reports available here  www.hse.ie/eng/staff/leadership-education-development/met/ed/rep/. </p><p>Appendix 4 shows the number of doctors who have graduated each discipline of medicine 2016- 2022.</p><p>In relation to the number of doctors that are still working in Ireland five years, ten years, 20 years, 30 years and 40 years, HSE-NDTP have recently commenced a review of doctors who complete Internship in Ireland. Early provisional data shows that a high percentage of interns who graduate leave Ireland for at least one year. However, the data shows that 82% of interns who commenced one year intern training in July 2015 subsequently commenced a Basic Specialist Training (BST) or General Practice (GP) training programme in subsequent years (2016-2021). A small number of the 2015 group also remain in the Irish system either in service grade posts or employed within the Private Sector. Data used in this project is collected from the NDTP Doctors Integrated Management E-System (DIME), implemented in the 2015/2016 training year<i>.</i></p><p>The Medical Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of doctors in Ireland. To protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practise medicine in Ireland meet the requirements to practise as set out in legislation. The Medical Council also plays a role in the supply of doctors through setting and monitoring standards and guidelines which all basic medical degree programmes, intern and specialist training programmes in Ireland are required to meet and has the role of assuring the quality of undergraduate education of doctors and quality of postgraduate training of specialists. </p><p>The Medical Council also supports workforce planning by the research projects it undertakes annually, such as the Medical Workforce Intelligence Report. This report provides a detailed analysis of the Medical Council&rsquo;s registration data, focusing on demographics of those retaining and withdrawing from the medical register in Ireland. The Medical Workforce Intelligence Report is a central document in informing workforce planning and improved patient safety in Ireland.</p><p>In relation to the number of students who are still working in Ireland after they have graduated the Deputy may be aware that the CSO has developed a statistical framework known as the 'Educational Longitudinal Database' (ELD) in collaboration with Irish public sector bodies to examine learner outcomes. The ELD is produced by matching datasets on learners that have completed courses or programmes to other datasets which describe their outcomes in subsequent years. The data sources used to describe learner outcomes include employment and self-employment datasets from Revenue, benefits data from the Department of Social Protection, and data on educational participation from the Department of Education and several state agencies, including the Higher Education Authority (HEA), Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and SOLAS. As part of the strategic workforce planning function in my Department, officials are exploring the potential of this database to examine the outcomes, including employment outcomes, for students of health and social care courses in Ireland.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e., mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. On 1 November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>   However, I can advise the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes that may be required are considered in the context of Government policy, and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

The rate of assessment for rental income from all principal residences will be reduced from 80% to 40%. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8.</p><p>The change was made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was approved by the Oireachtas on 30th June and signed into law by President Higgins in July. It is expected that the necessary administrative and operational changes will soon be in place and the amendment will become fully operational shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration at this time as these are our immediate priorities.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as wide a catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p>  <p>The locations were also chosen in line with good practice which suggests that, in order to maximise economies of scale, dedicated, standalone elective centres should be &ldquo;as big as is reasonably possible&rdquo; to meet identified demand while providing appropriate population coverage. Locating the new facilities in Cork, Dublin and Galway will enable the provision of a national service, while aiming to maximise the coverage of the ECCs as far as is reasonably possible. A central point of introducing these new facilities is not that they will only benefit the subset of the population that sit within their direct catchment but rather that the introduction of this new delivery capability into the Public Healthcare System will benefit the whole population, including those who do not fall within the immediate geographical catchment. It is envisaged that the Cork and Galway facilities combined will cater for up to 350,000 patients/procedures annually.</p>  <p>  The Government has made clear that progressing the elective hospital route is the way to go and we are taking all steps to fast track this proposal within the current requirements of the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

Membership of the Group comprised of national and international experts with experience across a range of key domains, including public health, health protection, epidemiology, senior public health service leadership, change management, and risk and evidence communication.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Advisory Group was submitted to me in September and I am now giving consideration to it's contents. Following consideration, I plan to bring the Report to Government shortly, with a view to publishing it thereafter.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Expert Group and details of its membership can be found online: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/8beb5-ministers-for-health-establish-the-public-health-reform-expert-advisory-group/.</p></reply>

The business case has been subject to internal review and the External Assurance Process (EAP) (introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) in late 2021 for projects over &euro;100m) is underway. </p>  <p>  The independent scrutiny processes for major capital projects at Decision Gates 1 and 2 of the PSC- the introduction of the External Assurance Process and review by the Major Projects Advisory Group- have been established to ensure appropriate project preparation, to further strengthen project management, and ultimately improve project outcomes.</p>  <p>  For the External Assurance Process, D/PER established a single lot, multi-supplier framework from which funding Departments can source the independent reviewers to conduct the reviews. A Supplementary Request for Tenders from this established framework to conduct the Decision Gate 2 EAP review on the business case documentation for the relocation of the NMH was circulated. Following a tender evaluation process, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was engaged by the Department of Health,  as it was determined that it submitted the most economically advantageous tender to perform the EAP review.</p>  <p>  The EAP for the NMH relocation is well advanced and is expected to conclude in the coming weeks. As the contract is yet to be concluded no fees have yet been paid. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to update the business case documentation in line with external review recommendations so that an updated business case can be submitted to the Major Projects Advisory Group. Pending favourable review under the Public Spending Code requirements, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted by Government, the project can move to deployment of a tendering strategy.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to comment on matters that are sub-judice.</p>  <p>  However, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I met with members of the Irish Thalidomide Association in February last and assured them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide them with the necessary health supports to meet their related needs.</p>  <p>  Following that meeting, the designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs, commenced a process to develop recommendations for future planning and pathways of care for survivor&rsquo;s health care needs now and into the future. The recommendations will also inform the work already underway in the Department to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory footing as committed to by the Government.</p>  <p>  Following a Government decision in 1975, Irish survivors of thalidomide have been in receipt of monthly payments for life from the Irish State.  The range of supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor also include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, which includes access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment and housing adaptations. </p>  <p>  The German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p></reply>
