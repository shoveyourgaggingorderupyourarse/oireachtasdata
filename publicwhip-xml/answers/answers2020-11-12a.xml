    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-12a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200056#WRA00700"><p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) which has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally. The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP).  </p>  <p>  The NTA seeks to deliver an efficient, accessible and integrated public transport system in rural and urban Ireland. Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and SPSV services (Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney). The NTA funds public bus services in rural areas such as County Longford through its public service obligation (PSO) arrangements, mainly with Bus &Eacute;ireann, and also through the Rural Transport Programme, which now operates under the Local Link brand. Commercial bus operators also provide key transport services in the county including Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services 22 and 23, M4 Direct, Farrelly's Coaches and Geraghty Travel, among others.</p>  <p>  From a policy perspective, the Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in relation to improving public transport services in rural areas. Among the measures being prioritised are:</p>  <p>  - is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system,</p>  <p>  - expanding the Local Link rural transport service, and</p>  <p>  - prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity.  </p>  <p>  Last week I published a report of a public consultation process which was undertaken by the Department between November 2019 and February 2020 on a review of sustainable mobility policy, including the issue of rural transport. I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government right across the sustainable mobility programme. Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. </p>  <p>  In relation to improved services for rural areas, the NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the Greater Dublin Area, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.</p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is starting on a two phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland';  this engagement will begin with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q2 2021 on the detailed proposals.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-12a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200056#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 66 together.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibliity for ensuring the provision of public transport services, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - which owns and operates the rail network - provides passenger rail services under public service obliation (PSO) arrangements with the NTA.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asks about the future of the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line; I can assure him first of all that there are no plans for the closure of any part of the rail network.  Indeed our firm intention is to invest heavily in the quality of the network and the size of the rail fleet, in order to address capacity constraints and expand services in many parts of the country.  Initiatives such as the Cork Line Re-Laying Programme will improve journey times for passengers and increase the attractiveness of rail as a sustainable travel option.  Ambitious fleet investment programmes will also see the overall Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann fleet grow over the coming years, with 41 additional Intercity Railcar carriages currently contracted, and a further contract for up to 600 carriages over the coming decade set to be awarded in 2021.  These initiatives will help expand capacity in areas where it is badly needed and areas where future population growth and development is expected. </p>  <p>  However, the route about which the Deputy asks is not a route that has been struggling to accommodate large passenger numbers.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann identifies Ballybrophy to Limerick as a continually low-density route in terms of passenger numbers, although the company has, over many years, operated varying levels of services during periods of both economic growth and recession.  I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also undertaken both national and local promotions on the route, but that such efforts have not resulted in any significant uptake and passenger numbers have remained very low.  In this context, the NTA has no plans at present to increase services on this particular route.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann promotes usage of rail services, both in national promotion and through local initiatives.  I am told that it has a number of partnerships which support this, including on the Ballybrophy-Limerick route.  The company has stated that it will continue to promote all routes and engage with local communities to seek new business opportunities and examine the potential for revisions and enhancements to timetables which will benefit specific customer groups.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy is probably aware that some track and bridge renewal works are taking place at present along the line.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects that these works will be concluded by this Sunday, with some bus transfers operating between Limerick and Nenagh in the meantime.  The company advises that full services are due to resume on Monday, 16th November.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-12a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200056#WRA01400"><p>My Department is in constant contact with the Road Safety Authority since the start of the pandemic regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 on those services, and how they can best be maintained in the current circumstances.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, car driving tests were first temporarily suspended due to the Covid-19 in March 2020 and since resuming operations in mid-July, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog. Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity has had to be considerably reduced. This means that customers experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended.  </p>  <p>  Under Covid Level 5 restrictions which took effect for six weeks from 22 October 2020, driving tests are now only available to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work. While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety must remain of paramount importance. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints when driver testing resumes after Level 5, and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the RSA has also rehired a further 19 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity when services resume. In the longer term the Department is considering proposals by the RSA for further measures to address the backlog.</p>  <p>  As the operation of the driver testing service is the statutory responsibility of the RSA, I have referred the part of the question relating to numbers of cancellations and approach to prioritization after Level 5 to the RSA for direct answer.</p></reply>

In light of this any testing for international travel will need to draw on resources from the private sector which are not being accessed by the HSE. </p>  <p>   The testing regime envisaged under the Government decision for international travel will involve increasing the private supply of testing availability in Ireland. This will include:</p>  <p>  - testing post-arrival (from day 5) for passengers from EU orange or red list locations; and</p>  <p>  - testing for departing passengers who need or wish to complete a pre-departure test before travelling to another country.</p>  <p>  Subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a Covid-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is the only test that is accepted for the purposes of allowing the advice relating to restricted movement to be waived. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, include LAMP and antigen testing. </p>  <p>  Shannon and Cork Airports have indicated that drive-through testing will be available today, for passengers and the public. The daa has indicated that testing at Dublin Airport by private providers can be increased within weeks. </p>  <p>  As there can be no certaintly that testing capacity will meet potential demand, intending passengers are advised that appointments for testing should be sought in good time before travelling.</p>  <p>  With Ireland currently at level 5 of the Living with Covid-19 Plan, there should be no non-essential travel of any kind within or outside of Ireland for coming weeks. The focus is on fighting the virus, and any incoming passengers must comply with Level 5 public health measures.</p>  <p>  Passengers from Green regions may enter Ireland without restricting their movements.</p>  <p>  The default for Passengers from all other countries not on the Green list is to restrict their movements for 14 days.  Since 9 November, the advice to those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived, if they have a negative or "not detected" result from a  PCR test result taken up to three days before the date of departure for Ireland. </p>  <p>  Passengers arriving from red locations from the 29 November will not be requested to follow advice to restrict movements following receipt of a negative or "not detected" result from a PCR test conducted at least 5 days after arrival. Such PCR tests may be obtained from private providers and should be paid for by the passenger. This provision will also be made available to arrivals from orange locations who do not avail of a pre-departure test. </p>  <p>  Passengers arriving from 3rd countries (i.e. outside the EU/EEA and UK) will be subject to the same measures as for red or grey locations, including the exemptions for essential travel or functions. </p>  <p>  The Government has also aligned with the European recommendation for categories of traveller that may be exempted from advice to restrict movements. </p>  <p>  My Department engages with European colleagues on an ongoing basis, through a range of European and International groupings. The Protocol for the management of air passengers inlight of Covid-19, as published in consultation with the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee and National Civil Aviation Development Forum, is aligned to the European Aviation Safety Agency and  European Centre for Disease Control (EASA/ECDC) Guidance.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has indicated a desire for greater harmonisation and coordination around the EU approach for international travel. It recently requested  EASA/ECDC is to develop a protocol for safer air travel, including a proposal for a common EU Health Safety testingprotocol at airports. A number of European countries are currentlly involved in pilot projects to better understand the role that dfferent types of rapid testing for Covid-19 might have in an international travel context.</p></reply>

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Act 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the upgrading, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the National Roads Programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan (NDP).  In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the National Roads Programme. </p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF). This provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  </p><p>The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p><p>In 2020, &euro;230m is allocated from TII&rsquo;s capital budget for essential asset rehabilitation on existing national road routes across the country, including cyclical road pavement resurfacing/renewals, bridge rehabilitation and other asset renewal/improvement works (including safety works).</p><p><b><i>N71, Bantry to Dunnamark</i></b></p><p>The project the Deputy is referring to on the N71 in Bantry is known as &quot;the Bantry to Dunnamark route&quot; project. Resurfacing at this location is being progressed through design, to tender, by Cork County Council as the relevant local road authority and contracting party. I would, in the normal course of events, expect the scheme to be carried out next year on this basis. </p><p>However, at this location, there is an interaction with works planned by Irish Water, which would have an impact on the delivery of these works and on the road surface. In the event that this delays progress on the scheme, Transport infrastructure Ireland and Cork County Council are also currently looking at short-term remedial measures, which could proceed in the near term in advance of more substantial resurfacing works.</p><p><b><i>Pavement Schemes Programme 2020</i></b></p><p>I wold note that this project is only one of a number of road resurfacing schemes along the N71 under TII&rsquo;s Pavement Schemes Programme in recent years, including:</p><p>- N71 Seafield to Knockroe Pavement Repairs (previously Parkana to Knockroe extended)</p><p>- N71 Lissalane to Gillanes</p><p>- N71 Derry</p><p>- N71 Canrooska</p><p>- N71 Leap to Dromahilly</p><p>Currently, the following N71 resurfacing schemes are being progressed through design, to tender, by Cork County Council:</p><p>- N71 Bantry to Dunnamark</p><p>- N71 Glaslinn Road</p><p>- N71 Glengarriff</p><p><b><i>Safety Schemes </i></b></p><p>TII has also provided my Department with an update on the current status of a number of Safety Schemes on the N71 route, such as:</p><p>- Rosscarbery Pedestrian Crossing &ndash; in progress</p><p>- Gaggin Junction &ndash; in progress</p><p>- Ballinvoultig safety improvements &ndash; ongoing</p><p>- Bantry West approach &ndash; Feasibility report underway</p><p>- Bantry North approach &ndash; Feasibility report underway</p><p>- Leap footpath &ndash; Feasibility report underway</p><p>- Glengarriff footpath &ndash; Feasibility report underway</p><p><b><i>Outline of current projects on the route</i></b></p><p>TII has provided my Department with information on two new schemes that are currently relevant to the route.</p><p><i>Bandon Bypass Extension:</i></p><p>A feasibility study was completed by Cork County Council. A scheme Project Appraisal Plan (PAP) has also been prepared and approved by the Department of Transport.</p><p>Currently the N71 Relief Road around Bandon ties back into the existing road network via a very steep downhill gradient.  Traffic also needs to negotiate a number of roundabouts and priority junctions within the built up area of Bandon.

I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.</p>  <p>  In relation to Galway, I understand there are a variety of proposals as to how public transport corridors could be served including the possibility of bus rapid transport corridors that share many of the characteristics of light rail systems and could, at a later date, be upgraded to light rail.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Galway aims to deliver a rationalised network of five high-performing cross-city routes. All routes will serve major city centre attractions as well as linking all major destinations across the city. It will also comprise next generation bus lanes, enhanced services, cashless fares and account-based ticketing and a transition to low emission and zero emission vehicles.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with Galway-based stakeholders who had an interest in a new light rail technology emerging in the UK, and there may indeed be merit in that technology at some point in the future.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that consultations are currently underway in relation to the Cross-City Corridor and the Dublin Road Corridor which together have a really important role in delivering bus and active travel improvements from east to west across the city and want to see both progress to planning and construction as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These initial exemptions were detailed in IAA Aeronautical Notices P30 and P33 which pertained to the adoption of exemption measures aimed at extending the validity period of ratings, certificates and medical reports, as applicable, for flight crews, cabin crews, instructors and examiners, mechanics, air traffic controllers and aeromedical examiners. The exemptions from the EU regulations applied to operations taking place within a reference period between 1 March and 31 October 2020 and for a maximum period of eight months. Currently, the IAA is addressing any further exemption requests from pilots on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  The Government has  made a significant level of Exchequer support available for the aviation sector. Many aviation companies continue to benefit from the economy-wide support measures that the Government put in place right from the very beginning of the pandemic, such as the the wage subsidy scheme, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Liquidity support has been made available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 the Government made provision for &euro;10m for Cork and Shannon airports while confirming a commitment of &euro;21m under the Regional Airports Programme to support Knock, Kerry and Donegal airports. </p>  <p>  In addition to the general COVID-19 supports and targeted aviation funding committed to in Budget 2021, The Government has agreed an &euro;80 million funding package for aviation in recognition of the difficult winter faced by the sector and to support the retention of core connectivity. This includes operational and capital funding for airports and an Airport Charges Rebate Scheme for January to March 2021, subject to State Aid approval of the European Commission.</p></reply>

Since 2018, detailed work has been underway across Government, led by the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, to invest in the infrastructure, systems, and staffing required for additional checks and controls for trade with Great Britain at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the OPW that the current works in Dublin Port are continuing and that handover of additional facilities will commence in the next fortnight.  </p>  <p>  Once again, I am advised by the OPW that when finished, it is expected that the facilities will meet all the requirements of the relevant State agencies. Undoubtedly the additional regulatory controls required post transition will mean that a proportion of traffic will remain within the port for a longer period that has been the case to date. However, the aim of all the State Agencies and the Dublin Port Company is to ensure minimal disruption to the ongoing operations at the Port.  </p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that Dublin Port Company has made lands available to State services with an area of 14.6 hectares.  This is approximately 6% of the total land area of Dublin Port.  Dublin Port Company has advised that this loss does not have a significant immediate impact on the day to day operations of the port but it does have implications for the future provision of additional capacity.</p>  <p>  In a situation where Dublin Port Company is developing Dublin Port to reach its ultimate capacity by 2040, the loss of large areas of port land as a result of Brexit creates a challenge to accommodate anticipated future growth. That being said, Dublin Port Company will continue to work with the OPW to manage land use as the new trading arrangements and border inspection services bed in.  </p>  <p>  In light of the potential for Brexit-related traffic congestion at the Port to impact on adjacent roads, the Port Tunnel, and the motorway system a Traffic Management Group, chaired by the Department of Transport and including representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), Dublin City Council (DCC), An Garda Sioch&aacute;na (AGS), OPW, Revenue Commissioners and Dublin Port Company (DPC) was established. The Groups&rsquo; remit was to consider the potential knock-on impacts on city traffic management originally in a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  This Traffic Management Group had developed a no-deal contingency plan which defined the roles of the various agencies and the associated communications strategy and operational plan outlining the options and actions required to mitigate impacts on the road network. </p>  <p>  This plan is now being updated to take into account developments that have occurred in the intervening period and details of the Plan will be published when completed.</p></reply>

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Act 1993- 2015, the planning design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the National Roads Programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan (NDP).</p><p>In that context, TII provides my Department with regular updates on its delivery of the National Roads Programme. </p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the National Planning Framework. This provides the strategic and financial framework for TII's national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government, the Government has recently commenced a review of the NDP. As part of this review, the Minister for Public Expendture and Reform launched a public consultation on 3<sup>rd</sup>November, providing interested parties with the opportunity to input to the process. Taking account of feedback received, a revised NDP is planned to be published by Summer 2021, setting out a capital investment envelope for infrastructure to 2030.</p><p><b>N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom</b></p><p><i>Project outline</i></p><p>This new road development, currently under construction, consists of a 22km upgrade of the N22 National Primary Route from Ballyvourney to Macroom to a dual carriageway standard.  This will comprise a bypass of Macroom Town and the villages of Ballyvourney and Ballymakeera, Co Cork. This scheme is on the TEN-T Comprehensive route and will strengthen the link between Cork and Kerry.</p><p><i>Current status</i></p><p>The previous Government approved the award of the construction contract in October 2019 and construction on site commenced in December 2019, with a cost estimate of circa &euro;280 million. Good progress on construction is currently being made and it is expected that the dual carriageway will be operational in 2023.</p><p><b>N22 Farranfore to Killarney</b></p><p><i>Project outline</i></p><p>This scheme consists of 27km of road improvement between Farranfore and Killarney along the N22. The scheme provides for a bypass of Farranfore village, a new realigned N22 including a link into Killarney town and an outer bypass of Killarney town.</p><p><i>Current status</i></p><p>The Pre-Appraisal Plan (PAP) was approved by my Department in December 2018. However, Kerry County Council revisited the PAP to include an additional link on the N71 Muckross Road and the PAP was resubmitted to the Department. This was approved by my Department in October 2019 and Kerry County Council have procured and awarded the Technical Advisor contract for the scheme and the scheme is progressing through planning and design. </p><p>As the project is in the early stage of planning, it is not yet possible to provide an accurate estimate of the total cost. The progression of the scheme is dependent on the availability of funding and statutory approval. The timeframe for delivery of any major or minor works/projects that require statutory approval, including in relation to an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) or Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) or both, is between 8 to 13 years.</p></reply>

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network.  Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  </p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times for essential purposes doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p><p>The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, in light of the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the COVID-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services. </p><p>The NTA issued a statement on their website on 20 October 2020 which says that they will look at &ldquo;particular pressure points&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level.  Both the Department of Transport and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. </p><p><b><i>Aviation</i></b></p><p><b><i>Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of COVID-19</i></b></p><p>The &ldquo;Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of COVID-19&rdquo; was published by the Department of Transport, in consultation with the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee, which includes representatives of the aviation industry, regulators, border control and public health authorities. The Protocol, published on 21 July 2020 and updated in October, is guidance for the coordinated implementation of EASA/ECDC &ndash; &ldquo;COVID-19 Aviation Health Safety Protocol &ndash; operational Guidelines for the Management of airline passengers in relation to COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo; (AHSP) (30, June Issue 2). The protocol has due regard to the EASA/ECDC COVID-19 Aviation Health Protocol Guidelines and national guidance in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has taken a pro-active role in promoting and ensuring that airports and airlines operate the guidelines contained in the AHSP. In addition to the AHSP, the IAA has written to each Irish airline and airport encouraging each one to participate in the EASA industry Charter for COVID-19. The Charter establishes a feedback loop from industry directly to EASA on the performance of the measures implemented, to fine-tune and improve the guidance in the light of operational experience and of the expected increase in traffic volumes. A number of Irish airlines and airports have already joined. EASA are performing an overall monitoring role in Europe and are using the information collected from multiple sources, including the charter participants, to identify areas where the protocols outlined may be ineffective or can be further improved. As such, the AHSP is a living document and the IAA expects ECDC/EASA to publish a further revision in the coming weeks.</p><p>The <b>Passenger Locator</b>form, administered by the Department of Health, remains in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the &quot;colour&quot; of the location they are arriving from.  Essential transport workers continue to be exempt from completing the form.  The introduction of an online form supports an enhanced system of engagements with arriving passengers. The main purpose of the form is for the targeting of key public health messages to arriving passengers through SMS and email.</p><p><b><i>Testing/EU Traffic Light System</i></b></p><p>The Government has developed a framework around the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system, which was adopted at EU level on 13 October.  As part of this, people arriving into Ireland from EU green regions do not have to restrict their movement for 14 days. All other passengers must continue to restrict their movements for 14 days unless they are exempted essential workers. The Government also aligned with the updated list of exempted categories of traveller with essential function or need within the EU recommendation.</p><p>The requirement for those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived, if they have a negative COVID-19 test result from a test taken up to three days before arrival. </p><p>From midnight 29<sup>th</sup>November, arrivals from an EU red region will not be expected to restrict movements following receipt of a negative/not-detected result from a COVID-19 PCR test taken <i>a minimum of five days after arrival</i>in Ireland. This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. </p><p>There are a number of COVID-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review. </p><p>Testing provision under Ireland&rsquo;s framework for international travel will not be provided through the public health system, but rather will be met by the private commercial sector testing supply on a user pays basis.  As the availability of testing cannot be guaranteed intending passengers wishing to avail of a test should seek an early appointment for a test in advance of travel.</p><p><b><i>Maritime</i></b></p><p>It is recognised that maritime transport plays a crucial role in the supply chain, particularly to an island nation such as Ireland.  It is essential to the continued supply of goods in and out of the country, accounting as it does, for 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s international trade in volume terms. For this reason, ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s ports, shipping operations and all the elements of that maritime supply chain continue to function is vitally important. </p><p>My Department has engaged regularly throughout the pandemic with key stakeholders in the maritime sector and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that the maritime sector has continued to operate across all levels of the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan. This is exemplified by the fact that not only have the majority of scheduled sailings into and out of Ireland continued during COVID-19 but a range of new services have been added in recent months, thus enabling the supply of goods and the carriage of essential workers to critical jobs along with the repatriation of citizens.</p><p>My Department is also continuing, with the assistance of the IMDO to monitor and assess market conditions and trends on a weekly basis.  </p><p>In addition to meeting regularly with key stakeholders in maritime to address COVID-19 issues, a number of key guidance documents have been published to ensure the sector has access to the most up-to-date information and advice.  </p><p>- The COVID-19 Agreed Protocol for International Ro-Ro Passenger Transport Services, Ports &amp;amp; Terminal Service Operators was published in July. The Protocol, which was developed in collaboration with relevant stakeholders aims to ensure a broadly consistent approach to the facilitation by maritime transport providers of a safe and gradual restoration of maritime passenger transport as countries lift travel restrictions.</p><p>- To assist stakeholders and the public with issues that may arise as a result of COVID-19, my Department developed a Frequently Asked Questions guide on COVID-19 related issues in the Maritime Sector. This guide is updated regularly as required.</p><p>A series of Marine Notices were also published on Gov.ie and circulated to a mailing list of almost 700 recipients. These Marine Notices provided information on the following: </p><p>- Marine Notice No. 14 of 2020 sets out the temporary measures being put in place in relation to the validity of seafarers&rsquo; documents impacted as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p><p>- Marine Notice No. 06 of 2020 provides instructions from the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the submission of Maritime Declarations of Health.</p><p>- Marine Notice No. 15 of 2020 sets out temporary provisions for survey and certification of Irish ships.</p><p>- Marine Notice No. 16 of 2020 sets out  the  measures  that have been taken to date to protect the maritime transport supply chain, guidance that has issued to supply chain workers and other COVID-19 related updates in the maritime sector.</p><p>- Marine Notice No.  22 of 2020 provides details of the Passenger Locator Form. </p><p>- Marine Notice No. 32 of 2020 reminds domestic passenger vessels of the latest COVID-19 guidance issued.  </p><p>Furthermore, my Department has made arrangements to continue with the training of seafarers at the National Maritime College of Ireland by facilitating on-line examinations as well as online delivery of lectures for students at the college. Similar provisions are being made with Bord Iascaigh Mhara at the National Fisheries Colleges at Greencastle, Co. Donegal and Castletownbere, Co. Cork. In addition my Department has engaged with the National Maritime College of Ireland regarding proposed changes to online delivery to some seafarers' training courses currently approved by the Department.<b></b>Additionally, the MSO has continued with face-to-face oral examinations of officers for their qualifying examinations for certificates of competency. The MSO has also made arrangements with the owners of new fishing vessels and tourist vessels which are being built overseas to ensure the on-going statutory certification of such vessels.</p><p>Thus through regular engagement with maritime stakeholders it has been possible to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 in a timely and effective manner and ensure that maritime the sector remains operational.</p><p><b><i>Road Haulage</i></b></p><p>I wish to fully acknowledge the essential role of road transport operators and HGV drivers and the challenges facing the industry both in the context of COVID-19 and Brexit. </p><p>A number of measures have been implemented to date to support the road haulage sector.

Under this dual mandate, the IAA also regulates some of its own commercial functions.  Government policy is to decouple these two roles, and as part of this reform initiative I have had engagement with the Authority. In addition my Department has ongoing engagement with IAA in relation to corporate governance and policy matters including, for example, the response to the Covid 19 crisis and Brexit.   </p>  <p>  Under planned structural reforms, the existing for-profit air navigation services will be separated out as a standalone commercial semi-State body, while the Commission for Aviation Regulation&rsquo;s economic and consumer affairs responsibilities will be merged with the IAA&rsquo;s remaining safety and security regulation functions.  The result will be a strong, single aviation regulator overseeing all aspects of Irish aviation. This newly reformed IAA will provide a single point of contact for all of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation regulatory requirements &ndash; for consumers, the traveling public and industry.  Draft legislation to give legal effect to these institutional reforms is being finalised, which I hope to publish soon, and the Authority is hiring a new Chief Regulator following an international recruitment process run by the Public Appointment Service.  The new Regulator will take up the position on January 1, 2021.  </p>  <p>  As to how the present Covid pandemic has impacted the IAA, the collapse in air traffic has had a detrimental impact on its for-profit revenue streams coming from air traffic services.  Also, in its role as regulator of aviation safety and security within the State it has had to adjust to the public health disruption caused by Covid and the operational challenges that this brings to all sectors of our society at this time. However, it is important to note that both sets of challenges are being managed.</p>  <p>  On the matter of the EASA/ECDC Covid-19 Health Safety Protocols, these provide important and coordinated guidance on measures to protect public health arising from air travel.  Drawing from this guidance, my Department has produced a national &ldquo;Protocol for the management of air passengers in light of Covid-19,&rdquo; which sets out a number of important measures covering the end-to-end passenger journey.   It is important to understand that the EASA/ECDC Protocols, and the National Protocols that flow from these, are subject to regular review to ensure that they are up to date with developments.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has indicated a preference for greater harmonisation and coordination of the EU approach to international travel. It recently requested  EASA/ECDC is to develop a a proposal for a common EU approach to testing for COVID 19 to facilitate international travel. I expect that this proposal will be put forward by EASA/ECDC in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened.  Following experience of managing the tests under Covid restrictions, this was increased to six in mid-September. </p>  <p>  My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints.</p></reply>

The legislation requires the NTA to review its 20-year <i>Strategy</i>every six years to allow for consideration of changed, or changing, circumstances. </p><p>I very much welcome this approach toward strategic transport planning and believe it allows for a whole-of-system review of transport needs considered within the broader context of population, employment and spatial trends. It is vitally important that we consider our transport requirements on a systemic level rather than focussing purely on one particular mode or another. </p><p>The <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 </i>was developed by the NTA a few years ago and, in line with its statutory obligations, the NTA has now commenced preparatory work on a review of the <i>Strategy</i>; that review will include consideration of possible future metro lines such as those referred to by the Deputies. The review will include a comprehensive analysis of changes to population projections, development density, employment forecasts and future travel demand patterns since the finalisation of the current strategy.  This analysis will be utilized to reassess the public transport needs across the city and will include the evaluation of bus, light rail and metro options. </p><p>The review will be subject to a full public consultation, including the publication of all background reports and feasibility studies and that public consultation will take place next year. </p></reply>

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   </p>  <p>  The Government's new "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels;  including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  </p>  <p>  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  </p>  <p>  Since the move to level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.</p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation will ease the situation, it remains the case that there will still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. </p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.</p></reply>

When the service resumed in June, there was an increased level of demand and a significant backlog developed. This was coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements. </p>  <p>  When the Driver Theory Test Service  closed on the 21st of October due to the latest restrictions, the majority of testing centres had almost full bookings up to end December and some into January too as it worked its way through the initial backlog. The decision was taken by the service provider that those whose appointments were cancelled due to the latest restrictions would be rescheduled to the next available appointment date. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services are resumed. This will help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. </p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

However, quantitative controls on the SPSV industry have not been exercised by Government for nearly two decades. Prior to the abolition of those controls the country, and Dublin in particular, suffered from a chronic undersupply of taxis. The abolition of those controls was necessary to address these supply issues and over the past two decades this policy has served passengers well. As I do not believe passenger interests would be served by the reintroduction of quantitative controls, I do not favour imposing a moratorium on the issuance of SPSV licences at this time. In any event at the moment demand for new taxi licences is very low and I understand current application levels are a fraction of previous application levels. It is therefore unclear how preventing new applications would deliver any benefit to existing operators.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to dissolve the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, sometimes known as the Taxi Advisory Committee. This is because the Committee has played an important role in advising my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) on the issues facing the industry and on how to assist it through the pandemic and ensure its future sustainability. In July, the Committee submitted a report with a number of recommendations to support the industry. The report and its recommendations formed the basis of useful engagement across Government and I am pleased that many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, such as a waiver of vehicle licensing fees for 2021, have been implemented.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee, which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests, and official stakeholders such as local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This diversity of representation, combined with members' commitment to having a well-functioning and effective SPSV sector, is a real strength of the Committee.  Accordingly, the Advisory Committee has been and will remain the central focus for my engagement with the SPSV sector in relation to issues affecting the sector, including the impact of COVID-19. I made my views clear on this issue when I met with taxi representatives last week. I also noted that there are a number of vacancies of the Committee which could be filled by SPSV driver representatives and I encouraged the representatives to consider applying for these vacancies.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will of course continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.</p></reply>

I very much welcome the development of these transport strategies to guide transport investment and the delivery of transport infrastructure in all the major cities. This move toward evidence based, plan-led transport planning for our major cities allows for consideration of the issues highlighted by the Deputy and the potential role all modes of transport can play in addressing them. I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.</p><p>Obviously all strategies and plans produced by agencies must comply with relevant Government policy. In that regard, it is important to understand the fundamental role of transport strategies in setting out the infrastructure requirements needed in metropolitan areas to enable significant modal shift in line with overarching Government policy.</p><p>However, what transport strategies cannot do is make people use the infrastructure or assume that all people will simply switch to using the new and improved infrastructure. The issue of behavioural change is complex and, internationally, is recognised as an issue which requires considerable time to influence and significantly change in any meaningful way.</p><p>This interplay between infrastructure requirements and behavioural change can influence perspectives on the positive potential of transport strategies. As an example the draft transport strategy for the Deputy&rsquo;s own city of Limerick proposes a cycling network capable of facilitating 33,000 cyclists per hour travelling to/from the city centre on vastly improved cycling infrastructure. The Deputy will acknowledge that this level of cycling in Limerick would represent an utterly transformed scenario than the current levels of cycling within the city today. </p><p>The Deputy can be assured that all of Government is committed to achieving the fundamental change in transport required in the coming years and I believe that the metropolitan area transport strategies, and their integration with relevant land-use plans, will have an important role to play in that regard.</p></reply>

It is my view that we need to shift our current focus on greenways as primarily tourism and leisure orientated facilities, and instead consider how they can act as facilitators of active travel in their local communities and link people with local shops, schools and workplaces. </p><p>As well as that, I am also keen to ensure that local authorities across the country - and not just the five main cities - can access multi-annual funding to deliver improved active travel infrastructure in towns and villages. As the Deputy is aware, the new <i>Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future </i>sets out an ambitious and wide-ranging set of commitments in relation to walking and cycling, supported by an increased multi-annual budgetary allocation amounting to some &euro;1.8 billion over the lifetime of the Government. </p><p>I am determined that an element of this increased funding will be made available to local authorities outside of the five cities and would hope that this year&rsquo;s allocations under the July Stimulus demonstrated my intent in this regard. </p><p>Next year, local authorities will be able to access funding to help develop active travel network plans to assist with the roll-out of infrastructure in the years ahead, and they will also be able to apply for funding to deliver improved infrastructure next year. Details of this funding package will be made available shortly and I very much look forward to working with local authorities as we look to deliver fundamental change to the nature of transport across Ireland.</p></reply>

The imperative to do the theory test within a period of 6 weeks at Level 5 is therefore limited.

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government in 2021. This will involve identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general.

The NTA has taken action since the start of the pandemic to alleviate the operating costs of drivers. The Government's "Stimulus" announcment in July contained several measures that can be availed of by self-employed individuals including SPSV operators. These included a number of investment and liquidity measures as well as the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant. The recent Budget contained further measures, including a new &euro;15 million scrappage scheme for operators of older SPSVs, a waiver of vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021, and a new income disregard for self-employed Pandemic Unemployment Payment recipients, allowing them to earn up to &euro;480 monthly before tax but after expenses such as insurance. I understand that the NTA has also proposed a further extension of vehicle age limits and that consultation on this proposal is now underway.</p></reply>

Airports and airlines have been able to avail of some of those measures, in particular employment supports, rates waivers and deferred taxes. Cork Airport, an autonomous business unit within the daa, is availing of these supports.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures the Government made a specific provision of &euro;10m for Cork and Shannon airports in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  Most significantly however, in recent days the Government has agreed a revised &euro;80m funding package for Irish aviation.  In recognition of the very difficult winter season being faced by the aviation sector the Government has decided to provide more supports, in addition to those announced in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The funding package will include an Airport Charges Rebate Scheme for January to March 2021, subject to State Aid approval from the EU Commission. This is one of the recommendations made by the Task Force for Aviation Recovery and, at an estimated cost of &euro;20m, will support the retention of core connectivity through the Winter season.</p>  <p>  The Government has also decided to provide further operational and capital funding supports of &euro;22m for Cork and Shannon Airports, which is in addition to the &euro;10m in capital funding announced in Budget 2021.  Airports generally as well as the airlines will of course continue will to benefit from the economy-wide support measures that are open to all sectors. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming National Economic Plan will provide for any further appropriate measures to safeguard strategic regional connectivity and the resilience of the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  This level of unprecedented supports for Cork and our other airports is a clear manifestation of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.</p></reply>

I believe, however, that these costs are not particularly high when measured against the cost of running a car in the long term. Nor is the cost of taking the driving test itself unreasonable when held against the considerable cost to the authorities concerned to provide the service. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport I have no direct control over the fees charged by individual driving schools and instructors.  Driving schools are private businesses and neither my Department nor the Road Safety Authority can dictate to driving schools on how they should run their business or set their fees.</p>  <p>  Insurance companies are also private companies who enter into private contracts with their customers and I remind the Deputy that EU rules specifically prohibit member states from interfering in the terms and conditions offered by these companies. I understand that insurance companies use more than 50 criteria to price a policy, but different companies apply different weightings to the various criteria. I would encourage learner drivers to shop around to get the best deal for their particular circumstances. It has been brought to my attention, for example, that at least one insurance company offers learners a package of 6 months car insurance plus the 12 required lessons under a single price.</p></reply>

It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector. </p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant State aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of the year and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment.  </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also been tasked with developing a Business Continuity Scheme to help coach tourism businesses through this very difficult period. This scheme, which has been allocated &euro;10m in funding as part of the July stimulus package, is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors. Indeed, the travel trade has not been able to reclaim any meaningful level of lost trade over the past 6 months.  My colleague Minister of State Naughton met with the travel trade industry  as represented by the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) and our Department has maintained contact with the ITAA throughout this crisis. </p>  <p>  I understand that, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  This scheme is designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted or temporarily closed as a result of the restrictions as set out in the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with COVID-19&rsquo; Plan. Detailed guidance on this scheme (which is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe) is available at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/budget-information/2021/crss-guidelines.pdf. </p>  <p>  Taken together with the various supports made available by Government for SMEs, I would be hopeful that these various measures will help safeguard the travel trade sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.</p></reply>

I have no doubt that at the heart of that transport strategy will be ambitious plans for much improved active travel infrastructure across the city, making it easier and safer than ever to walk and cycle across the city. I also expect the new <i>Strategy</i>will look to complement the development of the new integrated transport hub at the North Quays, as to be funded by the URDF, and build on the investments made in the city's public transport last year with the overhaul of the city&rsquo;s bus network and introduction of new bus fleet.</p></reply>

Under that Scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the criteria set out in the Act.  A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases. </p>  <p>  Up to 2012 my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme. However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the post 2008 financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop providing dedicated funding for LIS in 2012 and there was no funding for LIS in that year.</p>  <p>  After that from 2013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme, local authorities could use a proportion of their Discretionary grant for the Local Improvement Scheme if they chose to do so. The reason for this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme for non-public roads.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, my colleague the Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for the LIS and is continuing to fund the scheme.  In light of the significant funding being put into LIS by the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development and the need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of my Department's Discretionary grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Rural and Community Development made an allocation of &euro;10 million available for 2020 for LIS and works under the scheme are nearing completion with full draw down of the 2020 allocation expected by year-end. I also understand that an increase has been secured by that Department in the LIS allocation in Budget 2021. My colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, will be able to further advise the Deputy in relation to the operation of the scheme in 2021.</p></reply>

This will have immediate implications for trade flows, particularly to UK markets but also to wider EU markets via the UK Landbridge. </p>  <p>  All businesses that export goods to Great Britain will be subject to a range of new customs formalities, SPS checks and other regulatory requirements that do not currently apply to such exports. It is vital that all exporters take steps to understand the impacts of the new rules or processes that will govern their export activity from 1 January 2021. These steps are set out in the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan published in September 2020. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan also sets out the detailed work that has been carried out across Government to invest in the infrastructure and systems required for these additional checks and controls for trade with Great Britain in both directions, at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and at Dublin Airport. </p>  <p>  In relation to trade transiting the UK to access EU markets, the UK landbridge is an important means of access to the single market, one that is favoured by traders in high value or time sensitive goods because it offers significantly faster transit times than alternative routes. As such we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic using the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.   </p>  <p>  The process for moving goods by direct ferry routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to the new procedures and controls. This trade stays within the Single Market. Following ongoing consultation with the shipping sector, and given the responsiveness of the shipping companies during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been my Department&rsquo;s assessment that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period.</p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) last week published a report that reassesses Ireland&rsquo;s Maritime Connectivity, and builds on and updates previous work carried out by the IMDO by updating the 2018 Landbridge Study. This report concludes that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum. </p>  <p>  In addition the IMDO have launched a communications campaign which encourages businesses currently moving goods to Continental Europe through the UK to ACT now - ASSESS their supply chain, COMMUNICATE their needs to their logistic or shipping company and TRIAL the direct shipping options in order to keep their business moving. I encourage engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs and I would encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.   </p>  <p>  The performance of the shipping industry in responding to the challenges of Covid-19 has been impressive, including with a number of new direct services to Continental Europe having been established between Irish and continental ports, during the pandemic. My Department is confident that the shipping industry serving Ireland is open and competitive, is responsive to market demand and capable of responding to any increase in demand for direct connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period. Indeed we have seen recent moves by Irish Ferries and Stena to introduce revised schedules from 1 January 2021.  Both companies have indicated that they are changing and increasing their sailings to Cherbourg from January 2021. Between them there will then be a daily service available from Ireland to France resulting in a further increase in capacity on this direct Continental Europe route of approximately 15%.</p>  <p>  As regards air freight, the air cargo sector is fully liberalised and airlines are free to operate on a commercial basis in response to market developments internationally.  Department officials have been working closely with stakeholders in the aviation sector both in response to the imapcts of the COVID-19 crisis, and to prepare them for the changes to come at the end of the Brexit Transition period. Officials from my Department continue to engage on a regular basis with airlines, other aviation stakeholders, and with the European Commission on efforts to maintain essential supply lines, and other related issues.   </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan has a section on air travel with advice to businesses on what steps to take in order to be Brexit ready. This would apply to those involved in air freight, as well as passenger transport. Similar readiness preparations have been made at European level. It is not anticipated that the changed regulatory regime for aviation between the EU and the UK will have any direct impact on the movement of freight by air.</p>  <p>  With a view to keeping essential supply lines moving during the COVID-19 crisis, my Department also fully supported the European Commission in its Green Lanes Communications in March 2020 and again last month, for border management measures across the EU to protect health and ensure the continued availability of goods and essential services.</p></reply>

In that regard it is the position of all stakeholders that the <i>status quo</i>remains in so far as possible and that Irish investors and traders can continue to operate as they have and without any additional and unnecessary friction.</p><p>The Government has put in place a number of legislative supports to assist the migration of the CSD in an orderly and timely manner. </p><p>Part 4 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the operation of a substitute securities settlement system, compatible with the law of the European Union after the transition period.  Specifically on timelines, section 1087G provides for a least a 72-hour period before a general meeting for a relevant issuer to permit investor&rsquo;s voting instructions in a general meeting to be provided.  This is compared to a 48-hour period for PLCs outside of the CSD system and is necessary operationally under the CSD&rsquo;s intermediated system.</p><p>In addition to the provisions of Part 4 this Bill and the Finance Bill 2020, the Government also enacted the Migration of Participating Securities Act 2019 ensuring the orderly migration of all Irish securities to Euroclear Bank. </p><p>The combined effect of these legislative supports is to bring clarity to participants and to mitigate against any potential financial and disruption risks arising from the migration of the system.</p><p>The migration also allows for the operation of the CSD and all trades settled on it to continue to be covered under the EU regulatory framework in this area.</p><p>The wider responsibility for financial services lies with my colleague the Minister for Finance.  I am committed to ensuring the Companies Act 2014 supports the proposed functioning of the securities markets and more broadly Irish business.</p></reply>

The Action Plan includes a range of ambitious, holistic measures to reform and strengthen how we manage our waste. The Plan commits to ensuring that all packaging placed on the market is reusable or recyclable by 2030. This will be achieved through the eco-modulation of extended producer responsibility fees whereby recyclable packaging will have substantially reduced fees, while non-recyclable, composite packaging and over-packaging will attract a heavier fee. </p>  <p>  In the context of food waste, the Plan commits to working with a range of stakeholders to develop a Food Waste Prevention Roadmap. This Roadmap will set out a series of actions to deliver the reductions necessary to halve our food waste by 2030, meet any other related targets, and promote our transition to a circular economy.</p>  <p>  The  Plan acknowledges the role which packaging plays for food hygiene and we commit to work with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on measures relevant to food contact packaging, acknowledging in particular the health and safety requirements.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Plan acknowledges the role of packaging in food preservation with a commitment to support the design and roll out of packaging developed by retailers and the packaging industry that meets the needs of food preservation without encouraging the generation of packaging waste, especially plastic packaging.</p></reply>

This is partly explained by the differing waste collection and recycling infrastructures which exist across the EU. </p>  <p>  The 'Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy', which I launched in September  contains a specific chapter on plastics and packaging waste, which outlines a number of measures to achieve optimum results in reducing packaging waste. The plan confirms that we will work with packaging suppliers to ensure they play their part in reducing primary, secondary and tertiary packaging waste arising and ensuring that all packaging on the market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the European Union (Waste Directive) Regulations 2020 introduced a new requirement for collective Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes to &ldquo;eco&rdquo; modulate the financial contributions paid by producers. The objective of this new provision is to provide an incentive to producers to design products that contribute to waste prevention and facilitate recycling by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and their recyclability. Essentially the more the products comply with these requirements the lesser the fees on the producer. These provisions will be applied in a harmonised fashion across the EU. The Commission are currently developing specific guidelines which will look at recommended modulation criteria including recyclability, reusability and recycled content.</p>  <p>  EPR fee modulation is one of a number of economic instruments that may be used to incentivise more sustainable production and consumption patterns, with a view of developing a circular economy. My overall ambition is to significantly reduce the amount of plastic packaging placed on the Irish market.</p></reply>

The supports include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which will now run into 2021, waiver of commercial rates, tax clawback, and liquidity support available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.  </p><p>It remains open to airlines to engage directly with the relevant agencies concerned with a view to drawing down such supports. The amount of any funding sought by each airline would be a commercial matter for the airlines concerned. </p><p>Budget 2021 provides for &euro;8.5 billion in funding for public services to address the challenges of COVID-19, and a Recovery Fund is also to be established to stimulate demand and employment, and is to be funded to over &euro;3 billion. </p><p>The report of the Aviation Recovery Taskforce contains a number of recommendations relating to the provision of further support to the sector including through stimulus funding to aid recovery, and these recommendations are being considered, as appropriate, in the context of the ongoing work to manage the impact of COVID-19 on aviation and the wider economy. </p><p>This week, the Government agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package for Irish aviation. In recognition of the very difficult winter season being faced by the aviation sector it has decided to provide an extra &euro;48 million in supports for 2021, in addition to those announced in Budget 2021.</p><p>For the smaller regional airports of Knock, Kerry and Donegal, in addition to the &euro;21m in funding available under the Regional Airports Programme for 2021, further operational support of &euro;6m will be made available.</p><p>The funding package will also include an Airport Charges Rebate Scheme for January to March 2021, subject to State Aid approval from the EU Commission. This is one of the recommendations made by the Task Force for Aviation Recovery and, at an estimated cost of &euro;20m, will support the retention of core connectivity through the Winter season.</p><p>To better facilitate international travel, Government has decided to implement the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; classification system which categorises EU Member States/regions inside Member States as red, orange or green, based on the number of cases of COVID-19 present in that respective location. In addition to this, COVID-19 testing will also be considered to further ensure the health and safety of international travellers. Government also agreed that, in accordance with the EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function.</p><p>In relation to airports, more specifically, supports are continuing through the Government&rsquo;s Regional Airports Programme.  This year, the airports of Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock) are eligible to receive capital and operational funding of &euro;6 million.  Stobart Air, along with Donegal and Kerry airports, are also benefitting from the PSO air services that operate between these two airports and Dublin.  Furthermore, in June of this year, the Government approved funding of &euro;6.1m towards a hold baggage screening project at Shannon Airport.</p><p>Budget 2021 is providing &euro;31.3m to regional airports next year, consisting of &euro;21.3m for the Regional Airports Programme (Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West) and &euro;10m in capital funding for Cork and Shannon airports.  These supports will help airports to remain viable as they continue to manage operations alongside COVID.</p><p><b>Travel </b></p><p>The range of Government supports are also available to the travel trade especially those introduced to help the SME sector. Where customers of such a business are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing the business premises in which the business is ordinarily carried on, as may be the case with travel agents under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, the business may qualify for the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) as administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p><b>Public Transport and Taxis</b></p><p>Up to 23<sup>rd</sup>October 2020, the PSO Exchequer allocation to the National Transport Authority (NTA) was &euro;537m, including &euro;12.6m to be allocated to commercial operators under the terms of their temporary contracts with the NTA.</p><p>In Budget 2020, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, &euro;288.667 million was provided for PSO, including approximately &euro;8 million for Local Link rural regular services, which is in addition to &euro;14.896 million provided for Local Link under the Rural Transport Programme (RTP). This was a slight increase on the 2019 allocation.</p><p>It was expected that this subsidy, together with the c.&euro;100 million State payment for Free Travel, would meet the difference between the c.&euro;600 million fare revenues collected annually from passengers, and the costs of actually providing the bus and rail services.  Following extensive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the 2020 PSO allocation was utilised to fund the revenue shortfall arising with PSO and Rural Transport operators as a result of COVID-19.  On 4th June 2020 Government agreed an increase in PSO subvention to enable the normal range of Exchequer-supported public transport services to continue to run for this year.  Continuing to fund the existing PSO system will require up to a further c. &euro;460 million to year end (in addition to the c. &euro;300m already provided).</p><p>The Government approved temporary funding supports of up to &euro;95m on 26<sup>th</sup>June 2020, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months.  The package is restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and is being targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services.  The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering this funding support through contracts established between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p><p>Passenger demand for taxis and SPSV has fallen considerably as a consequence of the restrictions brought about by the necessary public health response. As COVID-19 is a national, prolonged crisis which continues to deeply impact communities, businesses, families and individuals across the country, a national response is required.</p><p>The recently published Budget 2021 contained further measures to aid SPSV operators. The Department will provide funding to the NTA to enable it to waive standard SPSV licence renewal fees in 2021. A &euro;15 million scrappage scheme has also been introduced to encourage operators of older vehicles switch to electric vehicles.</p><p>The trading environment for self-employed individuals remains difficult. Accordingly the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will continue until 1 April 2021. Self-employed recipients, including SPSV drivers, can earn up to &euro;480 per month which still receiving the payment. Furthermore, individuals exiting that payment may avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant is a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. Further details on this and other measures are available from Department of Social Protection. </p><p>These measures build on the supports provided since the start of the pandemic. The NTA took action at the outset of COVID-19 to support the SPSV sector, such as licence extensions, the waiver of late renewal feels, and facilitating the suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licence. The NTA has also extended age limits for vehicles that were due to reach them since March until the end of 2020, and are currently considering extending them further until the end of 2021.</p></reply>

I understand that due to continuing travel restrictions the travel trade industry has not been able to reclaim any meaningful level of lost trade over the past 8 months. </p>  <p>  The travel trade is primarily an SME sector, and as such travels agents and tour operators have access to all of the various business supports made available in the July stimulus package and in last month's Budget.  Budget 2021 contains historic levels of State support for the SME sector in the form of wage supports, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  In addition, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  Any queries in relation to the operation of the CRSS should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners. Taken together, I would be hopeful that these significant measures will help safeguard the travel sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.</p>  <p>  The only meaningful solution, of course, is people booking holidays and overseas trips again.  Recent developments provide a basis to hope that the travel trade will be able to start rebuilding their business and customer base in the New Year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-12a.341.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200061#WRF05200"><p>I recognise that the transport sector has been acutely affected by COVID-19 as public health restrictions have discouraged people from traveling generally. Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators and small coach operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine  and small coach operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for affected businesses, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, available for business whose turnover has fallen 30% and liqudity and investment measures such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Other measures include rates waivers and business advisory supports.</p>  <p>  Many self-employed SPSV operators, including self-employed limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which will remain open to new applicants for the remainder of the year and continue to be paid until April 2021. This is an important lifeline for SPSV operators. Many may have gone back to work as the economy began to reopen only to find that subsequent necessary public health measures have once again supressed passenger demand for their services. The continued accessibility of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Budget has now put in place a number of substantial, sector-specific measures to support and strengthen the  tourism sector. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also been tasked with developing a Business Continuity Scheme to help coach tourism businesses through this very difficult period.  Further details on these measures and this scheme are available from my colleague, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin T.D.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), the industry regulator, also took a number of actions to aid SPSV operators, such as licence extensions and late renewal fee waivers. It has also engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. I remain committed to helping reduce the costs to SPSV operators, including limousine operators, and that is why my Department is providing the necessary funding to the NTA to enable it to waive annual vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021.</p></reply>

This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments. </p>  <p>  The RSA has worked with their providers to create additional capacity needed, while adhering to the return to work protocol includng making additional evening and weekend hours available at many  centres, the recruitment of additional staff, extending its postal service for those who are over 70 years of age, and an online service is available to a certain group of customers who are renewing licences and permits. The introduction of these steps will help ease some of the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres.</p>  <p>  Under Covid19 Level 5 Government restrictions effective from midnight on Wednesday 21 October, for six weeks, applicants can attend an appointment at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) centre provided they are an essential worker involved in the provision of essential services or essential retail outlets. Details on what is included in the list of essential workers and retail outlets is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working to expand the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit applications to enable accessibility online rather than by calling to an office. The necessary legislative amendments to facilitate the online system have been made and the regulations came into effect on the 9th November. The NDLS plans to allow all application types to apply online from this week onwards.  A Public Services Card and a verified MyGovID account will be required to access the online system.</p></reply>

To deliver on this will require a whole-of-system perspective across all modes of transport &ndash; including active travel, bus, and rail.</p>  <p>  As referenced in the Programme for Government there is a commitment to developing, and importantly implementing, transport strategies for all of the major cities, towns and regions. This move toward evidence-based, plan-led strategic infrastructure development is in line with international best practice, allows for better integration of transport planning and land-use planning and is the means to deliver real change in our major cities.  Development of these transport strategies allows for full consideration of the potential for rail services in each metropolitan area. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2035 sets out a hugely ambitious programme of improvements to the DART network which is known as the DART+ Programme and will effectively double the capacity of the rail network in the GDA. In advance of that construction is underway on 41 new carriages for the existing GDA commuter fleet which will expand capacity by around 34% as compared to today.</p>  <p>  In Galway, there are plans to redevelop Ceannt Station, construct new infrastructure around Oranmore Station, while a feasibility study is also currently underway in relation to improving infrastructure on the Athenry to Galway corridor.</p>  <p>  In Cork, the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy was published earlier this year and proposes a significant expansion of the commuter rail network in the Cork metropolitan area. In 2021 these proposals will be further progressed with the development of an implementation study.</p>  <p>  In Waterford Government announced this week funding to develop a new integrated transport hub on the North Quays which will include a relocated Plunkett Station, while in Limerick consultation on the draft Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy recently concluded and submissions are being considered by the NTA, a number of which I understand relate to the potential for expanded commuter rail. </p>  <p>  In relation to intercity services, I can inform the Deputy following a recent Transport Sectoral meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, Minister Nichola Mallon, MLA, and I both agreed that our Departments should further develop draft terms of reference for a proposed study of rail speeds, to ensure the finalised terms of reference take sufficient cognisance of the need for balanced regional development.</p>  <p>  I believe this study will allow for a full consideration of the strategic potential of rail, including the opportunities for high-/higher- speed rail where appropriate.  This will be a significant study and my Department will work with the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland to finalise the terms of reference to allow for the procurement process commence and I look forward to the commence of the study in due course.</p></reply>

My Department is also in regular contact with these organisations on these matters. </p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations, the end of the transition period will see the UK no longer applying the rules of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union. This will have immediate implications for trade flows, particularly to UK markets but also to wider EU markets via the UK Landbridge. </p>  <p>  Maintaining transport connectivity to support the movement of goods into and out of Ireland has remained a primary objective of Government during the current crisis, and this will continue to be the case as we near the end of the Brexit transition period.  </p>  <p>  The UK landbridge is an important means of access to the single market for Irish exporters and importers, one that is favoured by traders in high value or time sensitive goods because it offers significantly faster transit times than alternative routes. As such we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic using the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.  This is outside of our control.</p>  <p>  That being said, the process for moving goods by direct ferry routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to the new procedures and controls as this trade stays within the Single Market. </p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) last week published a report that reassesses Ireland&rsquo;s Maritime Connectivity, and builds on and updates previous work carried out by the IMDO by updating the 2018 Landbridge Study. This report concludes that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum. </p>  <p>  For this reason the Government is advocating engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs and I would encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.  In support of this, my Department together with the IMDO have launched a communications campaign which encourages businesses currently moving goods to Continental Europe through the UK to ACT now - ASSESS their supply chain, COMMUNICATE their needs to their logistic or shipping company and TRIAL the direct shipping options in order to keep their business moving. </p>  <p>  As regards air freight, the air cargo sector is fully liberalised and airlines are free to operate on a commercial basis in response to market developments internationally. Officials from my Department continue to engage on a regular basis with airlines, other aviation stakeholders, and with the European Commission on efforts to maintain essential supply lines, and other related issues.</p>  <p>  It is not anticipated that the changed regulatory regime for aviation between the EU and the UK will have any direct impact on the movement of freight by air.</p></reply>

It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large scale return to air travel, but I am committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.  </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed a revised &euro;80m funding package for Irish aviation. In recognition of the very difficult winter season being faced by the aviation sector the Government has decided to provide more supports, in addition to those announced in Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  To better facilitate international travel, Government has also decided to implement the EU &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; classification system which categorises EU Member States and regions inside Member States as red, orange or green, based on the number of cases of COVID-19 present in that respective location. Government also agreed that, in accordance with an EU Recommendation, travellers with an essential function or need should not be required to undergo restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function.</p>  <p>  Government&rsquo;s priority remains to best protect the health and safety of all those living in Ireland.</p></reply>

We are seeking an agreement on aviation which protects Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity to and through the UK and which allows for flexibility in commercial operations. </p>  <p>  Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, the end of the Brexit transition period will bring changes compared with today and certain actions must be taken now to prepare for that change. </p>  <p>  On 9 September, the Government published an updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan. This Plan supports and promotes the necessary preparations for the end of the transition period. The plan includes a section on aviation with advice to stakeholders on what they should do to be ready for the changes to come. This readiness work is being supported by a major national communications campaign under the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; brand. In addition, officials in my Department remain in close contact with aviation stakeholders to support their Brexit readiness.</p>  <p>  The daa has been working on facilities and signage for passengers arriving from the UK into Dublin and Cork airports, and the OPW, along with several other Departments, has installed a Border Control Post in Dublin Airport so that goods, such as agricultural and medical, arriving from the UK can be checked and cleared by Customs, Health and Veterinary officials. </p>  <p>  As regards planning for the longer term,  my Department had commenced scoping work on a revised National Aviation Policy.  However, Covid-19 has fundamentally changed the aviation landscape. Significant uncertainty remains on how long the pandemic will last and when aviation might return to pre-Covid-19 levels. The National Aviation Policy will be revisited in the future once the Covid-19 recovery picture is clearer.</p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The CRSS was announced on Budget day and the operational details are being worked though as quickly as possible.  The scheme will be implemented by the Revenue Commissioners who have shown as an organisation that they are very effective in operating schemes to support businesses in this crisis. Revenue have been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and claims will be accepted from mid-November with payments made shortly thereafter.</p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an outside caterer or an events company, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.</p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  </p><p>I would also point out that the CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b></b>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support  particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Businesses may also be able to benefit from the Live Performance Support Scheme details of which are available at www.gov.ie/en/service/08aff-live-performance-support-scheme/. </p></reply>

These include Debit Card, Credit Card, Annual Debit Instruction (ADI), monthly Direct Debit (DD) through a financial institution, Deduction at Source (DaS) from salary, pension, or certain social welfare payments, and approved service providers including, An Post, Omnivend and Payzone.</p><p>While Revenue does not charge transaction fees for the payment options it directly provides, the approved service providers, who are commercial operations, do levy charges over which Revenue has no control. For example, An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction, Omnivend charges 4% of the transaction and Payzone charges between 75c to &euro;2 depending on the transaction value. Further details regarding the available payment options for LPT are available at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/index.aspx.</p><p>Revenue has advised me that the property owner in question did not receive a Direct Debit mandate for his 2021 LPT payment because he changed his payment option to Debit Card in 2020. The person can still select any of the other available payment options for 2021, including Direct Debit should he choose to do so. He can complete this change through his online account at:  or alternatively he can contact the LPT Helpline at telephone number at 01-7383626, who will assist him to complete the change.</p></reply>

Having said that, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  </p><p>In this respect, I am aware that earlier this year a company active in the Irish market ceased offering commercial liability insurance, and that this decision would have impacted certain private nursing homes.  Unfortunately, the Government cannot compel insurers to provide insurance products that they, for commercial reasons, have chosen to discontinue.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to prioritise reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public, and employer liability insurance. This insurance reform agenda will be driven by the recently established Insurance Reform Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste. This Sub-Group also includes Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy, Fleming and myself, as standing members. I strongly believe that this Sub-Group provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance through a cross-Governmental response.  It has recently met and is currently developing an action plan of key deliverables in line with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Work is also underway in relation to increasing market transparency, including through the planned expansion of the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance; reviewing duty of care legislation; providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent <i>Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions</i>, with a view to presenting options for progressing this by the end of the year; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and making proposals on increasing competition in the Irish insurance market.  It is my hope that the Sub-Group should be able to report on progress in relation to these before the end of the year.  </p><p>In addition to this work, there has been a fresh round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform, the State Claims Agency, Insurance Ireland, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, the Central Bank of Ireland, and Brokers Ireland.  More recently, he has also commenced a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market.  It is also his intention to meet shortly with the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland.</p><p>In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that seeking to secure sustainable competition through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and I will play a lead role to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.  Finally, for nursing homes that have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance, Insurance Ireland operates an Insurance Information Service, which may be of assistance and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

As an individual&rsquo;s income increases they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax paid also increases. Total income tax receipts account for around 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual tax receipts, thereby making a significant contribution towards the cost of the various Exchequer funded State services, many of which are experiencing additional pressures at this time on account of the crisis we are facing as a result of the necessary response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The Government greatly appreciates the additional efforts of essential workers, front line staff and all those working during this difficult time. They are making a key contribution to the State-wide response to the COVID-19 crisis.  Rather than waiving tax payments or introducing a tax relief for those who are working at this time, resources are being focused on new initiatives to support those who are no longer in employment or who will have reduced income in the coming weeks and months, as well as measures seeking to support employers in retaining staff and restarting businesses.</p></reply>

As regards employer eligibility for the EWSS scheme, an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 July and 31 December 2020 as compared to the corresponding 2019 period as a result of the disruption to business caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Additionally, and unlike TWSS, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.</p>  <p>  As part of the measures introduced to assist businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government introduced the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme to support private and voluntary nursing homes with additional costs due to Covid-19.  Where such a support is paid by the HSE, this would be considered an income support and required to be included in turnover when assessing eligibility for either the TWSS or EWSS.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that there was or is no restriction on nursing homes availing of the TWSS or EWSS, assuming they meet the criteria of the scheme in the same manner as any other employer from any sector.</p></reply>

This correspondence  requested, pursuant to section 7(B) sub-section 4 of the 2019 European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations, certain items of further information that are required to complete the process. My Office, working together with Cork City Council and environmental consultants appointed for this project, provided the information to the Department by the deadline on  30th October 2020. If, following review of this supplementary information, as statutorily required, the scheme is deemed to be compliant with all relevant environmental directives and regulations, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform will then be in a position to formally consent to the scheme at Glashaboy.</p>  <p>  The procurement and appointment of a Contractor will be progressed for this scheme following formal Ministerial Confirmation.  The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period National Development Plan 2018-2027. Provision for the cost of the Scheme is included in the Office of Public Works' multi annual capital allocation.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works is committed to funding this project and attends monthly steering meetings to offer every assistance to Cork City Council to ensure a contractor is engaged, and the works commences, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/guidelines/wind-energy/public-consultation-revised-wind-energy-development-guidelines.</p>  <p>  The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), is currently analysing the submissions received. </p>  <p>  Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. The Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The Act requires, inter alia, that there is at least 400 cubic feet of free air space for each person in a bedroom. Local Authorities are responsible for the enforcement of this legislation. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, a local authority can prohibit the use of an overcrowded dwelling, irrespective of whether it is being let or not, and can serve notice on the owner of a dwelling specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy it without causing overcrowding.  If the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, the authority can require the owner to desist from this within a period not exceeding 21 days. Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 and/or to imprisonment for up to one month.</p>  <p>  Overcrowding may give rise to concerns in respect of fire safety, and may lead to enforcement action by fire authorities.</p></reply>

My Department oversees national social housing delivery at programme and scheme level and does not hold specific details in relation to individual dwellings built in accordance with universal design principles. </p><p>Social housing is built to the design standards set out in the guidelines 'Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities' which are available at www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C1979%2Cen.pdf.  </p><p>In preparing these Guidelines, particular account was taken of the objectives of government policy on sustainability, including access for people with disabilities and meeting the varied needs of occupants through their lifetime. </p><p>The design approach to social housing seeks to eliminate barriers to accessibility for all users - particularly older people, and those with mobility impairment or other disability. Where units are being designed for those with disabilities, the Guidelines refer to the National Disability Authority publication 'Building for Everyone: Inclusion, Access and Use'. </p><p>More recently, the Housing Agency published a Roadmap titled 'Designing Housing to Meet the Needs of All' which has specific regard to the principles of universal design. www.housingagency.ie/sites/default/files/2019-07/Designing-Housing-to-meet-the-needs-of-all.pdf.</p><p>New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2019.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. </p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>The Programme for Government Our Shared Future commits to ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of housing design types provided, including universally designed units, and accommodation for older people and people with disabilities.  In addition, the joint policy statement <i>Housing Options for Our Ageing Population</i>, launched by my Department and the Department of Health in 2019 includes an Action on universal design to &ldquo;In partnership with industry, introduce measures to ensure that over a five year period delivery is increased to ensure that 30% of all new dwellings are built to incorporate universal design principles to accommodate our ageing population.&rdquo;  Appropriate measures to deliver on this commitment are currently being formulated by my Department.</p></reply>

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities and were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change (2008), and the report of the working group on congregated settings, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings (2011).  In 2016, under Rebuilding Ireland the Strategy was extended to allow it to continue to achieve its aims. </p>  <p>  The Strategy has nine Strategic Aims including a key measure which was the establishment in each local authority area of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs). The Steering Groups are the most critical fora in which people with disabilities can influence the delivery of housing in their local areas and includes representatives of key disability organisations as well as the local authority, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the voluntary housing sector. The Groups are tasked with the preparation of a Strategic Plan for delivering housing for people with a disability in their areas by identifying current need as informed by the local authority Housing Waiting Lists, the emerging need over the currency of the Plans and the setting of targets for delivery under each of the social housing solutions available. The Strategic Plans which form a part of the local authority Housing Services Plans provide the local authority and other housing providers with information that helps to inform and guide the provision of suitable housing options for people with a disability over the five-year period of the Plan. As a number of these Plans date from 2016 they will be reviewed in 2021.  The Housing Agency supports local authorities in the operation of the Steering Groups and provides training to the membership of the Groups to ensure that they fulfil their role as envisaged in the NHSPWD.</p>  <p>  At national level the Housing Agency drives the Strategy primarily through its Housing Subgroup which was established to support the effective implementation of the Strategy and to facilitate a uniformity of approach at local level.  The membership of the Group includes representatives of disability organisations who input into the annual work plan of the Group.  Since 2011 the Group has been involved in a number of initiatives under the Strategy including the putting in place of a project for the transfer of people with a low-to-medium mental health need from HSE care to community living with supports. In addition, the Group was centrally involved in the drafting in 2014, and the revision in 2017 of the National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Social Housing Provision for People with a Disability which are an invaluable tool for local authorities in the assessment of housing applications from people with a disability and could not have been completed without the input of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  People with disabilities are also represented on my Department's Implementation Monitoring Group for the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability which reports annually on progress under the Strategy and are also represented on a Disability Consultative Committee chaired by my Department which monitors progress in my Department on the Actions in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, which includes housing for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability will be reviewed in 2021. The Advisory Group will include representatives from the disability groups and part of the work of the Group will be to ensure that the voices of people with a disability are heard effectively in relation to housing provision.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services has been developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.  In general, the operation of emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGO partners involved in the delivery of homeless services.   </p>  <p>  Monitoring and inspection of services is an important element of the Framework, and are a matter for the individual local authorities. This Framework is consistent with Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) standards and seeks to ensure a minimum level of quality in the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons. The standards give service providers a framework for continuous quality improvement in their services and include provisions concerning the accessibility of buildings to service users with common physical or sensory disabilities.</p>  <p>  My Department monitors the provision of homeless services on an ongoing basis, and the regional lead local authorities likewise undertake monitoring and review activities to assure that services are operating effectively.</p></reply>

From this sum, &euro;468 million will be specifically provided to support housing affordability measures.  This includes the Serviced Sites Fund, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p><p>&euro;50 million will be allocated for the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) in 2021.  The purpose of the  SSF to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable new homes for purchase or rent in those areas where local authorities have identified an affordability challenge and the viability to deliver homes and below open market purchase prices.  The SSF is specifically targeted at those local authorities where an affordability challenge had been clearly identified and where the provision of affordable homes is economically viable.  Informed by the affordability and median price of new homes for First Time Buyers in Monaghan, which currently is approximately &euro;200,000, at present County Mongahan does not have active SSF projects.</p><p>In addition to the Services Sites Fund, Budget 2021 ring fenced &euro;75 million for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. I intend to introduce this scheme in 2021 and intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders to inform the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.</p><p>Other measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan, an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme was announced. This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available at .</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p><p>  A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/other/social-housing-support-table-income-limits. </p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Analysis also shows that the demand for the scheme has outstripped the original scheme, and that it does not appear to have had any material impact on national house prices given drawdown levels.</p><p>However, it noted that interest rates should be set to adequately compensate for credit risk, and to minimise distortions to borrower incentives and maximise the benefit of the scheme to those who most require these supports.

The RIHL is targeted at first time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. As part of the eligibility criteria applicant(s) must have received insufficient offers of finance from two mortgage lenders to apply for a RIHL. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.</p><p>All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  </p><p>To be eligible for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan you must:</p><p>-  be a first-time buyer;</p><p>-  be aged between 18 and 70 years;</p><p>-  be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years, as the primary earner or be in continuous employment for a minimum of one year, as a secondary earner- some flexibility on this provision has been provided arising out of COVID-19 for applicants in receipt of the temporary wage state subsidy (TWSS) and pandemic unemployment payment (PUP);</p><p>-  have an annual gross income of not more than &euro;50,000 as a single applicant or not more than &euro;75,000 combined as joint applicants;</p><p>-  submit two years certified accounts if self-employed;</p><p>-  provide evidence of insufficient offers of finance from two banks or building societies;</p><p>-  not be a current or previous owner of residential property in or outside the Republic of Ireland;</p><p>-  occupy the property as your normal place of residence;</p><p>-  purchase or self-build a property situated in the Republic of Ireland of no more than of 175 square metres (gross internal floor area);</p><p>-  or self-build a property which does not exceed the maximum market value applicable for the county in which it is located;</p><p>-  consent to an Irish Credit Bureau check.</p><p>Eligibility is subject to submission of a complete RIHL application form and confirmation by your local authority and I have no plans to change these requirements. </p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p><p>Further information on the scheme is available on the dedicated website www.rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie.</p><p>There are several other measures in place, apart from local authority loans, to support housing affordability.</p><p>The availability of the Help To Buy Scheme for first-time-buyers, which is a policy of the Department of Finance, offers additional assistance to purchasers of newly built properties. Further information is available from revenue.ie.</p><p>In Budget 2021, the total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes was &euro;3.3 billion.  From this sum, &euro;468 million will be specifically provided to support housing affordability measures.  This includes the Serviced Sites Fund, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p><p>In addition to these programmes, and to deliver on our Programme for Government commitments to provide measures for good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and a new<b></b>Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b></b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes both of which will begin in 2021.</p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme. I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.</p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.</p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver Cost Rental housing at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, DLR in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agencie's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units. </p><p>The CREL scheme will see financing made available to AHBs on favourable terms to cover 30% of the costs for Cost Rental homes. CREL funding will be provided on similar terms terms to the existing Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) model which is extensively used by AHBs for social housing. In terms of the remaining 70% of capital costs, subject to appropriate conditions, it is anticipated that long term competitive financing will be made available to the AHBs by the Housing Finance Agency. This will allow cost-covering rents to be set at a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course.</p><p>I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p></reply>

It ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland, including no physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. It provides important safeguards protecting North South cooperation and the all island economy and recognises the Common Travel Area. Crucially, it also protects the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in both.</p>  <p>  The Protocol will apply at the end of the transition period. It is a fully legally operable solution designed to operate in all circumstances, including in the absence of an agreement on the Future Relationship between the EU and UK. It is expressly designed to provide stability and certainty on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the Protocol was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, the EU-UK Joint Committee was tasked with making a number of decisions in respect of the operation of the Protocol before the end of the transition period.   These and other matters continue to be taken forward by the EU and UK in the Joint and Specialised Committees, at which Ireland participates as part of the EU delegation.    </p>  <p>  Throughout the Brexit process, there has been a strong understanding from EU partners of the need to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. The all island economy and the protection of North South economic and social cooperation continue to be at the heart of our approach. This is not just about ensuring frictionless trade; it is also about facilitating peoples&rsquo; lives and livelihoods. Fundamentally, this is about peace, reconciliation and prosperity. </p>  <p>  The Protocol was the result of long and difficult negotiations and represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties. There have been compromises on all sides.</p>  <p>  It is key now that the Protocol is implemented in full and in good faith, as a matter of urgency. The full and effective implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is absolutely central to securing an agreement between the EU and the UK on a future relationship. </p>  <p>  With our EU partners, we continue to urge the UK to move forward urgently on operationalising all aspects of the Protocol.</p></reply>

The rule of law is and should remain a fundamental principle that all EU Member States respect, protect and promote.</p>  <p>  Agreement was reached with the European Parliament on 5 November on a Regulation for a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the EU&rsquo;s budget. This follows the July European Council Conclusions on the MFF/Next Generation EU package which stated that a regime of conditionality to protect the budget and Next Generation EU will be introduced, that the Commission will propose measures in case of breaches for adoption by the Council by qualified majority, and that the European Council will revert rapidly to the matter.</p>  <p>  The Presidency tabled a compromise proposal for a Regulation in September which led to difficult discussions as a number of Member States strongly support the use of protective measures, while others oppose such measures or wish to limit them to very specific breaches as they affect the EU budget.</p>  <p>  The mechanism agreed with the European Parliament will require Member States allocated funding from the EU&rsquo;s budget, including the Recovery Fund and grants or loans, to respect the rule of law which is an essential precondition to comply with the principles of sound financial management enshrined in Article 317 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. It sets out examples of what constitutes breaches of rule of law, including endangering the independence of the judiciary, and the procedure that will apply and possible measures to be taken against a Member State found in breach, including suspension of funding, a requirement for early repayment of loans and a reduction of funding to it under existing commitments. </p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached with the European Parliament, as Rule of Law conditionality has been an important issue for Ireland in the wider MFF negotiations. The agreement means that there will be consequences for Member States for breaches of rule of law and it signals that rule of law issues are important for the EU. It also paves the way for overall agreement on the MFF, on which negotiations are still ongoing.</p></reply>

The principles of equality and non-discrimination are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is important that these principles are protected and promoted throughout the Union.</p>  <p>  The Government has expressed its concerns regarding this issue publicly. My colleague, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne T.D., has also written to his counterpart in the Polish Government, emphasising the deep commitment of the Irish people to the fundamental values enshrined in the EU Treaties, including respect for human rights. </p>  <p>  I have not written to the Polish Prime Minister regarding this issue, as such diplomatic correspondence would normally be addressed to direct counterparts. I can assure the Deputy however that our concerns on this matter have been raised with the Polish Government, and we will continue to raise those concerns through all appropriate channels. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will already be aware of the many initiatives undertaken by the Embassy of Ireland in Poland, together with local non-governmental organisations, to raise awareness of and facilitate discussion of the rights of LGBTI+ people. These efforts continue, in spite of the difficulties presented by the Covid-19 crisis. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work both bilaterally and at the EU level to promote and protect the rights of LGBTI+ people across the EU and beyond.</p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders. I have raised immigration issues in recent contacts with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney, with the US Ambassador, as well as with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress during my visit to Washington D.C. at the end of September.</p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide assistance and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. In 2019, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 88 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, and in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable.</p>  <p>  While comprehensive immigration reform is a complex and sensitive political issue in the US at present, our Embassy and network of Consulates General will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue. We look forward to working with the incoming administration and the United States Congress on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 Visa Bill which is currently before the US Senate, having been passed in the House of Representatives. While the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the congressional agenda, we hope that, when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate.  We will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p></reply>

The EPF is seen as a global instrument and will, in particular, expand the geographical scope of the African Peace Facility. </p>  <p>  While discussions are on-going at EU level to finalise the provisions of the mechanism, it is expected that this mechanism will be operational in 2021.  Member States contributions to the new mechanism will be based on a gross national income (GNI) distribution key.  Ireland's GNI distribution key is expected to increase in 2021 to reflect the impact of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has responsibility for the Athena Mechanism.  Under the proposed EPF, funding for Athena will remain in a separate pillar within the framework of the EPF and will be expanded to account for additional costs associated with EU overseas deployments.  While projected out-turn for Ireland's contribution to Athena in 2020 is approximately &euro;1.7m we have no budget proposal from the EU for Athena for 2021 at this time.  </p>  <p>  The allocation of the &euro;5.0bn for the period 2021 to 2027 for the EPF across assistance measures (under what was the African Peace Facility) and Athena and across each of the seven years of the MFF has not yet been determined.  Also the actual drawdown of funding will be dependent on the number and scale of CSDP missions going forward, the elements of agreed common funding and agreement on the various assistance measures for partner funding.  Given these variables it is not possible to provide precise details of the annual increase in costs arising from the mechanism at this time.  Discussions continue in Brussels on the scope of the measure and the exact provisions and it would seem that that will be agreed before member States turn to consider the budget.  There are on-going discussions here between the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

The process has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-/non-denominational schools across the country.  This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.  </p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETB) identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.</p>  <p>  My Department officials have been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration Process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 Community National Schools.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the Reconfiguration process, my Department is continuing to work with stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified as part of the 2012 and 2013 patronage divesting process surveys. 12 schools have been established under this process, all of which have a multi-denominational ethos.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-12a.660.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200067#WRM03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243, 249 and 253 together.</p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  </p>  <p>  The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.  While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.  National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. </p>  <p>  As part of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NTRIS) published by the Department of Justice and Equality, which aims to improve the lives of Travellers and ROMA in Ireland, my Department has commissioned research on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying strategy on experiences of Traveller and Roma Children. The project was developed in consultation with the Traveller representative groups. The research project has commenced and involves engagement with children and their parents and with schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives.  This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. </p>  <p>  As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to provide guidance and information on supports such as the Yellow Flag Programme.</p></reply>

Costs reflect the very significant level of works completed in 2019 and 2020, complexities to be managed with detailed investigations, developing a remediation solution, retrofitting existing buildings and the need to have detailed and robust arrangements in place to record the investigations and works while ensuring that the schools remained operational where possible.</p>  <p>  Given the legal process for the recovery of costs is at quite an advanced stage, with 2 cases in the Commercial Court and proceedings issued and served in relation to all other 38 schools, the legal advice to the Department is to avoid commentary in the public domain on the details of the Schools Remediation Programme including in relation to costs.</p></reply>

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. </p>  <p>  At post-primary level, there are a number of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate. The decision on which particular text to use rests with the school itself. They can choose whichever text best suits the context of their teaching. </p>  <p>  Achieving a balanced list of texts remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year. For example, the most recently published list of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle English is current for the student cohorts 2018-21, 2019-22 and 2020&ndash;23. This list will be reviewed in the coming months and made available to schools for the 2021-24 cohort.</p>  <p>  A variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts, including the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. In addition, newly published authors are considered for inclusion. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription.</p>  <p>  The prescribed text list working groups for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English is informed and guided by Criteria for the Selection of Texts which aims to achieve a balance between classic and contemporary texts; Irish and non-Irish authorship; seeks gender balance in authorship and representation; embraces diversity and inclusion; accessibility of texts; general suitability and comparative potential. </p>  <p>  Outside of these prescribed works, the decision on any additional texts to support teaching and learning rests with the school.  </p>  <p>  Current and previous text lists offer many opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion/exclusion of particular groups in society. </p>  <p>  The text list for Junior Cycle English currently includes, for example, the novels Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe; Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman; and the play The 14th Tale by Inua Ellams. </p>  <p>  Other texts which offer opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion/exclusion of particular groups in society include The Secret Diary of Anne Frank; The Cay by Theodore Taylor; Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee; Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys and the play Girl from the North Country by Conor McPherson. </p>  <p>  At Leaving Certificate level, the text list for English currently includes Americanah by Chimimanda Ngozi Adichie. A number of texts in translation (generally one film and one novel) are also available for study. In the spirit of embracing diversity broadly, currently, the film Mustang by Deniz Gamze Erguven, the memoir If This Is A Man by Primo Levi and the novel Out of Shadows by Jason Wallace are also available for study. </p>  <p>  The plays Eclipsed by Patricia Burke Brogan and Tribes by Nina Raine and the novel The Lauras by Sara Taylor explore the experiences of marginalised groups, namely women in the Magdalene laundries, the deaf community and transgender teenagers. The classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley offers significant scope to explore the concept of othering in society and to link it to current examples, such as the black lives matter movement.</p>  <p>  How best teachers can be supported in approaching potentially controversial topics (such as those that are very topical in the media at present) always form an important part in discussions in relation to prescribed texts and will continue to do so. In our increasingly diverse society, it is crucial that students see their own story reflected in their learning and teachers should be supported in planning and developing quality learning opportunities that are contextualised to the students sitting in their classrooms. Communication from students as to their experiences in the classroom are very welcome and help shape the support we can offer to teachers.</p></reply>

These products have been on general sale and not just available through the education sector framework. On Friday 23rd the Department of Agriculture further advised not to use any Virapro branded product and this was communicated to schools, with the instruction to store the product pending collection by the supplier.</p>  <p>  On foot of these notifications arrangements were also made to bring to the attention of the wider Department and its aegis bodies guidance on the product recall, and on the follow-on decision to remove from the approved list of products under the Education Sector PPE Procurement Agreement 52 other products which were not subject to the product recall but whose registration status could not be confirmed.</p>  <p>  Based on data supplied by Maxxcare, the supplier of Virapro, it is estimated that 10% of schools have been supplied with Virapro. The total value of the product supplied is estimated to be between &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000. This estimated value is based on sales data and therefore it is expected that the value of the product to be recalled is lower given some product would have been used since purchased.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>-2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website .</p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here:</p></reply>

Among the supports provided is the extension of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panel. </p><p>  My Department has worked closely with our Partners on expanding teacher supply panels.  The base schools were first identified in collaboration with the INTO and Primary Management Bodies.  The INTO and Primary Management Bodies made contact with these schools with a view to being a base for that location.</p><p>  In forming the Supply Panel Clusters, the Department&rsquo;s Geographical Information System (GIS) identified the receiving schools based on distance from the base school.  The Supply Panel Teaching posts were allocated to each Supply Panel based on the number of schools in the cluster and the number of permanent teaching positions to be serviced by the scheme.</p><p>  Currently, there are 115 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 330 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to almost 2,300 schools across the country.  In relation to Co. Louth and Co. Meath there are 5 Supply Panels operating in these counties operating in over 90 schools.</p><p>  These substitute Supply Panels are not the sole means whereby schools source substitutes but are set up to work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers whether through a school&rsquo;s own panel of regular substitutes or the National Substitution portal service as outlined in the Department Circular 45/2020.</p><p>  The proficiencies of the current Supply panels will be monitored and will be reviewed by my Department at the end of the current academic year.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p>  <p>  The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p>  <p>  1. Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p>  <p>  2. Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.  </p>  <p>  3. Utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process.</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government announced the establishment of 45 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022. This included a new post-primary school for the Swords School Planning Area &ndash; Swords Community College, which opened in 2018/19 under the patronage of Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education &amp;amp; Training Board.</p>  <p>  In addition, major building projects are planned, are in train or completed in a number of post primary schools in the Swords School Planning Area, including:</p>  <p>  - Swords Community College &ndash; a new permanent school building for this school, catering for 1,000 pupils was completed in August 2020. The school had an enrolment of 166 pupils in 2019/20.</p>  <p>  - St. Finian&rsquo;s Community College, Swords &ndash; architectural planning has commenced to construct a major building project at the school, which when completed, will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils. The project has been devolved to Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board (DDLETB) for delivery. A number of significant issues have unfortunately arisen, including delays in obtaining statutory consents from the local authority and delays in the finalisation of the detailed design process for the project as it was originally approved.  Based on the report provided by DDLETB, it was agreed at a recent meeting between the Department and DDLETB that this project should be redesigned. The first step in this new plan is the execution of a Service Level Agreement between the Department and DDLETB and this process in under way. Thereafter, DDLETB will procure a Design Team to design the buildings, obtain the necessary statutory planning permissions and move the project onward to construction in due course.</p>  <p>  - Loreto Secondary School, Swords &ndash; my Department proposes expanding this school to provide capacity for 1,000 pupils. The project brief is currently being devised and when completed, the architectural planning process for the project can commence. My Department recently approved 4 additional temporary classrooms to the school to cater for its immediate needs.</p>  <p>  - Fingal Community College &ndash; my Department has agreed the expansion of this school to cater for 1,000 pupils and is currently finalising a project brief for this proposed project under our Additional Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, my Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.  </p>  <p>  In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable - generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation.</p></reply>

To qualify for an award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions. At 66, those on Invalidity pension transfer automatically to the State Pension (Contributory) at the full rate. Invalidity Pension is taxable. Recipients are entitled to a Free Travel Pass and may also get extra social welfare benefits, for example, the Household Benefits Package.  Invalidity Pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on Invalidity Pension was over &euro;728 million in 2019, continuing a steady increase from almost &euro;673 million in 2016.  The expected expenditure for 2020 is almost &euro;749 million.  There were 58,168 recipients in 2019, with 76,577 beneficiaries when qualified adult and children are included.</p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  Any change to the rate of payment would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for credited employment contributions, absences from work would have to arise due to notified incapacity for work,  proven unemployment, or periods during which the person was in receipt of certain other social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  The community employment scheme is designed to assist people who are long-term unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged to get back to work by offering part-time and temporary employment placements in the community.  Community employment is not a social welfare payment. Participants pay social insurance at PRSI class A8 or A9 depending on the weekly income level and such contributions are reckonable for all benefits under the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  Credited employment contributions are awarded to an insured person in receipt of the one-parent family payment who, immediately prior to qualifying for the payment, was entitled to be credited with employment contributions and was in receipt of certain social welfare payments. These payments include  maternity, health and safety, occupational injury benefit, adoptive or paternity benefits; carer's benefit or allowance; invalidity pension or disability allowance; pre-retirement allowance; jobseeker's benefit or allowance or illness benefit. </p>  <p>  As the person concerned was not in receipt of one of these social welfare payments prior to being  in receipt of the one-parent family payment, credited employment contributions were not awarded.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Data on the processing times of these applications are not currently available.</p><p>My Department has allocated over 26,000 PPSNs through this temporary service. </p><p>It is inevitably the case that a temporary process such as this will not be as efficient as the face-to-face process it has temporarily replaced, neither for applicants nor for the staff dealing with those applications. </p><p>It is also the case that some applications can take longer to process than others, due to the different types of evidence that must be submitted; the absence of any such evidence means the customer must be emailed or written to and processing is paused until a response is received.</p><p>The Level 5 restrictions currently in place mean that a full resumption of the PPSN allocation service in local offices is not possible at this time.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is essential that those who need a PPSN can get one when they need it and additional resources have been reassigned to deal with email and postal PPSN applications.  I expect this will result in improved processing times and a reduction in the number of applications in hands. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The State&rsquo;s capacity to bring such children to Ireland is determined by the available care placements, and the commitments that the State has made to unaccompanied minors who are already here. </p>  <p>  These options include expansion of care placements, the development of specialised foster care placements, and provision of aftercare supports when children turn 18. </p>  <p>  In practical terms, my Department, Tusla the Child and Family Agency are working with the EU, who are implementing new Standard Operating Procedures, to identify unaccompanied minors who wish to come to Ireland.

This was necessary in order to meet the State&rsquo;s obligations to persons seeking international protection.  It is important to note that protection applicants accommodated in such accommodation premises receive all services and allowances as those accommodated in dedicated centres.</p>  <p>  Emergency accommodation providers essentially provide a room and full-board service to protection applicants. Dedicated acccommodation centre operators must provide additional support and liaison services and these services, and the requirement for inspection, are contractual obligations for the contactors. One of the most important services which is required is the establishment of a local Friends of the Centre Group to address recreational, cultural and integration needs of residents. </p>  <p>  Emergency accommodation providers cooperate with IPAS in the delivery of clinics for residents, currently being provided remotely, and resolution of any complaints from protection residents including dietary requirements and access to local services.  They liaise with IPAS in respect of any issues that residents may have which they cannot themselves resolve.</p>  <p>  Residents of both the dedicated centres and the emergency premises are required to comply with the IPAS House Rules and Procedures but residents of emergency premises must also comply with the standard house rules of the commercial operators.  In most cases such rules are required under law for the operation of commercial residential accommodation.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the emergency centres also continued to provide accommodation to other paying guests.  However, in order to better protect the international protection residents, IPAS moved to secure such accommodation premises for the exclusive use of IPAS clients.</p>  <p>  The inspection process operated by IPAS for dedicated accommodation centres is to ensure adherence to the contractual obligations of contractors.  As noted already emergency accommodation providers do not have these contractual obligations.  Such premises are required to be compliant by law with health and safety regulations and planning requirements and may be subject to inspections by a range of authorities in this regard, including the relevant Local Authority, the Environmental Health Office of the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority. In addition Bord Failte, as the body responsible for ensuring that accommodation standards meet visitor needs, sets the requirements for the various categories of tourist accommodation and provides for processes for the regular monitoring of the standards in hotels and all other forms of approved accommodation.</p>  <p>  Regular visits are made to all emergency accommodation centres by IPAS and any issues that arise are brought to the attention of the accommodation provider for resolution.  In addition, all accommodation premises may also be visited by a range of other bodies, including the UNHCR, the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, civil society organisations and charities. Where issues are brought to the attention of IPAS by such bodies it is endeavoured to resolve them quickly. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.  We have also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper which I expect to publish by the end of the year.   </p>  <p>  My Department will be giving priority to improving the quality of accommodation by moving away from the use of emergency accommodation and providing own-door accommodation wherever possible in any additional accommodation brought on-stream during the transition process.</p></reply>

To the best of Tusla's knowledge, no items procured during March to May 2020 are the subject of any recall by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Post May 2020, the purchase of hand sanitisation products and other PPE products was devolved to the four Tusla Regional Offices. At present, it is unknown whether any of the material purchased post May 2020 by Tusla was the subject of any such recall. The necessary enquiries are being made by the appropriate personnel and Tusla will advise the Deputy when the information is received.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the National Disability Authority (NDA) incurred expenditure amounting to &euro;454.36 inclusive of VAT for the purchase of relevant hand sanitiser products in June 2020.  This product was purchased as part of a programme of preparedness in line with the Government&rsquo;s Return to Work Protocol. The NDA is currently in contact with the supplier to arrange for a suitable replacement. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) expended &euro;535.00 (excluding VAT) on wipes that were subject to the recall referred to. These products were replaced by the supplier.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Ombudsman for Children's Office that the Office will respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a targeted youth funding scheme aimed at supporting young people between the ages of 10 and 24 who are at risk of becoming disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable.</p>  <p>  This scheme sets out the process by which new services may enter the scheme and how existing schemes may be augmented. In allocating funding under the scheme, each Education and Training Board (ETB) carries out an Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service requirement process. This process draws upon quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within the ETB&rsquo;s functional area. This assessment process leads to the development of a Service Requirement which is then used as the basis for the UBU application process. This approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidenced need.</p>  <p>  The total value of the grant for the youth service concerned in 2020 is &euro;367,970.  As part of the application process, Dublin Dun Laoghaire Education Training Board (DDLETB) provided the youth service concerned with a Service Requirement document outlining the needs and target groups to be supported under the UBU scheme.  DDLETB is there to support the Youth Service in implementing the Service Requirement of the area.  The DDLETB Youth Officer meets regularly with the Youth Service to this end.</p></reply>

On the same day that Department removed the supplier of Virapro and its entire product offering from the Education Sector PPE Procurement Agreement and advised all schools and other educational institutions to cease all use of these products. These products have been on general sale and not just available through the education sector framework. On Friday 23rd the Department of Agriculture further advised not to use any Virapro branded product and this was communicated, with the instruction to store the product pending collection by the supplier.</p>  <p>  On foot of these notifications arrangements were also made to bring to the attention of the wider sector and aegis bodies on the product recall, and on the follow-on decision to remove from the approved list of products under the Education Sector PPE Procurement Agreement 52 other products which were not subject to the product recall but whose registration status could not be confirmed.</p>  <p>  Based on data supplied by Maxxcare, the supplier of Virapro, it is estimated that 10% of schools have been supplied with Virapro. The total value of the product supplied is estimated to be between &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000.  Just one Higher Education Institution and a small number of other colleges were involved in the total recall. The value of the product involved is incorporated in the estimate referred to. This estimated value is based on sales data and therefore it is expected that the value of the product to be recalled is lower given some product would have been used since purchased.  It should be noted that most Institutes of Higher Education have very limited staff and students on premises currently.

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds.  I am aware that DCU has adopted a flexible model where students can book and pay for accommodation for a number of days and nights, rather than the full semester. I also understand that where a student in DCU accommodation paid a deposit but chose not to take up the accommodation they will have the deposit refunded in full. I will continue to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation.</p>  <p>  Ultimately universities are autonomous under the Universities Act 1997, and it is not within my remit to direct them in relation to the management of their student accommodation, which they have financed from their own resources. Students should engage directly with their institution to see if an arrangement can be reached.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact of the pandemic has had on our students. To ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education, the majority of college will be online for this semester and we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for students shortly.</p></reply>

Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There are also legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.  However, I am very much aware that parental alienation is a complex issue and that further analysis may be desirable.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published a report last year on Reform of the Family Law System which includes parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  My department has recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group which will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. As part of its work, the oversight group will consider the various recommendations, including the recommendation on parent alienation, contained in the Report of the Joint Committee. </p>  <p>  The oversight group includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as officials from my Department.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. In the preparation of the General Scheme of that Bill, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System.  </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill will be a key element of the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years.  </p>  <p>  This season, approximately 2 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, including 1.35 million doses of QIV vaccine for adults, and 600,000 of nasal LAIV for children aged 2-12 years. The amount procured for this year is almost double the amount administered last season in Ireland. Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer have not been as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines. </p>  <p>  The fourth round of vaccine distribution to GPs and pharmacists which was completed on 11 November will bring to 1.3 million the total number of injected doses distributed. The remaining doses of vaccine will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. </p>  <p>  Retail Pharmacists have been administrating influenza vaccine as part on the National programme since influenza season 2012/2013. However, this is the first season that the nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children aged 2-12 years is available. </p>  <p>  The number of doses available for pharmacists was based on their usage of adult flu vaccine as an indication for their first delivery of LAIV. Pharmacists were automatically allowed to order the same amount for subsequent deliveries every fortnight, but were allowed to request an increase in the amount for every subsequent delivery if they had demand for the vaccine. To date 75% of 600,000 doses purchased by HSE have been delivered to sites. </p>  <p>  Demand for the flu vaccine this year is unprecedented.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact. Distribution of the remaining doses will be controlled by the HSE to target administration to those at-risk groups where it is most needed.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, unfortunately, this means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread. At Level 5 only essential retail and essential services will remain open.

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  </p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. </p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. </p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Joint Committee's recommendation regarding the establishment of an independent inquiry into the use of valproate medicines in Ireland, there are no plans to hold such an inquiry at present.</p></reply>

Not only do our hedgerows contribute to the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere but they are also vital as a habitat for wildlife, a resource for biodiversity and a unique heritage feature that must be managed and protected. </p>  <p>  To address the lack of data on hedgerow sequestration, Teagasc has recently commenced a research project called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo;. The overall objective of this project is to &ldquo;advance the understanding of the contribution of hedgerows and non-forest woodland to carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes, and to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  While this project is at an early stage of deployment, I am confident that the final results will provide the necessary data to allow for the development of strategies and schemes to maximise the carbon sequestration potential of this valuable resource and contribute additional data required for the inclusion of hedgerows in the national inventory calculations.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the Department sought to enhance the protection afforded to Irish hedgerows by designating them as a &ldquo;Landscape Feature&rdquo; under the Good Agriculture and Environmental Conditions of Cross Compliance. This designation not only ensures that hedgerows are a protected feature under the Common Agricultural Policy rules but also that they are eligible areas for payment under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraint rules. The protection of hedgerows is further enhanced under Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations which set out the requirements placed on a farmer where the removal of hedgerows is being considered.</p></reply>

The agriculture sector has a key role to play in the supply of bioenergy feedstocks as a positive contribution to the decarbonisation of energy systems through the displacement of fossil fuels and energy intensive materials. The 5th progress report of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan outlines in detail the development and share of biofuels made from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material.</p>  <p>  In terms of the extent of production of beet, research has shown that prior to the sugar industry being decommissioned, sugar beet was the main break crop of choice on many tillage farms. It&rsquo;s superior profitability relative to other crops was a significant factor in its selection as a break crop. Since the sugar industry was decommissioned, the area of beet (fodder beet and sugar beet) has declined; however, it has stabilised at between 8,000 and 10,000 hectares in the last 5 years. Beet is now grown due to demand for highly palatable, high energy feed in ruminant diets but is still used as a break crop in tillage rotations.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, some 8,268 hectares of beet (primarily fodder beet and some sugar beet) was declared to my Department under the Basic Payment Scheme. Other break crops are now been grown such as maize, protein crops (mainly beans) and oilseed rape.</p></reply>

This report found that, in 2008, the biosector accounted for 40% (over &euro;8 billion) of net foreign earnings from merchandise exports. This was more than double the biosector&rsquo;s 19% share (almost &euro;16 billion) of merchandise exports in that year.  The reasons for the sector&rsquo;s disproportionately large net contribution to earnings from exports included:</p><p>- Import requirements per euro of Biosector exports were lower than in the Non-Biosector and</p><p>- Receipts of EU payments were almost entirely in support of agriculture and its exports. This is especially a feature of the Biosector, unlike the Non-Biosector, where they are negligible.</p><p>While a similar analysis has not been conducted since 2012, each year the Department monitors the contribution of the sector and publishes up-to-date analysis and statistical information from a variety of sources in the Annual Review and Outlook.</p><p>The Annual Review and Outlook for Agriculture, Food and the Marine 2020 [2], which I launched last month, outlines that agri-food exports in 2019 were &euro;14.5 billion. This represents growth of 42% since 2012 when exports were valued at &euro;10.2 billion. It also outlines that the food and drink sector continues to source a very large proportion of its raw materials in Ireland and states the Food &amp;amp; Drink sector purchased the majority or 78.6% of its materials in Ireland in 2018, while the services sectors purchased just 33.5% of their materials in Ireland. </p><p>The sector is a key economic and social driver underpinning the vitality of rural villages and towns across the country and continues to make a substantial contribution to the Irish economy.</p><p>[2] </p></reply>

I chaired my first meeting of that Committee in September where we discussed the Government's ongoing response to COVID-19 and the various supports that have been put in place across Government and the State Agencies. We also discussed work on Brexit preparedness, which has of course been ongoing for the last few years. </p>  <p>  Activity within the agri-food sector is essential to maintaining food supply chains and therefore has continued in operation during the pandemic. While production was not significantly impacted, demand for food and drink products were subject to widespread market disturbance. In the first few months of the pandemic there were lower prices across all commodities, but these have now largely stabilised. Although food retail demand increased, it did not offset the decline in food service demand, which experienced a near-total collapse due to the shutdown of the hospitality sector across Europe and beyond. That demand imbalance had and is still having significant consequences for primary producers and agri-food businesses. Agri-food exports for January to August 2020 are down 3.3% in value compared to the first 8 months of 2019. My Department will continue to monitor this and other impacts for the sector.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of ten-year strategies to guide its development and we have committed in the Programme for Government that this should continue with the preparation of a new strategy to 2030. A Committee of sector stakeholders has been working since late last year on this new strategy. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. Obviously the Committee will consider both COVID-19 and Brexit in developing this new strategy.</p></reply>

This year a particularly virulent form of the disease, known as Highly Pathogenic AI (HPAI) with subtype H5N8, has been confirmed in several species of wild birds on mainland Europe. There have also been confirmed cases in poultry flocks in the Netherlands, Germany and one in Cheshire in the UK. The virus can spread from the wild bird population to poultry farms, through direct contact and in particular through faeces from wild birds infected with the virus. While this subtype can cause serious disease in poultry and other birds, no human infections with this virus have been reported world-wide and therefore risk to humans is considered to be very low.</p>  <p>  The risk of incursion of highly infectious and economically damaging diseases, such as HPAI, can be reduced through the practice of effective biosecurity at farm level. If consistently applied, biosecurity measures will help prevent disease, whether exotic to or endemic in Ireland, from entering a farm and from spreading within a farm.  The strategy emphasises the importance of good biosecurity in protecting and improving animal health and welfare as well as contributing to good public health outcomes. The strategy will provide a road-map that seeks to ensure that good farm biosecurity is consistently practiced by all farmers at all times, and not just in the face of an immediate risk of a disease outbreak.</p>  <p>  The Department is in close contact with industry stakeholders in relation to the strict bio-security measures are necessary to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into poultry and captive bird flocks. Flock owners are urged to remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a National Farmed Animal Biosecurity Strategy, which will be launched before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The national forest estate is an important store for carbon, estimated at over 312 million tonnes.  Ireland&rsquo;s total forest area is not a net emitter of greenhouse gases and is a substantial sink for carbon dioxide compared to other land uses.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation EU Regulation 2018/814, Ireland, like all EU Member States, had to submit a National Forestry Accounting Plan which sets out the emissions and removals resulting from older forests. These forests for the purposes of greenhouse gas accounting under the regulation are referred to as &ldquo;managed forest lands&rdquo;. The regulation also requires that a forest reference level is set for the period 2021-2025. This reference level is needed in order to account and report greenhouse gas changes from 2021-2025 against this land category. Ireland&rsquo;s forests in this category include all forests that are older than 30 years of age during the period 2021-2030. While the Managed Forest Lands (MFL) area, because of particular circumstances and timing, will be a small emitter over the upcoming period, the amount in question will be far outweighed by what the rest of the forest estate is storing and sequestering. </p>  <p>  The forest reference level is based on the continuation of sustainable forest management, as documented in the period from 2000 to 2009 with regard to dynamic age-related forest characteristics in national forests, using the best available data. It is the intention to continue to manage these forests sustainably and based on harvest levels outlined in the long term round wood production forecast. Roundwood production will increase over the next number of years as forests mature and replanting takes place. </p>  <p>  The important point to note is that the entire forest estate under long term projections is and will remain a net sink for carbon dioxide up to 2050 as outlined in the National Forest Accounting Plan. Detailed modelling, projections and sensitivity analysis will be required to estimate carbon removals post 2050 in conjunction with the level of harvest, afforestation and deforestation in the coming decades.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, due to delays at EU level, the next EU LEADER programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  The objective of the Transitional Programme is to allow locally-led rural development projects to continue to be delivered using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences.</p><p>The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed. We are therefore planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Transitional Programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, but with the scope to extend this if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament. </p><p>An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.  I can confirm that this allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, as well as for new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme.  The funding will also support the administration costs of Local Action Groups, who deliver the programme locally, in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.  <b></b></p><p>It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as the projects are completed. Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.</p><p>The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.</p></reply>
