I would like, at the outset, to take this opportunity to wish Secretary Tillerson, who has now left his position, all the best for the future.  I look forward to working with his successor in due course, once the nomination process has been completed.</p>  <p>  The meeting with Secretary Tillerson was conducted in a warm and constructive atmosphere, as befits the relationship between our two countries. </p>  <p>  While we discussed a wide range of bilateral and global issues, the Deputy will appreciate from her own time as T&aacute;naiste that much of the detail of such discussions must, by its nature, remain confidential. </p>  <p>  I am happy however, to confirm to the Deputy that amongst the topics which we discussed were the plight of undocumented Irish citizens living in the United States, the appointment of a new US ambassador to Ireland, the situation in the Middle-East, Brexit and the situation in Northern Ireland, including the possible appointment of a US Special Envoy.</p>  <p>  On the undocumented, I reiterated once more the priority which the Irish Government attaches to achieving a solution for our citizens and to finding greater legal pathways for migration from Ireland to the United States. As the Deputy will be aware, the issue was also subsequently discussed by the Taoiseach and President Trump when they met in the Oval Office on March 15 last.  Our efforts to find a solution, working with the Administration and with our friends on Capitol Hill, and with the Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, will continue.</p>  <p>  On the broader Ireland-US relationship, I indicated to the Secretary of State how well-received the appointment of a new US Ambassador to Ireland in the near future would be and how it is seen as a very important position in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I updated Secretary Tillerson on the current situation in Northern Ireland. In particular, I indicated that we would welcome the appointment of a Special Envoy for Northern Ireland by the US Administration, as part of its continuing support for the Peace Process. </p>  <p>  I also briefed the Secretary of State on the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, emphasising Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the EU and our opposition to a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  We discussed the Middle East Peace Process, an issue to which I have attached a high priority as Minister for Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade, as I have reported to the House previously. It was a good opportunity to outline to the Secretary of State Ireland&rsquo;s position on the key issues. </p>  <p>  We also discussed US tax reform and whether it would have any implications for the bilateral economic relationship. </p>  <p>  All in all, it was a very constructive meeting, indicative of the strength of the political and economic relationships between Ireland and the United States.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-28a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032800070#WRC00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 61 together.</p>  <p>  The continued suffering of civilians in Syria remains a source of deep concern. I am particularly concerned by the impact of the recent fighting in the Afrin region, including the displacement of over 100,000 civilians. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February. Ireland regrets that this has not yet been implemented and calls on the international community to redouble efforts to ensure the immediate and full implementation.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland in early February, shortly after the commencement of the Turkish operation. They conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s overarching concern for the protection of civilians, including in the context of this particular operation, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. </p>  <p>  Moreover, at the EU-Turkey leaders&rsquo; meeting in Varna on Monday, the EU informed President Erdogan of the EU&rsquo;s concern regarding Turkey&rsquo;s actions in Syria, in particular the situation in Afrin. They stressed that escalating violence and displacement in an already tragic and volatile situation must be avoided. They also emphasised Turkey&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU understand Turkey&rsquo;s concern about the conflict raging on its southern border. Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the conflict, including in terms of migration and spill-over of violence. However, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a long-standing supporter of the UNHCR which has been providing humanitarian assistance in response to the developing crisis in the Afrin region. Ireland provided core funding of &euro;7.5 million to UNHCR in 2017. Core funding enables UNHCR to respond efficiently and effectively where assistance is most needed, including in response to sudden displacement emergencies. Ireland has also provided over &euro;7 million to UNHCR specifically for its response to the Syria crisis since 2012. </p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to reiterate my call on all parties to exercise restraint in order to avoid any further exacerbation of this already fragile situation, and to cooperate in the effort to find a political solution under UN auspices. This alone can bring lasting peace to Syria.</p></reply>

This year&rsquo;s grant scheme was launched by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee, TD on 8th March last, coinciding with the Regional Citizen&rsquo;s Dialogue on the Future of Europe in Letterkenny, Co Donegal. This year, funding up to a total of &euro;100,000 will be available to voluntary organisations, educational bodies and civil society groups to support projects which communicate European issues to the general public. The maximum individual grant will be &euro;15,000. The Communicating Europe Initiative   is aimed at deepening public awareness of the role the EU plays in our daily lives and at improving the quality and accessibility of public information on European issues, particularly at regional or national level. </p>  <p>  Projects should seek to communicate European issues, the role of the European Union and Ireland's place in Europe and may include public conversations through Citizens' dialogue-type events. </p>  <p>  Projects promoting dialogue on the Future of Europe are particularly encouraged this year. Further details of the Communicating Europe Scheme can be found on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website. It has also be promoted via NGO and other stakeholder networks. The closing date for applications is Wednesday 18th April next.</p></reply>

This system provides Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, rule of law, an independent judiciary, democratic separation of powers, and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. I believe that this continues to deliver positive benefits to the people of Hong Kong, to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, and its global partners, including Ireland. I hope that electoral reform in Hong Kong can be taken forward in future, within the framework of the Basic Law and the &lsquo;One Country, Two Systems&rsquo; principle, in a manner that is democratic, fair, open and transparent.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-28a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032800070#WRC02200"><p>The Passport Service monitors the volume of applications on an ongoing basis to ensure that resources are available to meet demand.  In order to respond to anticipated application increases and to seasonal demands, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (&ldquo;TCOs&rdquo;) this year to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  The vast majority of the TCOs will be on a 26 week contract. The Passport Service commenced recruitment in October and November of last year for the intake of TCOs for this year.  This intake commenced in early January, and all of the TCOs will be in place by the end of March. The allocation of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff assigned to the Passport Service as of 1 January this year is 322.  This is an increase of 7% on the previous year.  In addition, my Department has been working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the additional permanent staff requirements for the Passport Service.  I am pleased to advise that 20 more newly appointed, permanent staff have joined the Passport Service since 1 January. Targeted overtime for the Passport Service was also sanctioned to increase processing capacity.   In managing increasing application volumes, my Department&rsquo;s approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff, but to continue to implement service improvements in order to provide an exceptional service and minimise the impact exceptionally high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The award winning online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.  At present, the online service only accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications. It is planned to further extend the online passport application service to all renewals by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is working hard to minimise the impact of high application volumes on turnaround times and to ensure that all resources, including staffing, are effectively deployed.</p></reply>

The ruling will be fully considered by the Government.  It is important to note that, although the Court dismissed the Government&rsquo;s application for a revision, nothing in last week&rsquo;s judgment alters the Court&rsquo;s original 1978 ruling that the men suffered inhuman and degrading treatment, in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  My thoughts are with the men who suffered this treatment, and who have had to deal with the long-lasting effects. I know that they are understandably disappointed with the judgment.</p>  <p>  I have previously discussed with the Deputy the prospect of meeting the men to hear their experiences. Unfortunately a scheduled meeting had to be postponed due to Storm Emma, but I am due to meet the men in the coming weeks, and look forward to hearing directly from them.</p></reply>

The situation in Syria is indeed unconscionable, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of the barbarous violence against civilians that has been the hallmark of this conflict to date. The brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime, which has included use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, has cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, 3 million people are trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The recent increase in violence, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process. The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  I attended the UN Security Council briefing on Eastern Ghouta in New York last month at which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations. Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February. However, the regime&rsquo;s bombardment of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, has continued in defiance of this resolution. There have even been reports of further chemical attacks in recent weeks. The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides political and financial support to a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN. Ireland co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council earlier this month that requested the Commission of Inquiry to urgently conduct an investigation into the recent events in Eastern Ghouta. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. The relevant working groups in Brussels keep the impact of sanctions under review and propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. More recently, last month EU Member States undertook to consider the preparation of best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to further facilitating the work of NGOs participating in the humanitarian response to the crisis in Syria.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 26 February and 19 March. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU hosted a donor conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling &euro;5.6 billion were made, and will host another donor conference for Syria in April 2018.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis. Ireland will make a further pledge of humanitarian support in 2018 at the Brussels donor conference next month.</p></reply>

This comprises research and outreach being carried out by individual Government Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academic and others. Recent publications include the detailed response plan "Building Stronger Business - Responding to Brexit by competing, innovation and trading", which was prepared by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and sets out a number of actions and supports already in place with a view to addressing the regional impact of Brexit.    This research and outreach is informing the Government&rsquo;s contingency planning, which is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department. Each relevant Government Department has established the risks and impacts posed by Brexit, and provided mitigating actions, for their respective sectors.  This work, which focuses on a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; or worst-case outcome, provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This includes, as appropriate, any specific responses necessary according to regional needs and at the county level, including in Wexford. </p>  <p>  The Government will publish a new paper in the coming months on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectorial challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.</p></reply>

Maintaining frequent bilateral contact with EU partners is also a priority, both at political and official level. Such meetings provide an opportunity to communicate Ireland&rsquo;s priorities, including in relation to agriculture, with a view to shaping the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position with regard to the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including its Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the EU&rsquo;s approach to framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  As concerns my personal engagement with the Taskforce, I have met with Michel Barnier in advance of both the February and March meetings of the General Affairs Council (Art. 50). These efforts are yielding clear results. The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement currently being negotiated between the EU and the UK, sets out in legal terms the backstop arrangement. It allows for full alignment with those rules of the EU's internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  As set out in Article 5 of the draft Protocol, this arrangement would include alignment with the provisions of Union law on sanitary and phytosanitary rules as well as provisions of Union law on the production and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products.   It has always been intended that the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found. In this regard, the Government shares the UK&rsquo;s preference to resolve these issues through the wider agreement on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. I look forward to seeing the UK&rsquo;s detailed proposals in this regard, and to considering proposals on specific solutions. I also welcome the Guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship which were adopted by the European Council last week, which confirm the EU&rsquo;s readiness to initiate work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA) insofar as there are sufficient guarantees for a level playing field. The EU proposes that such an agreement should cover all sectors, including agriculture, and should address, inter alia, disciplines on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation.</p>  <p>  Brexit is an issue that naturally arises during the frequent bilateral contacts which I, my Government colleagues and our officials have with our UK counterparts. While stressing that Ireland is a member of the EU27 and that the issues involved can only be substantively considered and addressed through the ongoing EU-UK negotiations, such opportunities provide an opportunity to build the UK&rsquo;s understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities with regard to the Irish-specific issues as well as the future EU-UK relationship, including in the area of agriculture. </p>  <p>  In recent months, I have had numerous engagement with British Ministers. This has included the Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley. Minister Creed has also met with his counterpart, Secretary of State Gove, during the course of his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to London. Brexit, and issues relevant to agriculture, have arisen in these meetings. </p></reply>

Ministers also discussed developments in Venezuela, expressing deep concern at the deteriorating humanitarian, economic, political and social situation. During the discussion on the Middle East Peace Process, I updated my EU counterparts on my recent meetings in Washington with US Secretary of State Tillerson and Jared Kushner. I urged that the EU play a strong and proactive role in any new peace initiative and encouraged the Palestinians and other regional interlocutors to engage constructively on this.   EU Ministers met over lunch with Foreign Ministers from Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and the discussion focussed on the Middle East Peace Process.</p></reply>

Canada and Norway are the other two candidates.   Like Ireland, both countries have strong records of engagement at the UN and we co-operate closely with them on a range of issues. In order to be elected to the Security Council, Ireland will need to secure the support of two-thirds of the UN membership &ndash; approximately 129 votes of the 193 Member States. The campaign leading to the vote in 2020 is well under way.  Member States normally signal their intention to seek election many years in advance.  In this regard our candidature was first announced in 2005 and the campaign has been building since then.  I am taking every opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s candidature with the representatives of Member States.  Last month I met with the representatives of countries from a number of regional groups at the UN&rsquo;s Headquarters in New York.  I and my Cabinet colleagues will continue to make Ireland&rsquo;s case in the period ahead.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic staff in Ireland, our Permanent Representation to the UN in New York, and our entire Embassy network have been actively presenting our case and seeking support. This effort will continue.   The Security Council campaign is an opportunity to demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy values and credentials.  Our candidature also reflects the centrality of the UN to Irish foreign policy.  In making our case to the electorate, we will be highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of membership.  Among the areas in which we have built a strong reputation at the UN are peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights.    </p>  <p>  The Security Council is the UN body with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is difficult to predict what issues might be on the Council&rsquo;s agenda in 2021 &ndash; 2022 should Ireland&rsquo;s candidature be successful.</p>  <p>  The Council&rsquo;s agenda today is, in many respects, very different to the one that faced its 15 members even just five years ago.  Conflict and post-conflict situations in individual countries and regions remain central to the Council agenda.  Increasingly, the Council is giving consideration to policy areas which are seen as important factors in international peace and security, including migration, climate change, the role of women and youth, sustainable development and food security. In this regard, it is noteworthy that this month, under the Presidency of The Netherlands, the Council has included discussion on water and conflict, as well as hunger and conflict</p>  <p>  If Ireland were to be elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council our fundamental approach to any agenda item would be to advocate for the core values of our foreign policy - peace and security, justice, equality and sustainability.</p></reply>

Based on these Directives, Michel Barnier reported to the GAC (Art.50) on 20 March that agreement had been reached at the level of negotiators on the text of transition in the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The European Council on 23 March welcomed this agreement but made clear that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that all issues in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, need to be agreed to ensure progress in the negotiations.  </p><p>I welcome that the terms reflected in the draft Withdrawal Agreement are fully consistent with the EU&rsquo;s objective of agreeing a transition period based on the status quo. This is an approach that I strongly advocated as it will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses. Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.</p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound. This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period and this has been reflected in the text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. This also takes account of the EU&rsquo;s budgetary processes and the fact that the current Multiannual Financial Framework will conclude at the end of 2020. But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects. It is therefore welcome that the General Affairs Council has agreed to keep this under constant review, taking account of developments in the Brexit negotiations.<i></i>This provides the flexibility required.</p></reply>

I have expressed these concerns myself directly to Israeli leaders during my recent visit to the region in January.   Despite occasional improvements on specific details, worsening aspects have been accurately tracked in reports such as those by UNICEF, referred to by the Deputy, and a recent report by B&rsquo;Tselem, an Israeli NGO with whom we have contact.</p>  <p>  For me, the bottom line is that Palestinian children are clearly subject to widespread treatment which Israel would &ndash; correctly &ndash; consider to be unacceptable for its own children. </p>  <p>  The case to which the Deputy refers is one which exhibits many issues that concern us. Firstly, the way in which protest against the occupation can be criminalised and suppressed. Secondly the exertion of political pressure in Israel to press the military authorities to take heavy handed and highly publicised action against a Palestinian family who posed no genuine security threat. And thirdly the treatment of Palestinian minors and their families to pressure them to accept plea bargains which then supposedly justify the whole process.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Israeli authorities should re-examine these approaches in this case and in others. Until they do so, the image of Israel and the legal system imposed on Palestinians will be gravely impaired.</p></reply>

It represents a very positive development in Ireland-Colombia relations.   While the embassy will seek to develop all aspects of the bilateral relationship, Ireland has made a particular commitment to supporting the peace process and, as a consequence, is very engaged on human rights issues in Colombia.  This includes exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level and regular engagement with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active in Colombia.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with human rights defenders from Colombia as recently as last week, and met with those working on human rights issues in the Department of Choco in early February 2018.    Since 2014, Ireland has provided funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commission for Human Rights in Colombia (OHCHR) to support its vital work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, including Choco. </p>  <p>  Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in our Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, maintain regular engagement with the EU Delegation in Bogot&aacute;, which has led on a number of visits to the Choco region, including a high level visit by EU Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process, Eamon Gilmore. Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia.  We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund, one of the aims of which is to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples and afro-descendants. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is committed to supporting peace and human rights in Colombia.  Having a permanent diplomatic presence on the ground in Colombia, working with the Colombian authorities and with our EU partners, will greatly enhance our ability to meet that commitment.</p></reply>

Israel has already used other measures in certain cases to revoke residency rights of East Jerusalem Palestinians, quite clearly in order to alter the demographic balance of the occupied area. This is explicitly prohibited in international law, and Israel has no right to do it. The European Union issued a very clear statement on this issue on 9 March, which was as follows:</p><blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F">This week, the Israeli Knesset adopted legislation which empowers the Israeli Minister of Interior to revoke the permanent residency status of persons involved in terrorism, treason or espionage.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">The European Union rejects terrorism in all its forms, and the crimes set out in this legislation are very serious. However, the new law could make the residency status of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, a protected population under International Humanitarian Law, even more precarious than it already is today. The new law could be used to further compromise the Palestinian presence in East Jerusalem, which would further undermine the prospects of a two-state solution.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">In line with international law, the European Union does not recognise Israel&rsquo;s sovereignty over the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, including East Jerusalem, and does not consider them to be part of Israel&rsquo;s territory, irrespective of their legal status under domestic Israeli law.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">The European Union will closely monitor if and how this new law is applied to Palestinians in East Jerusalem.</font></blockquote><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I fully endorse and repeat those comments.</font></p></reply>

I am aware that judicial proceedings are under way and that nine Catalans have been remanded in custody pending trial, and the former President has been detained in Germany on foot of a European arrest warrant. As these are matters before the courts it would not be appropriate for me to comment.   The future of Catalonia is a deeply divisive and contested issue. These divisions were reflected in the results of last December&rsquo;s regional elections, and in the difficulties being encountered in appointing a regional President and Government.  In the interim, direct rule remains in effect in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Constitution.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for regional parliamentarians to reach agreement on the appointment of a regional President so that a regional government can be formed.

The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently 14 working days, one day ahead of the target turnaround time of 15 working days.

Despite repeatedly stating its commitment to improving its human rights record, the Bahraini Government appears to be targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive attitude to those opposing or challenging the Government in any way.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution are undermined by many examples of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.     Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues and restrictions of civil liberties in Bahrain are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain. Last month, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain and Embassy officials in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017.  In advance of this review, the Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, where human rights concerns in the Kingdom were discussed. At the Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this month, Ireland supported an EU statement under Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) which reiterated calls on Bahrain &ldquo;to maintain its commitments as to the respect of freedom of speech and human rights defenders.&rdquo; We also made reference to Bahrain in our national Item 4 statement highlighting our grave concerns over the ending of the de facto moratorium on use of the death penalty. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department, both here in Dublin and in Geneva, engages with a number of Irish and international NGOs on human rights issues in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

The UK has agreed that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Report published last December, and that this will apply unless and until another solution is found. The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU draft of the Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution to the border issue. We have always been clear that our preference is to avoid a hard border through a wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK, a view we share with the British Government. We look forward to seeing the UK&rsquo;s detailed proposals in this regard, and proposals on specific solutions.    The importance of avoiding a hard border to people living in all the border counties, including Cavan and Monaghan, cannot be underestimated and the Government is acutely conscious of this. The North South cooperation we enjoy today brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people in the border region and contributes to economic opportunity and development.  It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit. It is for these reasons that there cannot be a return to border infrastructure of any kind on this island.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, in addition to considering UK proposals on the border, our objective will be continue to close the remaining gaps to agree the Protocol. In this regard, the EU and UK agreed on an intensive schedule of meetings, which have started earlier this week. We expect that the Withdrawal Agreement should be finalised by October, to allow time for approval.</p></reply>

The main objectives for my visit included further enhancing our bilateral political relations, making solid economic progress on both trade and investment priorities and also connecting with the Irish communities in China celebrating St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. </p>  <p>  The four-city visit began in Hong Kong, and included a meeting with the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Mrs. Carrie Lam. I engaged in meetings with Enterprise Ireland client companies, the Irish Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong representatives of  the Irish Funds network, and participated in the launch of Bord Bia&rsquo;s &lsquo;East meets West&rsquo; Cookery competition. Finally, I attended the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception in Hong Kong, where I was joined by Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung and a range of key community, cultural and business contacts. </p>  <p>  From Hong Kong, I travelled on to Shenzhen and Shanghai, where I met with a range of Bord Bia, IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies, undertook media engagements, and attended both an official and Irish community St Patrick&rsquo;s Day receptions. </p>  <p>  Finally, I visited Beijing, where I had a number of political meetings, including with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. We discussed a wide range of domestic and regional political and economic developments, as well as bilateral and international issues. On 15 March, I was delighted to be present at the launch of the direct flight between Dublin and Beijing, which will be operated by Hainan Airlines from June 2018 and will have a transformative effect on our relations. I participated in a range of events to promote trade and investment between Ireland and China, with a particular focus on the aviation, agri-food, financial services, education and ICT sectors. In addition, I witnessed the Greening of the Great Wall of China and attended the annual St Patrick&rsquo;s Day Reception which included the attendance of official, media and business contacts, as well as members of the Irish community. </p>  <p>  The range and scale of events in China to mark St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is very impressive and I was very happy with the level of engagement by Chinese authorities.  My visit for Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day provided me an important opportunity to pursue Ireland&rsquo;s interests in a major world power and the second largest global economy.</p></reply>

Holding elections is a key element of the Action Plan, and must be a priority for resolving Libya&rsquo;s political fragmentation. There have been some positive signs on voter registration, with 2.5 million Libyans now eligible to vote, and, notably, a strong participation rate by women. I hope that this can be translated into a high turnout in the elections. However, I understand the concerns of those who caution that holding elections precipitately may complicate, rather than expedite, a lasting political solution to Libya&rsquo;s governance crisis. Indeed, the UN Special Representative is conscious that there is much work to be done to lay the ground for credible elections, as he expressed in his briefing to the UN Security Council last week.   Specifically, there are significant logistical challenges to holding elections in a country where armed groups control large swathes of territory, and where serious security threats persist. In addition, there are a number of constitutional and legislative measures that need to be resolved. Finally, there must be a commitment by all parties to accept the outcome of the elections. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously in the House, I am deeply troubled by the abuses perpetrated against migrants in Libya. My EU colleagues and I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions at the Foreign Affairs Council, as did the Taoiseach at the European Council in October. I call on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations. </p>  <p>  Libya needs a functioning coastguard in order to rescue people in danger at sea. It is unacceptable that, on being rescued, migrants would be placed in inhumane conditions. The EU provides training, including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues, to Libyan authorities. The EU is also working with the African Union and the UN to save and protect the lives of migrants and refugees in Libya, accelerating assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin, and the resettlement of those in need of international protection. The success of this cooperation is dependent on a Libyan government with effective, united and accountable institutions.  </p>  <p>  In sum, a functioning and stable government for all Libyans is crucial to addressing the many challenges the country faces, including ongoing efforts to improve the situation of migrants and refugees, and to ensure accountability for their ill treatment. Free, inclusive and credible elections would be an important step in this direction. I call on the Libyan Government, and all parties to the conflict, to guarantee the freedoms of assembly, association and speech, in order to foster an environment in which the democratic will of the Libyan people can be freely expressed. I am conscious that this will be a considerable test for Libya, and indeed the international community, and will require a spirit of compromise and good will on all sides. However, if successful, this would represent an important milestone in Libya&rsquo;s transition towards an inclusive, democratic and peaceful future. </p></reply>

The EU and its member States, including Ireland, had concerns about this resolution, both because of the burden it would place on the resources of the OHCHR, and because the terms of the resolution were drawn in such broad language as to potentially include businesses with only tenuous or inadvertent connections with settlements. Despite these reservations, Ireland of course assured the OHCHR that we would cooperate fully with any request for assistance in the task they had been assigned. The OHCHR subsequently wrote to all UN Member States seeking any information relevant to the compilation of this database. In the case of Ireland the name of one company, which had been reported to have such connections with settlements, was included by the OHCHR in this request.   The Government does not collect or maintain any information of its own in relation to such activities in settlements, and the communication from OHCHR gave no details of the reported activities of this company. Ireland&rsquo;s response to the OHCHR therefore stated that the Irish authorities did not possess any additional information in relation to that case, or the nature of any allegations against this company. </p>  <p>  The OHCHR is understood to be in the process of communicating with companies thus identified in this initial exercise, and may issue further information when this is complete.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and has recently published its National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020. The implementation of this plan is a priority for the Government over the coming years, with the objective of promoting responsible business practice at home and abroad.</p></reply>

My concerns about Syria are focused on the consequences of the appalling violence into which the country has descended in recent years.  Any use of military force is something which Ireland would always see as a last resort. However, in view of the Syrian Government&rsquo;s evident and heinous willingness now to use conventional and even chemical weapons indiscriminately against its own civilian population, it is not a matter of regret that the Syrian Government&rsquo;s attempt to develop a nuclear programme was brought to an end some years earlier.</p></reply>

The war is now ongoing for more than three years, and has had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life. Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining support. In 2017, Irish funding of over &euro;5 million was allocated to the UN&rsquo;s Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund (YHPF), which supports NGOs and UN agencies, including UNICEF, which have the best capacity to deliver services on the ground. Furthermore, the EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget.    At the Foreign Affairs Council in December last year, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to address our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen. The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year, and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access. There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.</p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict. Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of Martin Griffiths as the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen and fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

However, EU Missions in Palestine, including Ireland&rsquo;s, have cooperated closely in following and reporting on the progress of the case. Irish or other EU representatives arranged to be present at almost all of the hearings in relation to the case.   The ruling against an open trial was indeed a matter of concern, although in the event it was almost immediately superseded by the conclusion of the case following an apparent plea bargain agreement.</p>  <p>  There are of course often grounds for a case involving a minor to be held in private. But in this case the observers to be excluded would have been there largely with the consent and in support of the family. </p>  <p>  It would be unacceptable if the operation of military justice under an occupation regime were to exclude outside observers who are welcomed by the defendants and their families. The presence of EU and other observers at such proceedings has provided at least some degree of independent scrutiny of proceedings.</p></reply>

The specific question of applying a trade ban to exert pressure on Israel over these questions has been raised very frequently in the Oireachtas, and successive Governments and Ministers for Foreign Affairs have made it clear that they do not consider such actions would be feasible, effective, or productive, and we therefore do not support them.   Ireland exists in a trading union, and our external trade frontiers and rules are those of the European Union. There is no support whatever at EU level for trade sanctions on Israel.</p>  <p>  It is also worth recalling that the great majority of our trade with Israel is Irish goods and services sold to Israel, and that the impact of such a ban would therefore be felt almost entirely in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland has pressed for and been instrumental in the adoption by the EU of a number of measures to differentiate between EU relations with Israel and the illegal Israeli settlements in Palestinian Territory. These have included excluding settlement goods from lower tariff rates, guidelines on labelling settlement goods, advice to business and citizens about investing in settlements, and rules that prevent EU research grants from being spent in settlements.

I have no difficulty with discussing this at European level, but it is a matter of judgement what is the most important and fruitful aspect to try and advance at any given time or meeting.</p>  <p>  Ireland has already previously raised at EU level the question of whether settlement goods should be excluded from the EU market &ndash; this being a separate question from suggestions of sanctions on trade with Israel, which we do not support. In addition, the EU and its Member States are in near continuous discussion and negotiation at official level on all aspects of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including many which bear in some way on questions to do with settlements and settlement goods. </p>  <p>  It is absolutely clear from these continuous contacts that there is no possibility whatever of getting substantial support, still less consensus, for a proposal to exclude settlement goods. The reality is that a substantial number of EU partners are highly resistant to such proposals, precisely because they consider them to be steps towards a trade ban, which they will not at this point countenance. Advocacy on this issue would only be likely to be counterproductive for other ideas we might pursue.</p>  <p>  We have therefore instead focussed our efforts in relation to settlements on practical measures to differentiate in EU policies between Israel itself and the illegal settlements. This has resulted in a number of EU measures already, including guidelines on labelling of settlement goods, and exclusion of settlement institutions from EU research funding. I have, nevertheless, asked my officials to continue to explore further such options, as well as the potential for them to gain support from EU partners, and such discussions at official level will inform my continuing assessment on how best to take this issue forward.</p></reply>

The reports by UNHCR catalogue a number of human rights concerns that are having a particular effect on children, including settler violence, displacement and forcible transfer, home demolitions and forced evictions, and the arrest and arbitrary detention of children.</p>  <p>  Many of these issues are linked to settlement construction and discriminatory policies favouring settlers and settlements over the rights of the Palestinian population.  Ireland therefore continues to advocate for a greater international focus on these issues, and for stronger measures against settlements. The settlement project is contrary to international law, gravely threatens the prospects for a peace agreement, and inherently involves continuing and cumulative injustices and provocations to Palestinians.  It is clear however that these injustices will only be fully ended when the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is ended. I have therefore also prioritized, in my engagement at local, EU and international level, the need for continued political effort to revive a political process to end the occupation.  Ireland also supports Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are actively engaged in combatting injustices and discrimination on the ground.</p>  <p>  During my working visit to Israel and Palestine in January, on which I have reported to the House, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including settlement construction and the treatment of minors in detention, in my contacts with the Israeli administration. In a statement on 12 January, I condemned Israel&rsquo;s announcement of plans for further settlement units in the West Bank. </p>  <p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s national statement at the most recent session of the Human Rights Council we condemned again the continuing and accelerating expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory. We also expressed concern about the situation of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, where the historic community is under great pressure.</p></reply>

Online passport renewal applications are processed in the Mount Street office.  The public offices in Mount Street and Cork also continue to accept applications from all categories of applicant, by appointment, at their public counters. Where appropriate, these offices also facilitate the issuance of emergency passports. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed. Additional measures taken by the Passport Service include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime.  The Passport Service received sanction this year for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork in accordance with application volumes allocated to each office.  The vast majority of these officers are already in place with the remaining expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at latest.  Of these Temporary Clerical Officers, 40 were assigned to the Passport Office in Cork. In addition to this, 10 Clerical Officers and 1 Executive Officer have joined the Cork Passport Office&rsquo;s permanent staff since the beginning of the year.

Discussions regarding these reforms are currently ongoing among UN Member States, with Ireland&rsquo;s central participation.  Many parts of the UN system are also contributing to the reform efforts.  Central to this work is the concept of sustaining peace, bringing together Governments and all national stakeholders in inclusive partnerships to prevent the outbreak, continuation, escalation and recurrence of violent conflict. In this, prevention is the top priority.</p>  <p>  The reforms seek to reduce fragmentation and allow for better delivery, and making the peace and security pillars of the UN more coherent, nimble and effective. Ireland is deeply committed to the multilateral system, and very supportive of the UN reform efforts.</p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to delivering Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance programme in the most effective way, providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight against global poverty and hunger, including through working with multilateral partners.  </p>  <p>  The ability of these multilateral channels to reach the poorest and most fragile countries and regions in the world, and deliver real results on the ground, is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s financing and engagement.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides core, multi-year funding to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) which leads and coordinates the global humanitarian response and recently approved funding of &euro;2.9 million to the organisation for 2018.  This funding is intended to support the UN&rsquo;s ability to respond effectively to global humanitarian need, including in Syria, where UN humanitarian agencies and partners continue to reach millions of people in need.  Through our upcoming role as chair of the OCHA Donor Support Group, Ireland will continue to work closely with OCHA to increase the effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s humanitarian response. </p>  <p>  An end to violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which call for an end to violence; full humanitarian access; a democratic political transition, and accountability and transitional justice. </p>  <p>  Ireland plays an active role in the relevant management structures of our multilateral partners, for example as Board Members of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund this year.  In addition, we use our Embassy network, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, to monitor the work of our multilateral partners on the ground and to ensure that aid reaches the targeted population.  </p>  <p>  In addition to participating in the ongoing discussions and reviews, Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems to ensure it is enabled to fulfil its crucial role in the maintenance of international peace and security, prevention, reduction and resolution of conflict and the upholding of fundamental human rights.</p></reply>

It is drafted to give legal effect to the commitments and guarantees provided in the EU-UK Joint Progress report of last December on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including North South cooperation and rights.  The draft protocol also reflects the agreement reached on the maintaining the Common Travel Area.  Progress has been made on the draft Protocol during the most recent round of negotiations, which concluded on 19 March.  This is recorded in an annotated version of the draft Withdrawal Agreement published by the EU Taskforce on 19 March, which reflects agreement on some articles of the draft text, including the <i>Common Travel Area</i>and <i>Other Areas of North South cooperation</i>.  During the negotiations, the UK also accepted that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.  Prime Minister May confirmed these agreements in her letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, on 19 March, in addition to reiterating the UK's commitment to agreements reached last December on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee on avoiding a hard border.</p><p>I welcome that the European Council, it its guidelines adopted on 23 March, made clear that &ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo; and has stressed that work remains to be done in order to achieve overall agreement, notably on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  To this end, an intensive schedule of negotiations has been agreed between the EU and the UK over the coming weeks with a view to continuing efforts to narrow the remaining gaps on the draft Protocol.  The European Council, with the support of the Council, will continue to follow the negotiations closely, in all their aspects, and will return in particular to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland at its June meeting. I therefore expect significant progress to made an agreeing the Protocol ahead of this meeting of the European Council.</p></reply>

The devolved, power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are the best means for achieving accountable, representative decision-making for all the people of Northern Ireland.  The electorate in Northern Ireland affirmed their support for power-sharing through the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in May 1998 and have provided a mandate to the political parties to form an Executive and Assembly.  Everyone agrees that devolved power-sharing institutions are in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland and the Government continues to work with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to support that outcome.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.

Our Embassies and Consulates provide direct assistance in many cases, through consular visits and practical advice and assistance to individual detainees, and our consular assistance team at HQ provides ongoing support and assistance to the families of such prisoners.  We also work through our partnership with the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO), which receives funding from our Emigrant Support programme, to support Irish prisoners overseas and their loved ones.</p>  <p>  Support and assistance in all such cases is provided on a non-judgemental basis, irrespective of the offence of which the citizen has been accused or convicted. </p>  <p>  It is impossible to provide precise statistics for the number of Irish citizens detained or imprisoned overseas.  In some cases the individuals involved do not seek any assistance or do not want the Irish authorities to be informed of their situations.  In some other cases, regrettably, local authorities sometimes fail to notify the Irish authorities of the imprisonment of our citizens.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s records show that consular assistance was requested and provided in approximately 300 cases involving Irish citizens imprisoned overseas between 2013 and 2017.</p>  <p>  In 2013 my Department opened 55 new cases in this category.  In 2014, there were 52 new cases.  2015 saw 55 new cases.  2016 saw 45 new cases, and in 2017 53 new files in this category were opened.  In addition, there are a number of cases which were ongoing since prior to 2013 and for which assistance continued to be provided.</p>  <p>  Every case is different and is considered and approached on its own merits.  Some cases may last only a relatively short time, and the assistance needed may be quite straightforward.  Others, such as the high-profile case of a young Irish citizen who was detained in Egypt from August 2013 until October 2017, can be extremely difficult and complex, and can require the deployment of significant resources over a protracted period of time.  </p>  <p>  Beyond the cases where we are requested to provide direct assistance, through our partnership with the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas, and in some cases also through other emigrant support organisations, we provide substantial indirect supports to a large number of other Irish prisoners.  We estimate that, at any time, there are around 1200 Irish men and women in detention overseas and, working with the ICPO, we try to reach out and offer support to as many of these as we possibly can. </p>  <p>  So far in 2018 my Department has provided consular assistance in 11 new cases involving Irish citizens who have been imprisoned overseas.</p></reply>

She made a compelling case in support of her government&rsquo;s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a military-grade nerve agent, and that there is no plausible alternative explanation.Having listened to the Prime Minister, and to the views of other Member States in a position to support her account, EU leaders unanimously agreed with the United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s assessment.  They affirmed that all EU Member States stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security.</p>  <p>  The use of chemical weapons, including the use of any toxic chemicals as weapons, by anyone, anywhere, is particularly shocking and abhorrent.  The attack in Salisbury was not just an attack against the United Kingdom, but an affront to the international rules-based system on which we all depend for our security and wellbeing.  </p>  <p>  In light of the European Council Conclusions, and following an assessment conducted by the security services and relevant Departments, I briefed the Government yesterday on my intended course of action.  At my request the Secretary General of my Department subsequently met the Russian Ambassador and informed him that the accreditation of a member of his staff with diplomatic status is to be terminated, in line with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  The individual in question is required to leave the jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  I want to make clear that there would be absolutely no justification for the expulsion of Irish diplomats from Russia.  Our staff do not engage in activities which are incompatible with their diplomatic status. Nor has Ireland acted improperly.</p></reply>

At the Foreign Affairs Council in February, Ireland added its voice to calls for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council in resolution 2401 adopted on 24 February.  Last week, Foreign Affairs Ministers heard from Staffan de Mistura, the UN Secretary General Special Envoy for Syria, who gave us an analysis of the situation on the ground.  He informed us of the limited implementation of UNSCR 2401, with the bombardment continuing in defiance of this resolution.    Mr de Mistura also updated us on his efforts to bring about a negotiated political solution to the conflict. Ireland and the EU fully support his work in this regard. </p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region, in support of the efforts of the Special Envoy.</p>  <p>  The EU will also host a donor conference for Syria in Brussels in April, building on the EU-hosted conference in 2017 at which pledges totaling &euro;5.6 billion were made.  The EU and its Member States have mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance in response to the crisis, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.</p>  <p>  The conference will focus on humanitarian support and bolstering the UN-led political peace process in Geneva.  The Foreign Affairs Council in April will likely adopt Council Conclusions on Syria setting out the EU position ahead of the donor conference, and Ireland will participate in the discussions on these. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25.5 million in 2017 alone.  Through our annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis. Ireland will announce its pledge of humanitarian support for 2018 at the EU-hosted donor conference in April. </p></reply>

It is drafted to give legal effect to the commitments and guarantees provided in the EU-UK Joint Progress report of last December on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including North South cooperation and rights.  The draft protocol also reflects the agreement reached on the maintaining the Common Travel Area.  Progress has been made on the draft Protocol during the most recent round of negotiations, which concluded on 19 March.  This is recorded in an annotated version of the draft Withdrawal Agreement published by the EU Taskforce on 19 March, which reflects agreement on some articles of the draft text, including the <i>Common Travel Area</i>and <i>Other Areas of North South cooperation</i>.  During the negotiations, the UK also accepted that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft Protocol will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.  Prime Minister May confirmed these agreements in her letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, on 19 March, in addition to reiterating the UK's commitment to agreements reached last December on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee on avoiding a hard border.</p><p>I welcome that the European Council, in its guidelines adopted on 23 March, made clear that &ldquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo; and has stressed that work remains to be done in order to achieve overall agreement, notably on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  To this end, an intensive schedule of negotiations has been agreed between the EU and the UK over the coming weeks with a view to continuing efforts to narrow the remaining gaps on the draft Protocol.  The European Council, with the support of the Council, will continue to follow the negotiations closely, in all their aspects, and will return in particular to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland at its June meeting.  I therefore expect significant progress to made an agreeing the Protocol ahead of this meeting of the European Council.</p></reply>

Commissioner Oettinger also met with the Taoiseach, Minister Donohoe and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy during his visit, which was focused on the forthcoming negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), which will be a key challenge and priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s efforts have already yielded results and it is clear that there is a firm understanding at EU level of the unique and disproportionate impact that Brexit will have on Ireland.  This has already been reflected in a number of concrete measures and commitments to date, such as the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s support for the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Loan Scheme.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is also working actively, with the support of other relevant Departments, with the European Commission to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  This ongoing consultation process also provides scope to examine issues that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The Government is also working intensively to safeguard the significant financial support there has been for the border region of Ireland and for Northern Ireland, with almost &euro;2.4 billion of EU funding having been provided for successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  The current programmes have a combined value of &euro;550 million over the period 2014-2020, of which 85% is funded through the European Regional Development Fund.  I was delighted, therefore, that December&rsquo;s agreed progress report between the EU and the UK includes a specific paragraph which reflects the Irish Government&rsquo;s ambition to complete the current programmes and to examine favourably the possibilities for future programmes.  In its communication to the European Council that accompanied the progress report, the Commission commits itself to proposing the continuation of the programmes in its proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, which is expected in May.</p></reply>

These Guidelines restate the Union's determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in the future.  However, they also expressly state that the EU&rsquo;s position has to take into account the repeatedly stated positions of the UK, which limit the depth of such a future partnership.  The Guidelines reiterate in particular that any agreement with the UK will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and ensure a level playing field while also protecting the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union.  They point out that a non-member of the Union, which does not live up to the same obligations as a member, cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member.</p>  <p>  I welcome that, notwithstanding these important considerations, the EU has signalled its readiness to initiate work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA) insofar as there are sufficient guarantees for a level playing field.  I also strongly welcome the EU&rsquo;s commitment to revisit its position should the UK&rsquo;s approach evolve.</p></reply>

From the outset, the EU called on the Russian authorities to conduct a comprehensive and independent investigation, and has criticised their failure to clarify the circumstances surrounding Mr. Magnitsky&rsquo;s death.  A number of countries, including some EU Member States, have put in place national &ldquo;Magnitsky Acts&rdquo; freezing the assets of, and withholding visas from, certain Russian officials believed to have acted in violation of human rights.   The question of the nature and scope of EU sanctions is always complex and difficult.  The adoption of sanctions requires a unanimous decision of the Council.  As the Deputy will be aware, EU economic sanctions have been in place against Russia since 2014 in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea and its further actions to destabilise Ukraine. </p>  <p>  To date Ireland has raised its concerns regarding human rights in Russia directly with the Russian authorities and through the EU, the Council of Europe and at the UN Human Rights Council.  In 2016, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed five principles to guide EU relations with Russia.  Key amongst these is strengthened support for civil society in Russia, a position which Ireland fully endorses. </p>  <p>  The question of further EU measures against Russia is likely to be considered over the coming period.</p></reply>

These are the values we bring to our common policies, to our trade negotiations, to our work on peace-keeping and conflict resolution, and to our international development programmes. </p><p>Member States subscribe to these values when they accede to the Union.  They are not optional.

The Department usually receives audited financial statements from these bodies.  In addition, with regard to the UN bodies, the Department receives the reports on internal audit activity that are presented to the executive boards. My Department also has an internal audit function that provides assurance as to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s governance, risk management and systems of internal control, including for the Irish Aid programme.  The internal audit function operates in line with the international standards for internal auditing, and its work is also reviewed by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee.

During the development of the new European Consensus on Development, a shared vision and framework for action for development cooperation among the EU and all the Member States, the Government advocated for a priority focus on basic services including safe drinking water and sanitation.  The new European Consensus is a fundamental part of the EU's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals.  Ireland, together with Kenya, led the process in the United Nations which led to agreement of the SDGs.  One of those goals is access to water and sanitation.  At the UN high level event held in September 2017 on the Implementation of the International Decade of Action on Water for Sustainable Development, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s concern at water scarcity in Africa &ndash; which is increasingly aggravated by climate change.  </p>  <p>  Through Ireland's development cooperation programme, Ireland is taking a number of concrete measures to address water scarcity in Africa.  Access to water is built into Ireland's bilateral aid programme.  In addition to the provision of access to water, the bilateral aid programme also works to increase communities' resilience to climate change.  Our humanitarian response includes a strong focus on ensuring access to basic services including clean drinking water. Ireland funds NGO-led Water, Sanitation and Hygiene programmes, known as WASH, in a number of African countries including Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and Sierra Leone, while Ireland's humanitarian assistance channelled through the UN also funds water and sanitation needs.  This support to the UN helps ensure that those living in places suffering the effects of conflict, such as Syria, or those recovering from natural disaster can get access to clean water.</p>  <p>  I saw this myself at Nduta refugee camp in Tanzania last October: there Irish support enables water to be pumped to meet the needs of over 120,000 refugees from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  My visit there demonstrated to me both the importance of this work but also the precarious nature of access to water on which so many depended.</p>  <p>  In partnership with University College Cork (UCC), Ireland supports the UN Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS), which has responsibility for monitoring global ambient water quality. This &euro;3 million programme is aimed at building the capacity of developing countries to accurately monitor and report on water quality.  UCC provides capacity training. </p>  <p>Ireland will continue to engage in policy discussions at the EU, UN and other relevant international fora on the importance of access to clean drinking water.</p></reply>

In this context, I consider the recruitment and use of child soldiers as among the gravest human rights violations.  Ireland, the EU and UN are working to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict<font color="#2F2F2F">.</font>The EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict, first adopted on 2003 and revised in June 2008, set out EU policy in this area. These Guidelines aim to persuade governments and organisations around the world to apply humanitarian law and human rights that protect children from armed conflict.  They commit the EU to address the impact of armed conflict on children and fight against impunity for those who are involved in the recruitment of child soldiers. </p><p>Since 2002, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an annual report, on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. The most recent report, published in August 2017, cites groups operating in eight African countries; namely the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Mali. </p><p>In 1999, the UN<b></b>Security Council passed its first Resolution, UNSCR 1261, on the impact of armed conflict on children and condemned violations in that context. Ever since then, the Security Council has established vital tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards, including the position of UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict who investigates and develops best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers.  </p><p>Ireland continues to combat the problem of child soldiers with a focus on addressing the socio-economic causes through our development programme. Ireland also supports direct interventions by supporting specialist organizations including UNICEF, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Criminal Court.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the eradication of the recruitment and use of child soldiers is highlighted in our Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Accordingly, Ireland is committed to strengthening regional and international multilateral human rights frameworks and has consistently made positive contributions to various regional and international human rights fora.  In line with this strong history of multilateral engagement, Ireland continues to actively monitor and make interventions in relevant EU and UN fora in relation to the factors driving humanitarian crises and human suffering around the world.  Through these fora, Ireland advocates for the protection of and assistance to those in humanitarian crisis situations around the globe.      Humanitarian crises are complex in nature, frequently resulting in significant displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels, and serious concerns for the protection of civilians.  Such crises require a coordinated response from the international community and, to this end, Ireland engages closely with our UN, EU, Red Cross and other partners.  In 2016, over 75% of our humanitarian funding was provided through the UN and EU, with a similar amount in 2017.  This coordinated response better enables us to reach those in urgent need of assistance and to ensure the protection of those who are most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  Currently, some 80% of humanitarian crises across the globe are conflict-related.  The fact that there are more people in need today than at any time since World War Two is due not just to the existence of the conflicts themselves, but to violations by parties to these conflicts of international law, particularly respect for international human rights and humanitarian law.     </p>  <p>  On this basis, Ireland not only responds quickly to provide humanitarian assistance where it is needed most; we also advocate at EU and UN levels to for full accountability where there have been breaches of international law, which deeply affect vulnerable people.</p></reply>

These groups continue to launch attacks and commit grave human rights violations against civilian populations, particularly women and girls.  The government has consistently condemned their brutal actions and we continue to work with EU and UN partners to promote peace and security and coordinate our humanitarian responses so that we can protect and assist those affected.The exact number of women and girls being held captive by Boko Haram is hard to verify and many, including girls kidnapped from Chibok in 2014, have yet to be released.  During this past week, a majority of the over 100 girls recently abducted from Dapchi were returned.</p><p>Ireland and the EU remain strong and consistent supporters of peace and stability in both the Lake Chad region and Somalia, and with the support of the international community, the Nigerian Government and regional security forces have continued to make progress in the fight against Boko Haram.  The EU has contributed up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, where Nigeria and neighbouring countries promote regional security.</p><p>The EU also provides considerable funding to AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to combat the serious threat posed by Al-Shabaab and support the establishment of Somalia&rsquo;s government institutions.  The EU provides further support to capacity building operations in the areas of maritime law enforcement and military training.</p><p>We are working with EU and UN partners to implement a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of radicalisation in both regions.  This includes the promotion of peace and giving people access to decent work and livelihoods, including via the EU&rsquo;s <i>Instrument contributing to Peace and Stability</i>(IcSP) and the <i>EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa </i>(EUTF), to which Ireland has pledged &euro;6 million to 2020.</p><p>We continue to work with our EU and UN partners to provide life-saving assistance to those affected by the humanitarian crises exacerbated by the actions of Al-Shabaab and Boko Haram.

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost over 400,000 lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta which has cost the lives of hundreds of civilians, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.    Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February.  However, the regime&rsquo;s bombardment of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, has continued in defiance of this resolution.  The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.  The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April of this year at which Ireland will announce its pledge to the humanitarian effort in response to the Syria crisis in 2018. </p>  <p>  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country, and &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland contributing &euro;22.9 million. &euro;15 million of this has already been provided to date.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is also supporting refugee hosting communities in Lebanon and Jordan. Ireland has already contributed &euro;9.67 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Lebanon channelled through UN and NGO partners, and &euro;5.89 million to Jordan through the Jordan Humanitarian Fund. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has also committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region.  To date, almost 2,000 people have already arrived. </p>  <p>  In Iraq, the UN estimates that 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the country begins to recover from the atrocities committed by Da&rsquo;esh.  The current number of internally displaced persons requiring humanitarian assistance stands at almost 3.3 million, of which 1.6 million are living outside of camps in host communities.  In addition, there are an estimated 240,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq.  The EU is working to support the Iraqi government on stabilisation and reconciliation.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, Ireland has provided over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, including &euro;2 million in 2018 for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.  Via our annual contributions to the EU budget, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the situation in Iraq. </p>  <p>  The situations in both Syria and Iraq were discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on numerous occasions in recent months.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in January, Foreign Ministers adopted the new EU strategy for engagement with Iraq, and initiated a formal exchange on migration with Iraq.  EU Foreign Ministers discussed Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February, at the Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February, and again at Foreign Affairs Council on 19 March, at which they had a discussion with UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura.</p>  <p>  Through the EU, Ireland has long advocated for and supported the development of durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons, and in tackling the root causes of displacement.  Through our engagement with conflict-affected countries, refugee hosting countries and our EU counterparts, Ireland supports conflict resolution and development in Syria, Iraq and the wider region.</p></reply>

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace.  It also includes action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.  During my working visit to Israel and Palestine in January, on which I have reported to the House, I met with both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as other representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and discussed with them reinvigorating the effort towards peace in the Middle East.   In recent months the new United States administration has been exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work, and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. </p>  <p>  In recent discussions with my EU colleagues, I have stated that the EU must continue to encourage an appropriate US initiative, but that the EU must also continue our own work, including work on the ground, to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved, and help to combat negative trends, including the deteriorating situation in Gaza.  I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done. </p>  <p>  Immediately after my visit to the region in January, I spoke directly to the US authorities, and pressed strongly for the continuation of US support to UNRWA.  Ireland has provided funding of &euro;8 million to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeals since 2006, of which &euro;500,000 was provided in 2017.  In light of the exceptional circumstances UNRWA is facing, Ireland brought forward our 2018 core contribution to the Organisation&rsquo;s Programme Budget. Earlier this month, Ireland pledged an additional &euro;250,000 to the Agency.</p>  <p>  I have given these issues a high priority in my work since assuming office, both at EU level and elsewhere, as I have reported to the House.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-28a.253.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032800074#WRG03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 140, inclusive, together.</p><p>Carbon tax was first introduced in Ireland in 2010 as a charge on fossil fuels based on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted on combustion.  Initially, carbon tax applied to certain oil and gas fuels and was charged at a rate of &euro;15 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from the fuel concerned.  The application of carbon tax to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011. </p><p>In May 2013, carbon tax was extended to solid fuels with the introduction of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT).  SFCT was charged at an initial rate of &euro;10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted when combusted.  In 2014 the rate for all carbon charges was increased to &euro;20 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted.  Current SFCT rates per tonne are &euro;52.67, &euro;36.67, &euro;17.99 and &euro;27.99 respectively for coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that from May 2013 to the end of 2017 net receipts from SFCT amounted to &euro;91.6m. Currently there are 210 active SFCT registrations.  Annual SFCT net receipts are given in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>&euro;m </th></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>7.3 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>17.2 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>23.5 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>24.4 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>19.1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>91.6 </td></tr></table></p><p>SFCT applies on the first supply of coal and peat in the State and is payable, on a bi-monthly basis, by a taxable person who is registered for VAT and making a first supply.  Every supplier who intends to make a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue. </p><p>Suppliers in the State who import solid fuel and make first supplies in the State are required to register for SFCT.  Importers of solid fuel that is exclusively for their own use (self supply) for the purposes of manufacturing are also required to be registered for SFCT. The obligation to register with Revenue for the purposes of SFCT also applies to suppliers based in Northern Ireland who deliver solid fuel into the State for sale direct to the public.  In this context, I am advised by Revenue that a number of Northern Ireland based suppliers are registered for SFCT. </p><p>It should be noted that SFCT is not payable by a Northern Ireland supplier where that supplier makes the supply at their premises in the North, nor is it payable by private individuals travelling to the North to buy solid fuel for personal consumption if the individual accompanies the fuel back into the State.  It should also be noted that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.</p><p>Revenue collects SFCT on a self-assessment basis and enforces compliance by way of audit of solid fuel carbon tax returns. Liable fuel suppliers must file a return and pay for each bi-monthly period by the last day of the following month. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax due. The estimate is the amount of tax that Revenue will pursue if a supplier does not complete and file their return.</p><p>If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action.  This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.  To date SFCT enforcement actions have included;</p><p>- 35 warrants issued to Revenue Sheriffs with a total value of &euro;461,794 </p><p>- 45 solicitor referrals amounting to &euro;116,670 </p><p>- 1 Notice of Attachment issued for the amount of &euro;32,567. </p><p>SFCT collection is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State.  This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and enforced by local authorities.  I am advised by Revenue that it is in ongoing contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in relation to this area.</p></reply>

Approval may also provide, however, for early retirement from age 50 where scheme rules allow and with the employer's consent.  In such situations benefits are restricted. In the case of approval of personal pension arrangements such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) benefits can be taken from age 60, with early retirement permitted in certain circumstances.  In relation to all of these pension arrangements, benefits can be taken at any stage where retirement is due to serious ill-health or incapacity.  I am also advised that access by an individual to his or her pension funds prior to retirement, either generally or for the purpose of investing directly in sovereign bonds, is not permitted under the rules governing the approval of pension arrangements for tax purposes.</p>  <p>  Under the conditions of approval for occupational pension schemes, an individual&rsquo;s entitlements under a scheme may be transferred to another such scheme, an approved buy-out bond or a PRSA.  A transfer from an occupational scheme to a PRSA is permitted only if the individual has been a member of the scheme or of any other scheme related to that individual&rsquo;s employment with, or with any person connected with, the employer for less than 15 years.  In the case of personal pension arrangements, an individual&rsquo;s entitlements may be transferred from a RAC to a PRSA and from a PRSA to another PRSA or an occupational pension scheme.  A transfer of entitlements from an approved pension arrangement to another such arrangement is not subject to tax where the transfer is made in accordance with conditions applying to the approval of the arrangements in question.</p></reply>

This includes &ldquo;quads&rdquo; that are approved for use under the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 &ldquo;on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles&rdquo;.  The VRT charge is based on the cubic centimetres of &euro;2 per cc up to and including 350cc and &euro;1 per cc thereafter, with a depreciation allowance for the age of the vehicle.  Revenue collects this tax when a vehicle is registered.</p>  <p>  The vehicle in question was required to be registered as it had been type approved and the correct VRT was charged and collected at the time of registration.  The VRT, &euro;495, was calculated on the basis of the cubic centimetres including an element of depreciation because of the age of the vehicle.</p>  <p>  As advised in the correspondence of 28 February 2018 from the Tralee Revenue Office, there are a number of reliefs and exemptions from the tax provided for in the Finance Act 1992, section 134 (permanent reliefs such as transfer of residence, bequest, diplomatic etc.) and section 135C (remission or repayment for hybrid and electric vehicles).  On the basis of the information provided, the case notified does not qualify for any of these reliefs or exemptions.  If there are further reasons why the vehicle should qualify for a refund, these should be advised to the Tralee Revenue Office along with any documentation in support of the claim being made.</p></reply>

Department policy is that children with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent statutory body whose functions include planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE). The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required, once a child has been enrolled in a school. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is also responsible for the establishment of special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p>  <p>  Autism is a spectrum disorder the characteristics of which can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations and can range from mild to severe. The NCSE&rsquo;s Autism Policy Advice, published in 2015, did not recommend any restriction or limits on the numbers of children with Autism which could be present in one mainstream class, nor did they identify any criteria which might indicate a need for such limitations.  </p>  <p>  Circulars 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools, published on 7th March 2017, set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the NCSE allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of needs identified in schools through the identification process.</p>  <p>  This means that, where there are a higher number of children with special educational needs in a school, the school will receive a higher level of supports to support those children.  </p></reply>

The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the NCSE will consider:</p>  <p>  - the school&rsquo;s accommodation and accessibility</p>  <p>  - the number of special classes, if any, already in the school.</p>  <p>  In order to identify need in any area for the forthcoming school year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class. In this regard parents/guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process. </p>  <p>  The report must state that:</p>  <p>  - S/he has ASD</p>  <p>  - S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised officials in my Department that 2 new ASD Primary classes will be established in Firhouse Educate Together N.S for the forthcoming school year. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p>  <p>  In addition to 2 special classes, the special education teaching allocation provided for 2017/18 was maintained at the allocation that the school, referred to by the Deputy, received in the previous school year. In October 2017, the school was provided with an additional SEN allocation of 2.45 hours on the grounds that the school qualified for one additional developing mainstream teaching post. The school has now received a revised total special education teaching allocation which equates to over 2 full time additional Special Education Teachers. This is a very significant allocation for a school of this size, which has a current enrolment of 169 pupils. </p>  <p>  DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017 which set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p></reply>

Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.</p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them. I might add that an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by my Department is expected shortly. This report will help with the further development of the Call for Proposals documentation. </p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the ongoing consultation process. This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters. The consultation process will help to inform further development of the approach in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued.</p>  <p>  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level. I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers. In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach being developed. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services. It is of course a matter for organisations which apply to provide future GYDP services under the Call for Proposals to ensure that they comply with relevant legal responsibilities, including in relation to the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131/2003).</p></reply>

They recognise that firearms dealers are entitled to be in possession of large quantities of firearms but require them to conduct business from a premises that has been constructed to a high standard. The Regulations also recognise the different categories of firearms dealers and scales the requirements depending on the quantities of ammunition and firearms being stored. For example, a time lock requirement does not apply to those dealers who deal only in small quantities of ammunition. </p>  <p>  This Statutory Instrument derives from the powers conferred under Sections 9(10) and (11) of the Firearms Act 1925, which were inserted by Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. Section 9(10) provides &ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Commissioner, may by regulations specify minimum standards to be complied with in relation to premises in which a firearms dealer carries on a business or proposes to do so&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Section 9(11) provides &ldquo;The minimum standards shall be determined by reference to</p>  <p>  (a) the security of the premises</p>  <p>  (b) their safety, and</p>  <p>  (c) their standard of construction,</p>  <p>  and having regard to their use for, as the case may be, the manufacture, repair, testing, proving or sale of firearms or ammunition&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  These provisions were passed by the Oireachtas on 5 July 2006 and signed into law by the President on 16 July 2006 and commenced on 1 January 2008.</p>  <p>  The Regulations were developed following consultation with a sub-group of the Firearms Consultative Panel (FCP) consisting of registered firearms dealers. It was agreed by the FCP when this sub group was being established that the firearms dealers on the Panel at the time should sit on the sub-group for the purpose of examining this particular issue. Firearms dealers&rsquo; premises were visited in fourteen counties prior to and during the drafting of this legislation. The dealers who sat on the sub-group are knowledgeable of the security that they and their colleagues utilise.  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were represented on the group have extensive experience with regard to security measures available in the industry and particularly in firearms dealers&rsquo; premises. </p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised by some firearms dealers, particularly in relation to the time lock requirement.   The inclusion of the requirement for time locks was originally suggested by the sub-group to act as a significant deterrent and discouragement to criminal attack. Some dealers have claimed that their monitored alarm system serves the same purpose as a time-lock.  This is not correct.  The existing monitored alarm system will alert if the strong room is opened but it will not prevent the door from being opened.  The time-lock mechanism will prevent the door from being opened until a time pre-determined by the firearms dealer.  This measure is to make a &lsquo;Tiger Kidnapping&rsquo; situation less likely to occur whereby a dealer could be forced to open the strong room under duress.  The time-lock will lock the door at a time decided by the dealer (e.g. at the end of the business day) and cannot be opened until a pre-determined time (e.g. the commencement of the next business day.)  It is also understood that some dealers view is that time locks would prevent access in the event of a fire and could lead to dealers being held kidnapped for a longer period while waiting for time locks to open. It is likely that criminals would not risk waiting for the deactivation of time locks when there are risks that other security measures included in the premises could be activated e.g. duress panic buttons. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strongly endorsed the security measures contained in this Regulation and has advised that the inclusion of a requirement for a time-lock on the strong room door will deter criminal activity and require the use of greater resources by any person attempting to access firearms or ammunition illegally.  Similar security measures have been applied successfully elsewhere, e.g. in banks, pharmacies and the jewellery sector.     </p>  <p>  In order to minimise the financial impact, a lead-in time of twelve months (to 1 February 2019) for compliance has been included in the Regulation in order to permit dealers sufficient time to comply with the legislation. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans to amend these regulations which have been introduced as a public safety measure.</p></reply>

Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in a given area will be key considerations here. I can assure the Deputy that final decisions in relation to service area boundaries will not be made until the consultation process has been completed. </p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of the on-going consultation process, which includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers to facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters. The consultation process will help to inform further development of the overall approach in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service, so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. While certain aspects of the new approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.  I firmly believe that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.</p></reply>

The Government has approved both Bills to receive priority drafting within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The aim is to enact both Bills by the end of 2018, and if possible sooner in the case of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 also needs to be commenced and this requires the establishment of a Decision Support Service (DSS) under the Mental Health Commission.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the auspices of the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.    </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission with the approval of the Minister for Health. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. However, it is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the full implementation of the 2015 Act, as there are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the prevailing view is that the Decision Support Service will not be ready to become operational until 2019.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums which could apply to provide services under the new GYDP model. In addition, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.

The proposed composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission, which would comprise only 3 judges over 13 (including a lay chairperson accountable to the Oireachtas) would not be in line with European standards (Paragraph 47 of Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)12 adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 17 November 2010), and was opposed by the Association of judges in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Paragraph 47 of Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)12 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in turn, sets out that an independent and competent Authority drawn in substantial part from the judiciary should be authorised to make recommendations or express opinions concerning the selection of judges.</p>  <p>  Of course the Government has taken note of the European Commission comments.  It would point out though that there is no single international binding standard or norm in this area.  It is worth noting that the said 2010 Council of Europe Recommendation also states, in its paragraph 48, that the membership of the relevant independent authorities should ensure "the widest possible representation".</p>  <p>  Judicial appointments reform is part of the Programme for Partnership Government which commits to the introduction of a new structure comprising two central elements of a lay majority and an independent chairperson.  The Bill as published had provided for a substantial judicial presence, through committees of the Judicial Appointments Commission, which ensured direct membership of all of the court presidents in the relevant selection processes, whilst the overarching body had the three most senior judicial offices as members.  The Deputy will be aware that a significant number of amendments originating from opposition parties were made to the Bill by the D&aacute;il Select Committee on Justice and Equality, including an amendment which had the effect of greatly reducing the level of participation of court presidents in the process by removing the presidents of the lower courts from any participation in the new body.  As I pointed out at the conclusion of Committee Stage, it is important to ensure the appropriate and distinct inputs of all court presidents in the selection process, and much more work needs to be done with a view to advancing the Bill to the next stage in its enactment.  My intention now is to bring forward for Report Stage a number of amendments arising from the changes made at Select Committee, including amendments concerning the composition of the new Judicial Appointments Commission and enhanced judicial input, whilst maintaining the Bill&rsquo;s two key components of a lay majority and independent chairperson.  </p>  <p>  I have met with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport recently to discuss the progress of the Bill and related issues.  My officials have briefed me in relation to the comments of the European Commission.</p></reply>

Data is not recorded in whole time equivalent terms.</p>  <p>  My Department as a public service employer has a legal obligation under the Disability Act 2005 to report each year on the number and percentage of employees with disabilities.  Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 sets out the following obligations on Government Departments and public service bodies with regard to the employment of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Public bodies must, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Public bodies shall ensure, unless there are good reasons for not doing so, that at least 3% of their employees are people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Public bodies must report on an annual basis to a statutory monitoring committee within their parent Department on the number of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures they are taking to promote and support their employment.  The monitoring committees in turn submit their reports on such compliance to the Minister of their parent Department and the National Disability Authority (NDA).</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy, 2017 to 2021 is committed to increasing the public sector employment target of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6% by 2024, and will embed this target into all public service workforce planning and recruitment.</p></reply>

It is generally accepted that there is a need to modernise the current GMS contract and ensure that general practice is a viable and rewarding career for medical graduates. My aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. A new contract must be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It must also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency. </p>  <p>  It is essential that engagement on GP contractual issues is aimed squarely at meeting the substantial challenges, current and future, the health service and general practice face. The latest phase of engagement with GP representatives commenced in January 2017, and discussions were progressed on a wide range of items throughout 2017. Discussions are currently paused, and, at my request, officials of my Department are working with their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the HSE to ensure that the overall approach is focused fully on the strategic challenges and on the Government&rsquo;s health services reform agenda. It is important to ensure that any new contract will result in service improvements across general practice benefitting both patients and GPs.</p>  <p>  I expect that engagement with GP representative bodies will commence shortly. I look forward to progress being made in the coming months on the GP contract.</p></reply>

It has been well established that children exposed to valproate in the womb have an increased risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.</p>  <p>  In 2014, following a European Medicines Agency (EMA) review of valproate, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) circulated recommendations to further restrict the use of valproate in women and girls.  The HPRA also recommended that the use of valproate be restricted to doctors experienced in managing epilepsy or bipolar disorder in female patients, and provided advice for situations where it was considered that valproate treatment needed to be continued during the pregnancy.</p>  <p>  In March 2017, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the EMA initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.  This review has now been completed, and the committee&rsquo;s recommendations were published by the EMA in February.  The key measures recommended by the PRAC are as follows:</p>  <p>- Valproate must not be used in pregnancy for the treatment of migraine or bipolar disorder.</p>  <p>- Valproate should not be used in pregnancy for the treatment of epilepsy.  However it is recognised that for some women with epilepsy it may not be possible to stop valproate and they may have to continue treatment (with appropriate specialist care) in pregnancy.</p>  <p>- Valproate must not be used in female patients from the time they become able to have children &ndash; unless the conditions of a new pregnancy prevention programme (PPP) are met.</p>  <p>- The PRAC has also recommended that the outer packaging of all valproate medicines must include a visual warning about the risks in pregnancy.  In addition to boxed text, this may include a symbol/pictogram, with the details to be adapted at national level.</p>  <p>- A patient reminder card will also be attached to the outer package for pharmacists to discuss with the patient each time the medicine is dispensed.</p>  <p>- Companies that market valproate should also provide updated educational materials in the form of guides for healthcare professionals and patients.</p>  <p>  The PRAC&rsquo;s position on sodium valproate has since been endorsed by an EMA regulatory committee, the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures &ndash; Human (CMDh), and the recommendations will now be sent to the European Commission for a legally binding decision on all member states.  Officials in my department are already working with other stakeholders, including the HPRA, HSE, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to determine how these recommendations should be implemented in Ireland.</p>  <p>  At my request, officials from my department met with representatives from FACS (Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome) Forum Ireland in November.  I have been briefed by officials as to the issues raised, and I am scheduled to hold a further meeting with this group today, 28 March. </p></reply>

Current prices, which stand at &euro;138.7/100kg are 16% below prices at the same time in 2017, which was an exceptional year for pig prices, but remain above price in the same period in 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department has made a concerted effort to support market diversification.  The importance of this is illustrated by the significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to East Asia, and to China in particular.  The uncertainty surrounding Brexit lends an even greater importance to the expansion of access to international markets.  </p>  <p>  In June of last year I visited Mexico, now the fourth largest global importer of chilled and frozen pork.  With Mexican demand continuing to grow I have made access to that market a priority.  I also travelled to Japan and South Korea last autumn to promote the development of further opportunities for Irish producers in these markets as I want to continue to diversify the range of markets to which Ireland has access.  Exports to Japan more than doubled to &euro;22m in 2017, putting it in second place in international markets.  We can reasonably expect that the new free trade agreement with Japan (JEEPA) will further enhance trade opportunities. Growth in the Philippines was also strong, up 54 % making it the third largest international market for Irish pigmeat exports.</p>  <p>  With Irish production up almost 1% in 2017 and export value increasing some 14% to an estimated &euro;712m, I intend to continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, to take advantage of opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.</p></reply>

Ireland has been very consistent on this issue in recent months especially as discussions around potential increases in GNI contributions have been floated.  The Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament in January 2018, has already indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal. </p>  <p>  Both I and my colleague Minister of State Doyle will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible as negotiations on CAP post 2020 intensify.</p></reply>

The key objective of AIM is to support pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education.</p>  <p>  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. AIM was launched in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of the DCYA. </p>  <p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). </p>  <p>  Once Pobal awards Level 7 support to a pre-school, the pre-school can decide to either reduce the child to adult ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room through a recruitment process (if the pre-school does not have access to a staff member to fulfil this role as is the case for most smaller pre-schools). In the normal course of events, the recruitment process can take several weeks as the pre-school will have to advertise, review applications, interview candidates, carry out Garda vetting and agree a start date with the successful candidate. </p>  <p>  Neither Pobal nor my Department have a role in the recruitment of staff for pre-schools. However, the local CCC funded by my Department would be willing to support recruitment of additional assistance to deliver Level 7 supports and have done so for other settings in the county.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  The review will take account of the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

For example, where a person of working age is a qualified adult on their spouse&rsquo;s jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance claim that person may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance in their own right.

There are no plans to alter these requirements, and it would be administratively impossible to establish such continual unemployment other than by reference to continuous receipt of a relevant income support payment.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that qualified adults may be eligible for the rural social scheme (RSS), which is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen/women through spousal swaps.  If a person eligible for the RSS does not wish to participate on the RSS, his/her dependent spouse/civil partner/cohabitant can apply in their place.  In these instances, the person originally qualified must give up his/her qualifying social welfare payment if his/her spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is accepted on the RSS.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including Part B (Fire Safety), rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in response to the many building failures that emerged in the last decade, my Department has been working on a building control reform agenda, including the following:</p>  <p>  - the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification;</p>  <p>  - working closely with the Local Government Management Agency on the oversight and governance of the local authority Building Control System to improve its effectiveness; and</p>  <p>  - progressing primary legislation, the Building Control (Construction Industry Register      Ireland) Bill 2017, to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector.</p></reply>

As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report, will be undertaken during the second quarter of this year, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in Q3 2018. </p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines</i>remain in force.</p></reply>

It is available in all local authority areas and its introduction now ensures that all social housing supports can be accessed through the local authorities, allowing tenants to take up full-time employment and keep their housing support, subject to adjustment of their differential rent.</p>  <p>  HAP is paid directly to landlords and may be payable to Approved Housing Bodies who can demonstrate that they are entitled to be landlords of a particular property. This might include long term lease arrangements where the AHB is entitled to be a landlord in a property they have leased. </p>  <p>  HAP would only be payable following submission of a valid application completed by the tenant and landlord. AHBs would also be required to confirm that there has been no other State funding provided in respect of the particular property to ensure no double funding arises.</p>  <p>  My Department has contacted the charity referred to for specific details and will liaise with the Local Authority and charity to identify potential mechanisms to facilitate the best outcome for the social housing tenants involved.</p></reply>

This working group met as recently as 5 March 2018 when a provisional work programme was agreed which anticipates a draft plan being ready for circulation in mid-summer.</p>  <p>  The new plan will focus on conservation and will inform a list of priority conservation and site management actions and measures. Focusing on the lands that are in the ownership of the State, it will inform future interventions on the site, aided by the ongoing monitoring of visitor numbers by the OPW. The Plan will not, nor is it intended to, address land use and planning issues in the wider environs of Tara. It will nevertheless help to inform the future planning and development of the area.</p>  <p>  Public consultation will be a key component in developing the new plan. As a first step in that process, I have just announced details of an online  questionnaire that can be accessed on the Heritage Council&rsquo;s website. This gives everyone with an interest in the Hill of Tara an immediate opportunity to make their views on its future known. I would urge people to participate, in particular local residents, as the more comments received the more representative the process will be. The consultation phase is intended to be an open and effective way for members of the public to engage in a constructive dialogue on Tara.  The feedback received will be carefully assessed and analysed and will feed into the text of the Plan. As the draft plan evolves, there will be further consultation with all the stakeholders concerned, including with local residents.</p>  <p>  While the development of a plan of this nature is challenging, given the complexity and size of the site and the interests of varied stakeholders, I am confident that it can be completed and adopted in the coming 12 months.</p>  <p>  When finalised, it will form a solid framework in which all of the ongoing site management issues referred to by the Deputy will be addressed.  It will help to inform conservation priorities on the site and guide future investment decisions in visitor and interpretation facilities that are compatible with its international standing and significance.</p></reply>
