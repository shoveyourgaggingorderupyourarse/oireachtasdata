Following the detection, as a precautionary measure, a decision was taken by the Sellafield site management to have only essential workers report for work, while a thorough investigation was completed. Levels of radioactivity subsequently detected were well below that which would call for any further actions to be taken on or off the site. At no stage was there was any risk to the public or to the workforce nor were there any radiological implications for Ireland.   </p><p>  In keeping with agreed protocols, my Department was informed of the elevated detection reading by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change early in the morning of 31 January, with updates received throughout the day. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) was also contacted and kept appraised by its counterparts in the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). Sellafield Ltd subsequently confirmed that the elevated radioactivity levels detected by one of their in-air monitors were not attributable to any issue or problem with any of their operations on-site but were caused by naturally occurring background radon.   </p><p>  As this incident was relatively minor and acknowledging the high level of information sharing between our two Departments, I did not consider it necessary to contact my UK counterpart directly on this occasion. However, I was kept informed by my Department on the status and outcome of the incident.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that the process of selection of Local Development Strategies will include the requirement fully to assess and address the development needs of both Gaeltacht and Island communities. Provision of services through the medium of the Irish language will be compliant with the relevant national legislative framework. </p><p>  The Local and Community Development Programme is the largest social inclusion intervention, of its kind, in the State. The current Programme which operated for four years to the end of 2013, is being implemented by the Local Development Companies on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the implementation of a new Programme in January 2015.  Management of current contracts and Programme oversight will transfer to Local Community Development Committees of the local authorities from 1 July 2014. </p><p>  The Local Community Development Committees are being established in each local authority area over the coming months in line with the provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014. They will bring together both statutory and non-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas. The Committees will have responsibility for community and local development programmes funded by my Department and I am confident that they will bring a strong, strategic focus to their implementation. This implementation will involve local development actors and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally. In the case of the LCDP and in accordance with public procurement rules, the Committees will procure the programme locally, which will have regard to service delivery in both the Gaeltacht and Island areas.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the recoupment, within the overall funding available, of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.</p><p>  In 2010, the Galway City and Western Environs Fire Review Group was established to consider the fire cover in Galway City and Western Environs (South Connemara), as well as the West Connemara Area. The Group finalised its review in June 2013 . Having considered three years of fire incident data, potential changes in demographics and potential permutations of fire stations throughout the whole of the Western Environs Area, the Group reported that there is not a conclusive case for an additional fire station in the Area. The Group recommended a series of Community Safety measures further to reduce the incidence of certain categories of fires which feature in the current low fire risk identified in the Area. I understand that it has reported accordingly to both City and County Councils.</p><p>  Under Section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1981, decision-making on the organisation of fire services and fire stations is a reserved function of fire authorities and I therefore have no function in such decisions, nor has an application for capital funding assistance been received by my Department for a new fire station in South Connemara.</p></reply>

The purpose of the EU Solidarity Fund is to allow Member States to request financial aid in the event of major natural disasters.  There is a damage threshold per Member State which is set at 0.6% of GNI. The estimated costs of damage caused by the storms between 13 December 2013 and 6 January 2014 was &euro;69.5 million. The estimated costs for subsequent damage caused by severe weather from 27 January to 17 February 2014 are currently being collated but indications are that they will not exceed the costs of the damage for the 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 period. These total estimated damage costs are well below the non-negotiable GNI threshold of 0.6% (&euro;770 million in the case of Ireland) of the Solidarity Fund. </p><p>  The possibility of a regional application has also been considered. Article 2 of the Council Regulation for the EU Solidarity Fund provides for such applications under exceptional circumstances. This is subject to a series of impact criteria, including one relating to more than 50% of population of a region being directly affected by a natural disaster. Taking Munster as an example for regional designation purposes, with a population of 1.254 million it would have to be demonstrated that at least 627,000 persons were directly affected. Therefore, the situations which have occurred do not appear to meet these criteria and no application for EU funding is being made.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-12a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031200070#WRA01600"><p>The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement clearly outlines that the priority for Government is to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models. To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments. Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.</p><p>  In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587m, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.  With the benefit of the additional capital for new housing construction, I expect the new social housing construction programme for 2014 - 2015 to deliver close to 700 new social and voluntary homes. A special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses is intended to bring 400 homes back into productive use.</p><p>  The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 to review progress on our <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>, has submitted its first report to me, and this is available on my Department's website. The report considered the supply and access to housing units throughout the country, and the Government has approved  the establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team and an implementation unit, tasked with delivery of its recommendations.  </p><p>  I remain committed to continuing to develop and research innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing.</p></reply>

The working group&rsquo;s report was published on 28 February 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website . </p><p>  The framework for public participation in the Local Government Reform Act 2014 sets out the general principles for formal engagement by local authorities with the community. It will be underpinned by regulations and guidelines from my Department. My Department will now engage with stakeholders, including the Association of County and City Councils and the County and City Managers Association, on the preparation of the regulations and guidelines taking account of the Working Group&rsquo;s report, including the proposal to establish a Public Participation Network in each local authority area.  The regulations will be made as soon as possible, following these consultations.</p><p>  The participation of citizens and communities in local government, and their right to influence decisions that affect them, are at the centre of democracy. I am satisfied that the new Local Government Reform Act 2014 will facilitate local authorities in building more effective and inclusive relationships with all sections of society and that consultation and participation will be at the heart of our local government system.</p></reply>

Local authorities are designated as the &lsquo;lead agency&rsquo; for coordination purposes at local level. Where a situation merits, national level support can be brought to bear and a &lsquo;lead Government Department&rsquo; will lead the coordination of the national level response. The purpose of this is to bring &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; support to bear in assisting the local response if required, to manage the national level issues and to ensure that information is provided to the public.  The procedures and triggers for coordination at national level are set out in <i>&ldquo;Guidelines for Coordinating a National Level Emergency/ Crisis Response&ldquo;</i> , published by the Office of Emergency Planning, Department of Defence, in 2011. This document also sets out the designated lead Government Department for 41 risk scenarios identified for Ireland.</p><p>  As lead Government Department for severe weather, my Department convened and chaired a National Coordination Group on Severe Weather during the recent events on the basis of the Guidelines referred to above. In accordance with standing procedures, all aspects of these latest severe weather events, including response and coordination at national levels, will be reviewed and any lessons identified will be incorporated into future operating procedures.</p></reply>

My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down. </p><p>  Funding is provided only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development. However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive, the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard. </p><p>  Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments where residents are living and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.</p><p>  My Department is currently evaluating SRF proposals from local authorities. I expect that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></reply>

The Board is committed to moving as quickly as possible to the works phase of the remediation process and I understand that it is their intention that this phase will commence in the second half of the year.</p><p>  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with approximately 1,000 dwellings which, it is estimated, are in need of repair. In October 2013 the Government approved initial funding of &euro;10 million for the implementation of the scheme in 2014 and 2015 . Further funding will be provided over the next two years following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and me and in the context of a further capital stimulus package.  It is not possible at this point to look beyond the figure of 1,000 dwellings which may be in need of repair but there are a number of positive indications, including the number of expressions of interest registered with the Pyrite Resolution Board, which suggests that this figure is credible and the number of dwellings requiring remediation may not be as great as initially anticipated. The post-2015 funding requirement will be dealt with at that stage having regard to developments over the interim period.</p><p>  HomeBond is a private company whose operations are governed by company law and which has the same protections in law as are afforded to any other private company; neither I nor my Department have any legal basis under which a levy could be imposed on the funds held by HomeBond.  However, the Pyrite Resolution Board is in discussions with HomeBond with a view to finalising an agreement, shortly, whereby HomeBond will make a non-financial contribution to the remediation process. This will involve making staff available to assist in the provision of certain services to the Board, including testing, project management and other services as agreed; all services will be provided at no cost and will be carried out under the direction and supervision of the Board and/or the Housing Agency.</p></reply>

As also advised in this circular letter, pending further legislation and guidelines in 2014, planning authorities should firstly consult with Irish Water on any proposal to take in charge housing estates where the water services infrastructure would ultimately be transferred to Irish Water under section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.

To achieve this, the Action Programme, together with the Local Government Reform Act 2014, has sought to address the significant weaknesses in the current local government system and set out a realistic and progressive pathway over the coming years to broaden the scope of public service delivery through local government.   </p><p>  Already, a significant enhancement of the local government role is being achieved through the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices to provide the local micro-enterprise support service under legislation currently before the Oireachtas. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 also provides for further significant enhancement of the local government role in economic development at regional and local levels and for alignment of the local and community development sector with local government. </p><p>  In addition, section 45 of the 2014 Act provides for an expansion of the provisions of section 72 of the Local Government Act 2001, to enable the functions of State Bodies, as well as Government Departments, to be devolved to local authorities, subject to prior consent by the relevant Ministers and approval by Government.  It is envisaged that various central government functions, as set out in the Action Programme, will be devolved at an early date , for example in areas such as tourism, ports, national parks, and rural transport.  Devolution will proceed on the basis of assurance that adequate funding, staffing and any other necessary resources will be available to enable local authorities to perform effectively any additional functions. The Action Programme also provides for central retention of existing overall responsibility for policy, funding and accountability where a function transfers to local government.</p><p>  The initial devolution measures will form part of a more substantial long-term widening of the role of local government, as the measures in the reform programme to strengthen the structures, funding, governance and operational efficiency of local government take effect, and the capacity of the system generally increases.</p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years. It is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the roll-out of a new Programme in January 2015.  Management of contracts and Programme oversight will transfer to the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) of the Local Authorities from 1 July next. </p><p>  LCDCs are being established in each local authority area over the coming months in line with the provisions in the recently enacted Local Government Reform Act 2014. These Committees will bring together both statutory and not-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas. The Committees will have responsibility for community and local development programmes funded by my Department and I am confident they will bring a strong, strategic focus to their implementation. </p><p>  This implementation will involve local development actors and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally. In the case of the Local Community Development Programme and in accordance with public procurement rules, the LCDCs will procure the programme locally.  All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified with the tender documentation and the contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of that assessment. While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a procurement process, I expect, given their experience, that LDCs will apply to deliver the programme in their areas.</p></reply>

In the metering contracts, Irish Water has set out standards for employment terms and conditions for workers on the metering project. These provide for rates of pay and conditions of employment, including pension, which are in line with the former Construction Industry Registered Agreements.</p><p>  Irish Water has engaged an auditor, who was selected from a panel put forward by SIPTU, to conduct random audits on metering contractors. Irish Water is satisfied that its contractors are currently compliant with all of the contract terms in relation to pay and conditions (including sick pay, death in service benefit and pensions). The auditing process has identified a low number of incidents of non-compliance. When this has happened, contractors were given a short timeframe to become fully compliant and Irish Water continues to work with the contractors to investigate and rectify any issues. The audit process will remain in place for the duration of the metering programme and any issues identified or raised in relation to contractors will be promptly addressed. </p></reply>

The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness. </p><p>  The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me. The report considered the supply and access to housing units throughout the country. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website, .  On 25 February 2014, the Government approved the establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team and an implementation unit. The team is tasked with implementing the Homelessness Oversight Group's First Report. </p><p>  This will include the preparation and publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from a shelter-led to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness and to achieve the 2016 goals for homelessness. This plan will be a practically focused delivery plan to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation for house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. It will contain actions that will be direct, immediate and solutions based. </p><p>  The implementation team is representative of the key State agencies dealing with homelessness, housing and related services because the solutions to homelessness do not solely reside in my Department. The team is being led by my Department and it includes a senior official from the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive as well as the Managers of Dublin City Council and Monaghan County Council representing local authorities. The team will report on this plan to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy in April 2014 and quarterly thereafter. </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the significant number of families now presenting as homeless in the Dublin region and the extremely challenging situation that this is presenting to Dublin City Council. My Department is working with Dublin City Council on measures to address this emerging situation and the plan will incorporate actions to address this and other accommodation related issues.  I expect that in the region of 5,000 social housing units will be provided in 2014. I am committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing.</p></reply>

In December 2012, I announced an increase in the grant for group sewerage schemes to &euro;6,500 per house or 75% of the cost of the scheme, whichever is the lesser. The previous rate of grant available was &euro;2,031.58 per house or 75% of the cost, whichever was the lesser.  I proposed, in the first instance, to carry out a number of pilot schemes based on the increased grant level. My Department asked local authorities to include in their requests for funding under the 2013 Rural Water Programme proposals for pilot group sewerage schemes which might be viable based on the increased grant.  Following an examination of the proposals received, with particular regard to the environmental justification provided and the estimated costs, I approved grant assistance towards pilot schemes in nine different counties in 2013. A review of progress on the selected pilot schemes will be completed as soon as possible with a view to deciding how best to proceed with the grant scheme.</p></reply>

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis fully to assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions.  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. My Department does not collect statistics in relation to room rental. These proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.</p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages.</p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages , is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. To date, 34 households have availed of the Mortgage to Rent scheme facilitating low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable. In addition, my Department has issued full funding approval under the scheme for a further 51 housing units. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.</p><p>  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, was implemented nationally in recent weeks. With the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, I will be allocating an additional &euro;20m to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) fund in 2014 to significantly expand the capacity of that process to assist households in mortgage distress.</p></reply>

The number of open infringement cases for which my Department is responsible is now reduced to seven, covering issues related to waste, water and waste water, planning and access to justice.  In addition to these open infringement cases, there is only one EU Directive, on waste electrical and electronic equipment, outstanding for transposition from an environmental acquis comprising over 200 major legal acts.  Drafting of the WEEE transposing regulations is being finalised, following consultation with key stakeholders, to ensure its transposition as soon as possible and to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s position among the top Member States in terms of timely transposition of new Directives.</p><p>  In reducing the number of infringements, my Department has addressed compliance issues through, <i>inter alia</i>, a range of primary and secondary legislation across the broad spectrum of environmental areas such as water services, air quality, waste, energy performance in buildings and planning, as well as targeted measures to provide for consistent and transparent implementation of these legislative provisions.  We are also continuing to minimise the risk of new infringements being opened by transposing new Directives within the specified timeframes and by pro-actively engaging with domestic stakeholders to address issues arising before action by the EU Commission becomes necessary.</p><p>EU Legislation falling under the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with which Ireland was non-compliant in March 2011<table><tr><th>EU Instrument <br /><br />Number and General Reference </th><th>Article 258 Letter of <br /><br />Formal Notice </th><th>Article 258 Reasoned Opinion </th><th>Being Referred to the European Court of <br /><br />ustice </th><th>Before the European <br /><br />Court of Justice for a hearing or awaiting judgement </th><th>European Court of <br /><br />Justice Decision to be Implemented </th><th>Article 260 Letter of <br /><br />Formal Notice </th><th>Article 260 Second <br /><br />Letter of Formal Notice </th><th>ECJ request for fines </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>75/442/EEC the waste directive </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>79/409/EEC on wild birds </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1* </td></tr><tr><td>80/68/EEC on groundwater </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>91/271/EEC on urban waste water treatment </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>92/43/EEC on habitats</td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>3* </td></tr><tr><td>96/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2000/60 Water Framework Directive </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2001/42/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2008/50/EC clean air for Europe CAFE </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2008/56/EC establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2008/98/EC Waste Framework Directive </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2008/99/EC on the protection of the environment through criminal law </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>2009/30/EC Fuel Quality </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Articles 43 and 56 of the EU Treaty (Relating to the freedom of establishment &amp;amp; free movement of capital) </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL NUMBER AT EACH STAGE </td><td>8 </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>21 </td></tr></table></p><p>*Responsibility for these cases transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht upon its establishment in May 2011.</p></reply>

It will be the first nation-wide population count in more than 30 years and will be key to the nation's future development, including the forthcoming elections.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has provided technical and financial support to the census preparations over the past 18 months, in partnership with the Ministry of Immigration and Population of Myanmar, to ensure that the census is fully in line with international standards, including how to proceed with the issue of ethnicity. UNFPA has stated that it has received assurances from the Myanmar Government that international norms and standards will be upheld in the carrying out of the census. This will include ensuring respondents have the opportunity during data collection to self-identify their ethnicity, either from the list of 135 official ethnicities, or by describing their own ethnicity. This includes those that wish to identify with mixed-ethnicity.</p><p>  While the reform process in Myanmar/Burma has been moving in the right direction, and key members of the Government of Myanmar/Burma have expressed their commitment to the path of democracy, Ireland together with our EU partners recognise that Myanmar/Burma still faces complex challenges, including in the areas of human rights and democratisation, economic development, peace and reconciliation.  The complexities of ethnic conflict cannot be overstated and the difficulties which exist in this regard in Myanmar are manifold.  Ireland, together with our international partners, will continue to urge the Government to address this issue.</p><p>  At the EU level, the Comprehensive Framework for EU policy and support to Myanmar/Burma, was adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council in July 2013. This urged the Government of Myanmar to pursue and implement durable solutions to the underlying causes of the tensions in Rakhine State and said that solutions for longer-term community reintegration should be pursued, including through the census in 2014. </p><p>  The EU has consistently called on the Government of Myanmar to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence and to guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law.  The EU has specifically called on the Government of Myanmar to address the status and welfare needs of the Rohingya people and to work to prevent any form of violent extremism. The EU has also urged Myanmar to permit the establishment of a country office of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Currently, the EU is providing around &euro;70 million to assist the people of Rakhine state. A large share of this assistance is to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of the region.</p><p>  The EU-Myanmar Taskforce announced at its first meeting in Myanmar in November 2013 that in the coming years (2014-2020), Myanmar is expected to be one of the leading beneficiaries of EU development co-operation in Asia, and will receive around EUR90 million per annum.  Since 2007, over &euro;7 million has been provided by Irish Aid to NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long-term development and emergency and recovery responses in Myanmar. In December 2013, the T&aacute;naiste announced an additional programme of funding worth &euro;500,000. Ireland will continue to monitor developments both bilaterally and multilaterally, including at the Human Rights Council.</p></reply>

When assessing the recent pick-up in house prices it is important to remember that residential property prices fell by just over 50 per cent from peak-to-trough and residential property prices nationally are still 47 per cent lower than at their highest level in September 2007.  Indeed, while much of the attention of late has focused on the Dublin market, prices in the capital are currently 50 per cent lower than at their peak in early 2007.  It is against this background that the recent appreciation in house prices must be assessed.</p><p>   It should also be noted that the previous housing bubble was accompanied by a dramatic increase in mortgage lending.  The same cannot be said of the recent increase in house prices, with indications that a large percentage of transactions are taking the form of cash purchases.  Figures from the Irish Banking Federation show the value of mortgage lending for house purchase in 2013 stood at just &euro;2.4 billion, or just 8 per cent of the value of mortgage lending in 2006.</p><p>  As I outlined in my Budget Day speech, I am conscious that there are some supply limitations in certain urban areas.  In light of this, I introduced several measures to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock as part of Budget 2014.  These included, subject to State Aid approval, the extension of the Living City Initiative, to include Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of eligibility criteria to include all buildings built prior to 1915.</p><p>   More generally, as outlined in the Medium-Term Economic Strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors.  This will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.</p><p>  Finally, I would point out that it is NAMA's expectation, at this juncture, that its funding will contribute about 4,500 houses and apartments in terms of new supply in the Dublin market in the period to 2016.  This is a significant output in the context of current house completion levels in Dublin.  In 2012 just over 1,200 new houses and apartments were completed in Dublin.  In addition, NAMA is overseeing its debtors and receivers who manage the rental of close to 10,000 residential properties nationally mainly apartments in Dublin.  NAMA is also overseeing the sale of houses in Dublin by NAMA debtors and receivers and has made over 1,200 properties available to local authorities to meet demand for social housing in Dublin.</p></reply>

I understand and appreciate their concerns and responded directly.  In Autumn 2013, following a review of its operations by the UK Treasury, RBS reaffirmed its commitment to the Irish market.  As part of that process, Treasury officials engaged with officials from my Department. In February 2014, I met with RBS executives to ascertain their outlook for the bank both here and in the UK. RBS is currently reviewing the operations of Ulster Bank in Ireland with a view to creating a sustainable business model, and on 27 February, RBS re-iterated its commitment to the Irish market.  RBS also stated its intention to build on Ulster Bank's current position to be a compelling challenger bank to the domestic pillar banks and focus firmly on the customer.  It is good news that the bank has committed so firmly to the Irish market and I think it shows significant support for expanding Ulster Bank's presence in the Irish market.   </p><p>  From a domestic banking perspective, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services. It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit - all of which will become increasingly important as the economy recovers.  Officials in the Department of Finance have been in contact with both RBS and Ulster Bank officials and this will continue as the bank finalises its plans for the future.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.  Parents engage tutors directly and the grant is paid to the parent either on a monthly basis in arrears or where possible in advance to assist parents cover the cost of engaging a tutor. This affords a degree of flexibility and choice for parents in selecting the most suitable tutor for the purposes of home tuition for their children.  Parents/Legal guardians approved for the Home Tuition Grant engage tutors for the duration of the approved home tuition scheme on a self-employment basis and are paid directly by the Department into their own bank account and not the account of the tutor. It is then the responsibility of the parent/legal guardian to transfer the fees received to the tutor.</p><p>  The position in the case to which the Deputy refers, is that the self-employed tutor has stated that the parent who received the full home tuition grant has not paid the tutor for the tuition provided. The Department has written regarding this matter to the parent and is awaiting a reply to same. However, as the Department had no role in the payment to this tutor, the matter in dispute is between the parent and the tutor.</p></reply>

The number of whole-school evaluations conducted towards the end of 2012 and in 2013 was reduced somewhat to accommodate advisory visits to schools by inspectors to support the implementation of self-evaluation. Inspectors conducted more than 3,700 such support visits to schools.  The period 2010-2013 was a period of significant reform in the work of the Inspectorate. Substantial changes were made to support the delivery of an effective quality assurance system for Irish schools in the context of reduced staffing numbers in the Inspectorate. Those reforms included the development of new forms of whole-school evaluation at both levels.</p></reply>

For the Deputy's convenience, a list of the major new school and extension projects that were completed nationally in 2012 and 2013 will be forwarded to the Deputy.  The five year School Construction Plan announced on 9 March 2012 (which is also detailed on the website), provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5 billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works.</p><p>  The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction. In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects scheduled to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan (both Plans available on my Department's website). Details of the building projects that are projected to commence construction in 2014 will be announced later this year.</p><p>  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package announced earlier this year, 28 school projects that were not contained in the 5 year programme but have completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction. A project for a replacement school in County Kildare is included in this package.  The Deputy will be aware that under the Prefab Replacement Initiative 2012, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative. In June 2013, I announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/2014 for this purpose. Forty-six schools, with 115 prefab units, will be offered grants to provide the new facilities. Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The Plan will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement on 7th November of an additional &euro;70 million for school improvement works. This comprises a once-off payment of over &euro;28 million to primary schools as part of the Minor Works Scheme and a further &euro;40 million to facilitate the re-introduction of the Summer Works Scheme for 2014.  In addition, there were 823 applications for devolved funding for the provision of additional accommodation in 2012 and 2013. 595 applications were successful details of which may be viewed on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The Examiner has not yet concluded this process. It should be noted that as Examinership is a judicial process, I have no function as Minister.</p><p>  Examinership is the main debt restructuring system for companies in Ireland and has been in existence since 1990.  Examinership allows for the rescue of companies that find themselves insolvent but have the potential to return to financial viability and continue in operation into the future.  The key feature of the process is a period of court protection, lasting up to 100 days, during which no one may institute proceedings against the company or petition for the company to be wound up.  The Examiner uses this time to devise a scheme of arrangement, in consultation with creditors, the company management, potential investors and any other parties that would be affected by that scheme.  The scheme of arrangement is then put to the court. If a majority of the company&rsquo;s creditors agree and the court approves, it becomes binding.</p><p>  I believe that Examinership is a good option for companies that have real prospects for the future but find themselves in financial difficulty at a point in time.  It is also a balanced procedure, taking into account both the interests of the ailing company and the rights of the creditors, and giving the courts a role in ensuring a fair and appropriate outcome.</p><p>  For that reason, the Oireachtas enacted the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 late last year, to allow small private companies to apply for Examinership directly in the Circuit Court, rather than having to go first to the High Court.  I hope that this will make Examinership an option for more companies in the future.  In the meantime, I am keeping the law on Examinership under review to identify if there are any other ways in which we can make it less costly.</p></reply>

Another pensioner with an average of 21 contributions would be entitled to the same personal rate, as they would both be in the same band. This would apply both to pensioners born on 31 December 1947 and 1 January 1948.   While both might be entitled to increases in respect of qualified adults and/or children, it would not appear that either individual would qualify for a State pension (contributory), based on his or her PRSI contributions, at a rate of &euro;225 weekly.  It may be, therefore, that the latter rate of payment is a means-tested one, rather than one based on his or her PRSI record.</p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to State pension, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing whether they are entitled to a State pension, and the level of any such entitlement.</p><p>  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension.</p><p>  To qualify for a state pension a person must:</p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions and</p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate pension, and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).</p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced. The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.</p><p>  The rates of State pension paid were more closely linked to the number of contributions paid in Budget 2012.   Under the pension reform programme, it is planned to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will closely reflect the rate of payment received.  For example, 30 years contributions (1,560) could qualify a person for maximum State pension (contributory). A person would accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30/30ths inclusive of a certain number of credits.   It had been planned to introduce this change in 2020 but in the context of changing demographics and longer working, this date may change.</p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System which was published in April 2013 also endorsed the move to a total rather than an average contributions test to determine entitlement to a State pension.</p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is a means tested payment, may be made in respect of an individual who does not qualify for a pension in their own right or qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in insurance. It may also be the case that a means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria for that payment.</p></reply>

The role of the CWS and the objectives of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme which they administer are compatible with the goals and objectives of this Department having regard to income support, social inclusion and integration of services. The need for a flexible and responsive approach to meet the needs of members of the public experiencing disadvantage continues to remain central to the CWS.</p><p>  When a clinic is closed, an increased level of service is made available to the customers at alternative locations in the general vicinity. The change is a move away from the traditional model of one officer serving an individual location and delivering the full range of community welfare services, towards a sustainable team-based approach which is more efficient, effective and economical. The new arrangements have enhanced service provision, lead to greater value for money in terms of savings in respect of costs such as rent and have facilitated an improved utilisation of staff resources.</p><p>  Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service. In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved and enhanced phone service and dedicated email addresses are available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel to the clinic.  Customers in affected areas are encouraged to contact the service by phone, email or post in the first instance and in most cases their queries can be answered without them having to attend a public clinic. If a face to face meeting is still necessary, but the customer is unable to travel to the public clinic an officer will arrange a visit to the customer&rsquo;s home.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s services are continually monitored and kept under review by management taking account of the views of staff, public representatives and users of the service to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service. I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department. It is therefore essential that the services provided are reconstituted to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p></reply>

The initiative aims to improve the employability and maintain the work readiness of those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more.  Both T&uacute;s and Community Employment (CE) also focus on those who are long-term unemployed with the aim of improving their employability.</p><p>  I consider participation on T&uacute;s and CE to be adequate to meet the objectives of the schemes, whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit.

We have focused Gateway at those who are longer away from the labour market and who have skills predominately in the construction sector.

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short provides for a number of levels of identity authentication.  An individual&rsquo;s SAFE level is determined by the degree of assurance that can be provided as to his or her identity.</p><p>  SAFE also provides for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort.  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature, the verification of identity and current address as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions to be used in ensuring the future integrity of customers&rsquo; data. </p><p>  At present certain cohorts of the Department&rsquo;s customers are being invited by letter to a Face-to-Face registration.  These include people applying for, or in receipt of, social protection payments or benefits, including Jobseeker payments, Free Travel entitlement, Child Benefits payments, State Pensions, and One Parent Family payments.  The Department recognises that not all persons will be able to attend at a PSC registration centre and for that reason the invitation letter which issues asks customers to make contact with the Department if they have any special requirements, or are unable to attend the appointment.  The provision of mobile SAFE registration facilities to facilitate such persons is currently being examined.</p><p>  In the case mentioned by the Deputy, a letter was sent inviting the person to attend for registration.  He telephoned on 18 February and left a message asking to be contacted to make arrangements to attend.  Messages are dealt with in the order they are received, and because of the large volume of calls received at that time, his call was not replied to until 25 February.  At that time, several attempts were made to contact the person on his mobile phone, but the calls were not answered.  Attempts were also made at that time to contact him on different phone numbers which the Department has on record for him, but these were also unsuccessful.  A reminder letter subsequently issued to him. </p><p>  He has now been contacted and a new appointment made and the arrangements that he has requested to facilitate him, have been put in place.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. </p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing people in sourcing accommodation and the latest Daft.ie rental report indicates that the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013.  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin. </p><p>  However, the fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement, of which almost 30,000 are in the Dublin area, shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants on the scheme.  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).

Due to the number of different technology systems  currently in use it would be a major exercise to develop a tracking system as described.</p><p>  Over the past number of years extensive investment has been made in new technology and a high proportion of our customers claims are now processed and paid via new systems.  In respect of these claims the customer is issued with a text acknowledgement on receipt of the customer claim, where they provide a mobile telephone number.  However, it is not intended to retrofit this solution to claims processed on older systems, as it would not be cost effective to do so. </p><p>  Efficient and prompt processing of all customer claims remains a key priority for the department.  Claim processing standards are regularly reviewed and the target achieved in each scheme area is published to inform customers of the likely time required to process individual claims.  In some schemes, customers have their claims processed and paid within one to two weeks and in such cases developing and maintaining a tracking system would possibly slow the process.  I am satisfied that the processes in place to manage applications and to keep customers informed are appropriate and that customer service is kept under continual review to ensure the best possible service is provided to the Department&rsquo;s customers.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>-  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>-  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100 Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200 Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services and is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

This entirely commercial transaction is underway and neither I nor officials at my Department are involved in it. State owned Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) sold the Whitegate refinery and Whiddy Island oil storage facilities to a private firm called Tosco Corporation in 2001. A key element in the transaction was Tosco Corporation&rsquo;s undertaking to operate the two facilities (the Whitegate refinery and Bantry (Whiddy Island) storage terminal) for at least 15 years (until mid-2016) on a commercial basis. This condition also applies to any subsequent purchasers of the assets during the period. The ownership of the facilities has changed a number of times since 2001 without impacting operations.</p><p>  Last July, I published a study commissioned by my Department into the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the island of Ireland. The study found that the existing oil import facilities on the island of Ireland taken as a whole offer a robust infrastructure that could provide comfortable alternatives in the event of a serious disruption at any of the six principal oil ports. They could supply the total oil demand, regardless of any future decisions on the operation of Whitegate as either a refinery or terminal. The development of the Irish motorway network has been significant in improving oil security of supply in recent years, facilitating the transport of oil from key ports throughout the island of Ireland. Work with counterparts in Northern Ireland is ongoing with a view to enhancing contingency planning on the island. </p><p>  I outlined last July that the Government&rsquo;s primary conclusion on the strategic case for oil refining is that the presence of an operational refinery on the island of Ireland provides flexibility, enhancing the options available to the State in the event of an oil supply disruption, by providing an alternative source of product thus mitigating a complete reliance on product imports. </p><p>  Despite energy efficiency advances and an increase in the penetration of renewable energy, Ireland is expected to remain dependent on oil into the medium term, particularly for transport. As such, the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis is highly desirable from an oil and energy security of supply perspective. The study concludes and the Government also acknowledges and recognises that an operating refinery also adds value to the Irish economy and provides significant employment.</p><p>  I further outlined that in light of our primary conclusion, the Government had agreed that my Department should liaise with the Irish oil industry and appropriate public bodies to determine available policy options that might facilitate the commercial future of refining in Ireland. The consideration of available policy options to support the commercial future of refining in Ireland is ongoing and is equally valid irrespective of any possible change in asset ownership.</p></reply>

These provide for rates of pay and conditions of employment, including pension, which are in line with the former Construction Industry Registered Agreements.</p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it has engaged an auditor to conduct random audits on metering contractors.  Irish Water is satisfied that its contractors are currently compliant with all of the contract terms in relation to pay and conditions (including sick pay, death in service benefit and pensions).  Its auditing process has identified a low number of incidents of non-compliance.  When this has happened, contractors were given a short timeframe to become fully compliant and Irish Water continues to work with the contractors to investigate and rectify any issues.

The SRF has been introduced to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014.  There has been a significant level of interest across local authorities.  Kildare County Council submitted an SRF application in respect of 4 housing developments.  My Department is currently evaluating all SRF proposals and I anticipate that funding allocations will be approved in the very near future.  I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015.  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers. </p><p>  The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014.  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for a free allowance.   </p><p>  The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply.  The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households.  Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER.  I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly. </p></reply>

Some 27,407 units, including those delivered in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &ndash; 2008, were delivered through a construction programme with a further 8,149 units acquired through the purchase of built properties.   </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement clearly outlines that the priority for Government is to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models. To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments. Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  </p><p>  In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587m, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.   </p><p>  With the benefit of the additional capital for new housing construction, I expect the new social housing construction programme for 2014 - 2015 to deliver close to 700 new social and voluntary homes. A special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses is intended to bring 400 homes back into productive use.

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website </p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a stand alone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions. Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review. </p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages.  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.</p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. To date, 34 households have availed of the scheme.  In addition, my Department has issued full funding approval under the scheme for a further 51 housing units. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. </p><p>  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, was implemented nationally in recent weeks. With the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, I will be allocating an additional &euro;20m to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) fund in 2014 to significantly expand the capacity of that resource to assist local authority borrowers in mortgage distress.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, within this period, it is open to the dwelling owner, with the consent of the planning authority, to sell the house to another person who would satisfy the local need criteria for the area. The Guidelines also recommend that such conditions shall not affect the sale of a dwelling by a mortgagee in possession or by any person deriving title from such a sale to facilitate the sale of property by lending institutions in circumstances relating to a loan foreclosure.</p><p>  While the enforcement of such planning conditions is a matter for each planning authority, having regard to national policy, I understand that planning authorities consider requests for non-enforcement of occupancy conditions on a case-by-case basis from dwelling owners who may find themselves in &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; situations similar to the above, such as marital breakdown or emigration, and which require the sale of their dwelling.</p></reply>

Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process. </p><p>  Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process. This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>  Legislative reform in the area of protection remains a key priority.  Work on a new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which remains part of the Government's Legislative Programme, is being advanced to enable publication later this year.  The Bill will provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion.</p><p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The Direct Provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State in providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is under financial difficulty.</p><p>  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly over the last five years. At the end of December, 2013 there were 4,360 residents in direct provision compared with 6,494 at the end of December, 2009. This represents a reduction of 2,134, or 33%, in the number of residents in direct provision in that period. Compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), there has been a reduction of 46% or 3, 720 persons in the intervening nine years.  </p><p>  A comprehensive review of the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -<i> &quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; </i>  - which was published in May 2010, found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system.  No Government can afford to ignore the likely consequences of any change to the Direct Provision system.  The system cannot exist solely in its own context.  It is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process.  By its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  The time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings also impacts on the length of the process.  A substantial proportion of cases in the High Court relate to judicial review proceedings taken or decisions reached in the international protection arena.</p></reply>

At the end of 2013, RIA was accommodating 4,360 persons, a decrease of 481 residents (10%) over 2012.  This was the 5th straight decline in a row. There has been an overall decline of 37% (2,642 persons) in the period end December 2008 to end December 2013 in the numbers being accommodated by RIA.</p><p>  In order to meet its international obligations in the area of asylum, the Government has allocated significant resources over the years to our asylum determination structures, to reception arrangements and to the provision of services to asylum seekers. Ireland is not unique in this respect.  I have outlined in previous responses to D&aacute;il questions the origin and purpose of the direct provision system, by which the State discharges its obligations to provide for the basic requirements of asylum seekers.  The system allows the State to ensure that a suitable standard of accommodation, food and ancillary services are provided to asylum seekers resident in the State.  The system is based on the principle of mainstream service provision so that residents receive the health and education services as Irish citizens. Dispersal ensures that the pressure on health, welfare, education and other services is evenly distributed to allow an efficient management of resources in those areas.The policy of direct provision and dispersal is one of the central features of the State's asylum system and the need for the system remains. </p><p>   I am satisfied that the human rights of asylum seekers are respected in the direct provision system. Asylum seekers receive nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population.  Asylum seekers receive a health service, including mental health services, on the same basis as Irish citizens and it is, in many cases,  far superior to what is available in their countries of origin. Children of asylum seekers are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.  </p><p>  Over the years, the system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies. Within the RIA system, there are  policies and procedures to ensure that the rights of residents are respected and protected.</p><p>  The House Rules set out the rights and obligations on residents and management and how each could engage in a complaints mechanism in the event that the other failed in their obligations. Generally, the thrust of the Rules is that problems are resolved quickly and &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; rather than resorting to written complaints. Residents can put their complaints in writing and, if unresolved, can be referred upwards to RIA. In certain cases, a first instance complaint can be made directly to RIA. RIA holds a minimum of three &lsquo;one to one&rsquo; clinics every year in centres where residents can discuss issues directly with RIA staff without management being present. RIA has a Code of Practise for persons working in asylum accommodation centres.</p><p>  RIA has an inspections process, involving three unannounced inspections of centres each year - two by internal RIA staff and one by an external inspection company.  Inspections which have taken place from 1 October, 2013, are now being published on RIA's website - www.ria.gov.ie. RIA has a comprehensive Child Protection Policy. An updated, more 'user friendly' policy is being finalised and will be implemented later this year.</p><p>  In the next few weeks it is expected that a Sexual harassment and Domestic Violence policy will be agreed between RIA and NGO&rsquo;s such as AkidWa and Ruhama and the UNHCR. This policy will then be implemented and will involve a training programme for staff and residents.</p><p>  Finally, NGO groups as well as many State service providers engage on a daily basis with residents in the direct provision system, all of whom would seek to ensure that residents' basic human rights continue to be respected.</p></reply>

The remaining &euro;4 million has been made available for the purchase and fit out of Garda vehicles in 2014.

This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. </p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach, most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  In September 2012, a working group was established to undertake an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group.  This review is examining all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies and the Group is expected to report in the next few months.  In addition, in June 2013, the Law Reform Commission published a report on mandatory sentences.  The recommendations contained in that report will be considered together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

Overall in 2013, approximately 166,000 new applications (i.e. visa, residence, protection and citizenship) were received by INIS and decisions were issued in almost 177,000 cases. In addition, some 97,000 new or renewed registrations of permission to remain in the State were issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Furthermore, the public offices of INIS and the Garda National Immigration Bureau receive in the region of 130,000 persons annually in respect of registration of non-EEA persons residing in the State and applicants seeking re-entry visas as well as callers seeking information or for other business.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate from the above mentioned figures that the volume of applications dealt with by INIS is considerable. These comprise a broad range of application categories most of which are hugely complex and all of which are subject to oversight by the courts and have to be processed in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. Therefore, due to the diverse and complex nature of applications processed by INIS, it very difficult to provide applicants with the precise status of their application at any given point in time. In many cases communication takes place through the applicant's legal advisor. However, where possible applicants are provided with as much information as is available and in some areas where it has been feasible tracking services appropriate to the type of application have been implemented.</p><p>  In relation to visa applications which account for 90,000 applications, for example, such a service is already in place as part of the online application and tracking system known as AVATS (Automated Visa Application and Tracking System).  Applicants are provided with a unique application number on completion of the online application form which can then be used to track progress on the application through the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service .</p><p>  In the area of citizenship, when an application for a certificate of naturalisation is received, an acknowledgement letter is issued and applicants are also informed when their application successfully progresses to further stages of the process. Further letters are issued where additional information is required and, once all of the required information is received, the case is submitted to me for decision. Applicants are then informed of my decision on their application.</p><p>  In other areas, for example general information on the expected timescale for processing applications is provided indicating the specific month of applications currently being processed. This provides a good indication to the applicant as to when their application will be dealt with. It should also be noted that INIS operates a number of helplines to provide information and advice to customers and the contact details and operating hours are published on the INIS website.</p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree the main priority for INIS must continue to be the processing of cases as expeditiously as possible and, accordingly, the right balance must be found between providing application status information to applicants and the efficient processing of applications. That said, INIS is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to its applicants and the development of enhanced online immigration services generally is currently under review.   </p></reply>

The level of funding being provided to these organisations has been increased for the third year in a row, reflecting the importance I attach to their work. I specifically increased funding to those organisations involved in horse welfare activities to ensure that they have sufficient resources to enable them cater for any difficulties arising in the area of horse welfare over the coming year.

Implementation of this scheme was completed in August 2006 because of an obligation imposed by the European Commission on Ireland to complete the licensing and registration of eligible vessels under the scheme at the earliest possible date, as part of a process of finalising the fishing fleet capacity limits of all Member States.  Ireland received a credit of 1,239 gross tonnes and 15,955 kilowatts in its reference level (i.e. fleet capacity ceiling) in respect of these vessels.  The scheme is now closed.</p><p>  There were a number of necessary conditions attached to licensing of vessels in the Polyvalent Potting sub-segment of the fleet.  Vessels may only target non-quota species and exclusively by means of pots.  Neither the boat's capacity nor its licence may be traded on or otherwise transferred, except to an immediate family member (i.e. father, mother, brother, sister, spouse or child).  A licence is permanently lost to the holder once the potting vessel is removed from the Fishing Boat Register.  The loss can only be avoided if a replacement vessel is proposed in advance of the existing potting vessel being removed from the Fishing Boat Register.  While this has given rise over time to some unused capacity, it is small amount.  I have no plans at this time to make this capacity available to additional vessels.  The general position is that most inshore stocks are under significant pressure and most commentary on the inshore sector is looking for a decrease rather than an increase in fishing effort. However, I will consider it in the context of the action plan for small scale coastal fishing vessels required as part of the preparation of the Operational Programme for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p><p>  In the meantime, any new applications for potting licences are subject to standard licensing conditions under current licensing policy, including the requirement for the provision of replacement capacity.  A Polyvalent General licence is required by new applicants to fish by means of pots but such licences are not restricted to fishing by means of pots only.</p></reply>

My response was based on the information on fleet activity available to my Department, which is derived from the EU vessel monitoring systems fitted to fishing vessels over 12 metres.  There is no equivalent real time means of monitoring the activity of smaller inshore vessels.  However, I am conscious that such smaller vessels are even more weather dependent than the fleet generally.  Informal reports from local officers from the agencies of my Department indicate to me that there was very limited fishing by the under 10 metre fleet during February, and I heard similar advice from many inshore fishermen at the recent Expo in Galway.  I understand that in the present spell of fine weather these vessels are now returning to potting for lobster and crab.</p><p>  I also advised the Deputy in my response on 27 February that the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  That remains the case.</p><p>  In addition, I advised the Deputy of the &euro;8.8 million made available by Government to repair in excess of 100 piers, harbours and slipways linked to fisheries and aquaculture and the &euro;1.5 million to assist small inshore fishermen with the cost of replacing pots lost on the storms.  These are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with the impact of the adverse weather in the early months of this year.</p></reply>

Early indications suggest however that less than 1% of the forest area and approximately 1% of the forest volume was blown down in the storm of 12 February.  Whilst direct financial support is not being provided to those whose forestry was destroyed in the storm, a taskforce, chaired by Mr Tom Hayes TD, Minister of State, has been established to assess the damage nationally and to quickly identify the various issues arising as a result of this severe windblow event and to agree on a course of actions to deal with these issues.  The taskforce has issued a guidance note for forest owners, laying down the steps to consider in safely harvesting and selling the fallen trees and giving advice on a range of other associated issues.</p><p>  Teagasc forestry advisers are available to meet any forest owner in the Teagasc Office for advice.  Forest owners are also urged to get professional advice from qualified foresters to guide them through this process. Furthermore, the Forest Service of my Department is also ready to facilitate those wishing to apply for felling licences to deal with the situation in the most appropriate manner. In this regard I would urge forest owners to mark their application &lsquo;Storm Damage&rsquo; to allow it to be prioritised by the Forest Service.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation, which I expect to be published shortly.  </p><p>  A draft contract for the provision of free GP care to children under 6 years, is currently the subject of a consultation process.  I would wish to emphasise that the document is a draft and I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text following the consultation process.  I have offered to meet with the GP organisations in the coming weeks for more detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract.  This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contract.</p><p>  On 27 February 2014, I wrote to the IMO stating that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  However, the ultimate setting of fees must remain a matter for the Minister for Health, though there will be an opportunity for their input on the fee structure, which it is proposed to address by means of a separate consultation process.  The IMO has been formally invited to meet with the Department and the HSE to commence this process.</p><p>  With reference to the question which infers that the draft contract is placing a &ldquo;gagging order&rdquo; on GPs, the specific clause in the draft contract relating to this (Clause 28.4.4) is intended to reflect and be protective of the HSE's interests given that the primary statutory obligations to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services will rest with the HSE.  It is not in any sense intended to impose unwarranted or inappropriate restrictions on individual GP contractors in advocating on behalf of their patients.</p><p>  A similar clause can be found in the form of agreement with Clinical Dental Technicians, which was introduced in 2011.  The clause in question should be viewed in the context of the entire draft document, where the intent is to balance the duties, obligations and rights of both parties, while at the same time, having due regard to the overriding statutory obligations that will rest with the HSE.</p><p>  The obligations set out in the draft contract relating to the inspection of records by the HSE are a standard feature of most contracts for the provision of health and social services on behalf of the HSE.  Among the circumstances in which they might need to be invoked would be where patient safety concerns arise; where concerns exist about the quality of services being provided; in processing complaints from patients/relatives; and for probity assurance purposes.  In exercising a provision of this nature, the HSE would be obliged to have due regard to patient confidentiality considerations, the need for patient consent and applicable legislative obligations.</p><p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about a change of policy in relation to a return to domiciliary visits, I would emphasise that it is a matter for each individual doctor to determine whether their patient requires a domiciliary visit or not.  Doctors must always be guided by their primary responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients.</p><p>  The Deputies' questions raise a number of other specific issues, such as periodic wellness assessments; health surveillance and protection activities; and the collation of information for epidemiological purposes.  Such activities will ensure that the proposed scope of service under the contract is not limited to &ldquo;diagnosis and treatment&rdquo; but will include participation in active health promotion, disease surveillance, prevention and appropriate management of chronic conditions.  However, I expect that issues such as these will be the subject of further discussions with the GPs.</p></reply>

The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007. In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) is expected to commence shortly.</p></reply>

The consultation process ran from Tuesday 4 February until Friday 7 March 2014. As of Monday 10 February the Department had received a total of 55 submissions to the consultation. The Department wished to have views on the draft General Scheme and welcomed the comments of individuals, institutions, agencies, organisations, and groups on the issue.  The Department placed advertisements in the national press on Thursday 6 February requesting written submissions to the consultation and a press release relating to the consultation was also circulated to media outlets.  A number of stakeholder organisations representing a range of different fields (e.g. medicine, law, health advocacy, disability, mental health, and older people and aging) were contacted directly and invited to make a submission to the consultation.</p><p>  The Department established a dedicated webpage for this consultation process ().  This webpage provided an overview of the consultation process, including a copy of the draft General Scheme of the advance healthcare directive provisions and a discussion document which summarised the draft General Scheme and outlined some structured questions to help interested parties focus their submissions.  Submissions could be returned by post, to the Bioethics Unit in the Department, or via email to the dedicated email address set up for the consultation: .  The Department will publish a summary of the submissions received as part of this public consultation on its website in the coming months.</p><p>  In addition, during the period of the consultation process, the Irish Hospice Foundation&rsquo;s Forum on End of Life in Ireland held a public meeting in relation to the draft General Scheme on Thursday 27 February. The Department&rsquo;s Chief Bioethics Officer gave a presentation at this event and provided an overview of the draft legislative provisions for advance healthcare directives.  Following the consultation process the advance healthcare directive provisions are to be incorporated into the <i>Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill</i>   at Committee Stage, in line with a Government decision from 2013. It is envisaged that the Bill will be brought to Committee Stage in the coming months.</p></reply>

Sponsorship details follow the reply.</p><p>  In 2012, to ensure value for money, my Department and the DHSSPS carried out reviews of the role and responsibilities of the FSPB and its interaction with other organisations working in the food safety, diet and nutrition areas in their respective jurisdictions. These provided the basis for enhanced communications structures between the organisations, helped clarify the role of the FSPB and informed their Business Planning process.</p><p>  The FSPB adopts a value-for-money approach to all its activities and best practice corporate governance is applied. Their annual Business Plan is examined by both sponsor Departments and the respective Finance Departments, and then approved by the North/South Ministerial Council. Between 2011 and 2013, savings of 9% have been achieved and measures designed to achieve annual efficiency savings of 4% from 2014 to 2016 are in place.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Organisation Name</th><th>Name of Campaign</th><th>Safeguards put in place by the Minister re VFM</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Childhood Obesity Campaign</td><td>The campaign is being run in partnership between the Department, Safefood and the HSE and officials from both the Department and the HSE are on the working group delivering and overseeing the campaign</td><td>The total cost of the current phase of the campaign is &euro;1.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Operation Transformation</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS)</td><td>1,466,240</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Operation Transformation</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>274,259</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Food Waste</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>835,498</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Stop the Spread</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>614,670</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Food Hygiene</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>898,029</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Food Waste</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>540,714</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Operation Transformation</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>186,346</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Weigh2Live</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>245,222</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Food Hygiene</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>609,913</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Safefood</td><td>Operation Transformation</td><td>Business Planning/Corporate Planning Process and Review by both DoH and DHSSPS</td><td>211,740</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of healthcare delivery. A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and the recipients of blood and blood products. </p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] from donating blood is not based on sexuality or orientation but on the fact that there are increased levels of HIV infection among men who have sex with men in Ireland.  While testing for HIV is very sensitive and effective, there remains a period between infection and detection that could cause the transmission of HIV to a recipient of blood or blood components.  The IBTS works closely with blood services internationally and keeps developments in this area under review.</p></reply>

The guidelines include a description of the documentary evidence that an applicant must provide in relation to each income type that the applicant, and his/her dependants, receives. The National Assessment Guidelines state that, for the purposes of an assessment of eligibility for a medical card/GP visit card, a person in receipt of an income from self employment must provide either:</p><p>  - a Revenue Notice of Assessment as proof of income from this source, <b><i>or</i></b> if Revenue has determined that an income return for tax purposes is not necessary, </p><p>  - a Non Liable Notification Letter issued by Revenue in addition to a statement of the amount of income being received from this source.</p><p>  A  &ldquo;Non Liable Notification Letter&rdquo; will typically issue by Revenue in cases where a very low income is being returned from the self-employment activity concerned. Such determination can only be made by Revenue when an income return is made to Revenue and they conduct an assessment of tax liability based on the return.  For assistance with completing this form,<b></b>the<b></b>local offices of the Revenue Commissioners can be contacted or the website  accessed.</p><p>  The HSE local health offices can offer assistance to those completing their Medical Card/GP Visit Card application form or seek clarification on any aspect regarding the process of assessing eligibility for a Medical Card/GP Visit Card. In addition, in this regard, a help and information <b>Callsave phone line 1890 252 919</b> is available to the public. It is advised that applicants should avail of this information helpline, where they have concerns regarding assessments and review. The HSE will give every assistance to persons that contact our offices, in advising and facilitating them in meeting the requirements to have their eligibility for a Medical Card/GP Visit Card fully assessed. If a person, the subject of a review assessment is engaging with our offices and has undertaken to provide the information being requested within period of time that is reasonable and agreed with the HSE, the HSE will extend that person&rsquo;s medical card eligibility for the period agreed to allow the applicant time to provide the information required and allow an assessment be conducted based on this information.</p></reply>
