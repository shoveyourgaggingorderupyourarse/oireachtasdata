    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-06a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100600067#WRA00400"><p>On March 23rd 2018 the Director of Corporate Enforcement applied to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors to Independent News and Media (INM) on the 23 March 2018, pursuant to section 748 of the Companies Act 2014.  </p>  <p>  The Director&rsquo;s application for the appointment of inspectors followed a lengthy and wide-ranging investigation that identified several issues of serious concern relating to INM. That investigation was initiated on foot of a protected disclosure made to the ODCE.</p>  <p>  Following his judgement of 4 September 2018, the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, on September 6th 2018, ordered, pursuant to section 748 of the Companies Act 2014, the appointment of inspectors to INM. The Court appointed inspectors are Mr. Sean Gillane, SC and Mr. Richard Fleck, CBE. The inspectors were appointed to investigate the various matters set out in their Terms of Reference as set out in the Order of the President of the High Court. This work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Section 949(3) of the Companies Act 2014 provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall be independent in the performance of his statutory functions. I as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have no function in such matters.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the engagement between my officials and the ODCE on this matter has been very limited and relates only to the issue of indemnity.</p>  <p>  Arising from certain issues relating to the ODCE&rsquo;s investigation into INM,  my officials engaged with the Director of Corporate Enforcement and put in place a legal indemnity in respect of the Director&rsquo;s statutory functions. My officials have also engaged with the Court appointed inspectors to put in place a legal indemnity in respect of their duties as inspectors to INM.</p>  <p>  As I outlined to the House on 17 April 2018, I consider that any public servant who acts properly and in accordance with his mandate and does not breach any laws or ethical principles should be indemnified by the State.  </p></reply>

The lists are reviewed twice a year to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements.  A current review of the occupations lists for employment permits is well underway with submissions received from a range of sectors under active consideration.  It is expected that the review will be finalised in the coming weeks and any changes necessary to deal with verified skills or labour shortages will be made at that time.</p></reply>

There is a further commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a longer-term plan to utilize the potential 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters.    The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of offshore renewable energy (ORE)Â in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid. </p>  <p>  Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of stronger and more consistent wind speeds, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology.</p>  <p>  Development of the Maritime Area Planning Bill (MAP)Â Bill is being led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with my Department providing input on provisions specific to ORE.The enactment ofÂ this BillÂ will provide a modern, up-to-date regulatory framework that will enable ORE developments beyond the limits of the current foreshore regime, including off the west coast. </p>  <p>  Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan has also been initiated by my Department. ThisÂ will provide an evidence base for the assessment of areas most suitable forÂ the sustainable developmentÂ of wind, wave, and tidal technologies, in consultation with other maritime users.</p></reply>

There are a number of these schemes operating in Ireland and they have proved very successful in enabling us meet domestic and EU recycling targets. The EPR scheme for farm plasticsÂ has been in place since 1998 andÂ has grown significantly since then.Â The existing arrangements are functioning very effectively and the targets in place are being achieved, with a recycling rate for 2020 reaching 80% significantly exceeding the target of 70%.   The regulations allow for any organisation to apply to the Minister forÂ approval to operate a scheme. Any application will be assessed and evaluated by the Department. There is currently one approved body operating a farm plastic scheme, Irish Farm Film Plastics Group (IFFPG). Their approval was renewed earlier this year following a lengthyÂ process and the renewal will last for a five year period, subject to periodic reviews.Â </p>  <p>  The current funding mechanisms used by IFFPG for farm plastic collection is in line with the polluter pays principle and EU requirements, with producers funding 70% of the necessary costs of the scheme and farmers contributing the remainingÂ  30% of the costs. The fees collectedÂ are used by the operator to fund the operational costs of the scheme which is run on a not for profit basis. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have a key role in ensuring compliance with the farm plastics regulations and broader waste legislation obligations. The Department supports local authorities taking appropriate enforcement action against individuals or corporate entitiesÂ through the appropriate channels.Â The Department is also aware that the National Trans Frontier Shipment Office (NTFSO) are liaising with a number of local authorities to ascertain the extent of the storage of farm plastics and the implications for waste shipments abroad.Â Â An effective system of waste management compliance is critical to the welfare of the environment and society in general.</p></reply>

MetroLink is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State. </p><p>Both face imminent and important milestones in the coming months which will determine the progress of each in the coming years. </p><p><i>Firstly</i>, there is Government&rsquo;s approval of the Preliminary Business Case and <i>secondly</i>there is the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>On that first milestone, my Department has received Preliminary Business Cases for both. This represents Decision Gate 1 under the <i>Public Spending Code</i>and those Preliminary Business Cases are currently under review. For major projects, like DART+ and MetroLink, the <i>Public Spending Code</i>requires a Government decision and I expect to seek such a Government decision in the near future. </p><p>If approved by Government, that will allow the contracts to be signed in relation to DART+ Fleet and will also allow MetroLink and DART+ West move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation.</p><p>The second impending milestone is the submission of Railway Order applications for DART+ West and MetroLink. Those applications require the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports, and that work is ongoing in relation to both projects. </p><p>On MetroLink I understand that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues. This should be completed during Q1 next year and, subject to the Government decision mentioned above, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission. </p><p>On DART+, the most advanced of the proposed infrastructure projects is DART+ West. The second round of public consultation on DART+ West has recently been extended until early October, today in fact.  Issues raised during this consultation process, including those raised by public representatives, will need to be fully considered and appropriately addressed before they&rsquo;re ready to enter the planning system. Once that has been completed, and similar to MetroLink, DART+ West can then move into the planning system subject to the aforementioned Government approval and finalisation of planning documentation. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the current position.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. The AIB Relationship Framework can be accessed on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  With regards to the AIB branch the Deputy has referred to, officials in my Department have been provided with the following update from AIB:</p>  <p>  "The AIB branch in Rathkeale, Co. Limerick is not closing. While the branch will no longer offer over the counter cash services, the team in Rathkeale will continue to personally support and advise their customers on their financial needs, be it account opening, mortgages, business or personal loans or financial planning. The branch remains open Monday from 10am &ndash; 5pm and Tuesday &ndash; Friday from 10am to 4pm. </p>  <p>Through AIB&rsquo;s partnership with An Post, our customers can continue to conduct the vast majority of their day to day banking transactions through their local post office, located on Thomas Street, Rathkeale. These services, available to Personal and Business customers, include cash withdrawal, cash and coin lodgements. More banking services will become available in the Post Office from November 29th  , including an 'off counter' facility for business customers to enable faster lodgements. These services are listed below and the Post Office has longer opening hours than the AIB branch, including Saturday opening.</p>  <p>  The team in Rathkeale is in ongoing contact with customers about this change and to ensure any individual issues are addressed. Customers will be able to access full banking services at AIB branches in Newcastle West and also in Adare."</p></reply>

Accordingly, such firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA), Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises 2012 and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).  </p>  <p>  For borrowers who are experiencing difficulty with a mortgage which is secured on a primary home, the CCMA requires regulated entities, including credit servicing firms, to have a fair and transparent process for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The mortgage arrears resolution process that is contained in the CCMA sets out the steps a regulated entity must follow in respect of communication with the borrower, gathering of financial information, assessment of the borrower's situation and consideration of resolution options.  In particular, in relation to a 'co-operating borrower', provision 39 of the CCMA provides that, in order to determine options for alternative arrangements for each particular case, a regulated entity must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that entity.  Provision 45 further provides that if a regulated entity does not offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement, for example, where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an alternative repayment arrangement is unlikely to be appropriate, the lender must provide the reasons to the borrower. In these circumstances, the lender must inform the borrower of other options available to the borrower and the implications of each option for the borrower; and his/her mortgage loan account. These options could include mortgage to rent, voluntary surrender, trading down, or voluntary sale. </p>  <p>  Provision 49 of the CCMA also requires that each regulated entity must have an appeals process to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the regulated entity including:</p>  <p>  - where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a regulated entity and the borrower is not willing to enter into the alternative repayment arrangement;</p>  <p>  - where a regulated entity declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to a borrower;</p>  <p>  - where a regulated entity classifies a borrower as 'not co-operating'.</p>  <p>  More generally, a consumer has a right to make a complaint to a regulated financial services provider if they are not satisfied with the service they have received. Should they remain not satisfied with the final response from the regulated financial services provider in question they then have a right to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (&lsquo;FSPO&rsquo;).</p>  <p>  Final decisions on eligibility for the mortgage to rent scheme, however, will rest with the relevant local authority.  </p></reply>

This represents 21% of the total value of the Reserve, the largest allocation for any Member State.  The reference period for expenditure under the Reserve runs from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2023.  </p>  <p>  The objective of the Reserve is to provide support to counter the adverse economic, social, territorial and, where appropriate, environmental consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Importantly, the Reserve may only support measures specifically taken by Member States to contribute to this objective.</p>  <p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the allocation of resources from the Reserve will be aligned with the annual Estimates process.  Ireland has already spent a considerable amount on preparing for Brexit, with successive Budgets since the UK referendum providing significant supports for business and the agri-food sectors, as well as the infrastructure required at the port and airport to maintain the flow of east west trade.</p>  <p>  Possible areas for support under Reserve include enterprise supports; supports for the agri-food sector; fisheries; reskilling and retraining; and infrastructure for the ports and airport.  </p></reply>

The remaining &euro;2.1 billion of the current expenditure increase relates to the provision made for meeting the expected ELS costs across Departments, of which demographics is a component along with the costs of meeting pay agreements, carryover costs of previous year measures and other pressures on demand led schemes. </p>  <p>  A different approach from previous years was adopted in the SES in relation to ELS costs, with the &euro;2.1 billion provision for 2022 based on 3% of the current expenditure base.  In previous years an amount was set aside for demographics in Health, Education, and Social Protection; the cost of pay deals; and the carryover of prior year Budget measures only. The 3% provision is based on budgets in previous years and an assessment of the position in advance of Budget 2022. This is a higher amount than would have been set out as &ldquo;pre-committed&rdquo; expenditure in previous years and provides a better overall reflection of the additional costs required to deliver existing services.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing as Budget 2022 approaches to finalise details on the requirements for meeting ELS costs, including those related to demographics and disability, and allocation of this provision at Departmental and programme level. </p></reply>

While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. Since the easing of restrictions on the 19th of July overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The competition globally to attract tourism will be more challenging than ever. To this end Tourism Ireland have started to &lsquo;roll out the green carpet&rsquo; and welcome back our international visitors as they work to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by &lsquo;pressing the Green Button&rsquo; &ndash; green being the universal colour of &lsquo;go&rsquo; and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. </p>  <p>  Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  One of its recommendations was an increase in the overseas Tourism Marketing Fund to help protect Ireland's existing brand position and kick-start the recovery in inbound tourism. Whilst I am satisfied that Tourism Ireland is sufficiently resourced to roll out its new campaign, I am conscious that we are in a very competitive marketplace at this time. Any additional requirements for the agency will be considered in this context as part of the ongoing budget negotiations. </p></reply>

The North Inner City project involves the regeneration and redevelopment of several areas of the north inner city that have experienced a degree of decline and dereliction over a number of years resulting in poor perception issues and a depiction of an area that the &lsquo;market&rsquo; has forgotten.</p>  <p>  The main objective of this project is to achieve long-term sustainable regeneration around the redevelopment of various areas centred around the Fruit and Vegetable Market, Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square. Complementary projects include Moore Street Public Realm Renewal works with the intention of reactivating one of the most important trading streets in the city along with structural and restoration works to the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street which will facilitate the protection and reuse of these historic buildings as an iconic heritage/visitor attraction (1916 Commemorative Centre) alongside the rejuvenation of the historic street.</p>  <p>  There is a degree of design work yet to be completed with regard to the Moore Street national monument before OPW bring a contractor on-site.  This work is the current priority and it would not be possible at this point to give a timeline for the provision of the accompanying interpretive facility which will facilitate visitors to the national monument. </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in &quot;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&quot;, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

In order for a borrower to qualify for the MTR scheme, the mortgage, property and household must meet detailed eligibility criteria.  In addition, the MTR process has to be carefully implemented with so many parties involved, including the homeowner, the lender, the relevant local authority and the Approved Housing Body or Private Company willing to acquire the property to enable the borrower to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.</p>  <p>  The MTR scheme relies on the lender making the scheme available to the borrower where the lender has deemed the mortgage to be unsustainable and assesses the borrower as being eligible for the MTR scheme.  If a borrower has not been offered an alternative repayment arrangement, or where a borrower is unwilling to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement, and requests the lender to consider them for the MTR scheme and the lender assesses the borrower as being ineligible for the MTR, the lender is required to notify the borrower in writing of the reason(s) for ineligibility in a timely manner.  Should it transpire that MTR is not an option in a particular case, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.  </p>  <p>  It is important also to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank.  The Government introduced the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold retain the same protections which they had prior to the sale.  In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. </p>  <p>  My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and I would encourage borrowers to engage with the Abhaile Service, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, which is available free of charge to the borrower.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: www.mabs.ie/abhaile.  </p>  <p>  For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their long-term housing needs.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. </p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. </p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign  began in September 2019; all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December to take up positions across the brigade in January 2022. A further third recruit class will begin training early in February 2022 with a start date for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s currently under review. </p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a statutory risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. That level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. As this is Fire Safety Week 2021, I remind everybody of the importance of testing their smoke alarms regularly and I commend the kind of community fire safety initiatives aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society, which are undertaken by fire services and are seen a key driver of the welcome downward trends. </p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel  in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of  frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  Unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach agreement on all the issues at this time, some of which are intended to alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. I encourage all parties involved to re-engage and to continue to use the State's established statutory industrial relations machinery to resolve the issues concerned.</p></reply>

The proposed new arrangements will effectively restore decision-making on such large scale housing developments to local authorities in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The proposed new LSRD arrangements will comprise 3 pillars: pre-application consultation stage, planning application stage and appeal stage, summarised as follows - </p>  <p>  - planning authorities will be required to complete the &ldquo;final consultation meeting&rdquo; element of the pre-application consultation stage, involving a bilateral  meeting between the planning authority and the developer, within 8 weeks of the receipt of a request for such meeting;</p>  <p>  - subsequent LSRD planning applications will be generally required to be determined by planning authorities within 8 weeks of receipt of an application;</p>  <p>  - the determination of appeals against planning decisions by planning authorities will be generally required to be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la within 16 weeks of receipt of an appeal. </p>  <p>  The application of these new arrangements is intended to streamline the decision making process for  LSRDs, thereby providing greater certainty and clarity to developers regarding the timelines for decisions in respect of such development proposals. </p>  <p>  Further details in relation to the proposals are set out in the General Scheme which is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/a10f2-general-scheme-of-planning-and-development-amendment-lsrd-bill-2021/.</p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme has already been undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September 2021. The report of the JOC on the General Scheme has just been received this week by my Department and drafting of the Bill is well advanced.  </p>  <p>  Once approved by Government and published, it is intended that the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas and enacted as soon as possible with the new LSRD arrangements commencing on enactment of the Bill. The LSRD and SHD planning consent schemes will both operate concurrently for a limited period of time with developers being able to choose which process to engage with during this interim period. Once the final SHD planning applications have worked their way through the system, the LSRD arrangements will be the sole planning consent system for housing applications of this scale.</p></reply>

My Department does not provide homeless service directly but contributes to overall expenditure incurred by housing authorities in the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding provided by my Department is governed by a Protocol agreement between my Department and the lead authority in each region.  This Protocol sets out the funding arrangements and structures to ensure adherence with statutory requirements and public financial procedures.  The Protocol requires that local authorities and their service delivery partners, including voluntary NGOs and private operators, comply with all statutory codes including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Fire Services Acts and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016.</p>  <p>  In respect of Garda vetting, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 sets out the legal requirement for Garda vetting and the parameters for same.  While many of the NGOs working within the homeless sector have members of staff and volunteers that are vetted under the Act, homeless services are not currently specifically identified in the relevant legislation whereby vetting is mandatory.  My Department is actively engaging with the Garda National Vetting Bureau and the Department of Justice in this regard with the objective of ensuring that where it is needed, Garda vetting is made available under the Act.</p>  <p>  All homeless accommodation that is provided by local authorities and funded by my Department, are required to comply with standards.  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services. The NQSF specifically provides that service users are safeguarded and protected from abuse and their safety and welfare is promoted where services are provided.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has recently reframed the quality assurance arrangements under the NQSF to cover all privately operated facilities and these are currently being rolled out.</p></reply>

This allowed the RTB to move to an entirely self-financing position in 2010. However, due to a deterioration in the RTB&rsquo;s finances as a result of reduced registrations, a growing demand for RTB services and new functions under amendments made to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, it became necessary to obtain direct Exchequer funding since 2016.</p><p>The total Exchequer allocation of current funding made available to the RTB for operational costs 2016 &ndash; 2021 is outlined in the table below.  </p><p><b>Allocated Exchequer Funds to RTB</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Amount </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;351,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;1,350,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;4,390,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;7,010,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;9,000,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;11,000,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department does not collect the breakdown of the data sought, however the Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.

Section 94 of the Electoral Act 1992, as amended by section 3 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996, provides that Returning Officers must, where practicable, select buildings for polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users. </p>  <p>   A Working Group on Disability Voting was established by my Department in December 2018 to examine and make recommendations on issues that arise under a range of areas, including improving accessibility to polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, with the goal of all polling stations being fully accessible as soon as possible. Returning Officers continue to work to reduce the number of inaccessible polling buildings and polling stations. The progress being made will continue to be monitored by the Working Group.</p>  <p>  Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts provide for a range of measures to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities, including:</p>  <p>  - The requirement on local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be accessible to wheelchair users;</p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given  to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps;</p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement;</p>  <p>  - The requirement on Returning Officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users. </p>  <p>  If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. </p>  <p>   While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-06a.156.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100600070#WRD02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 54 together.</p>  <p>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE. </p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. </p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign  began in September 2019; all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December to take up positions across the brigade in January 2022. A further third recruit class will begin training early in February 2022 with a start date for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s currently under review. </p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a statutory risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. That level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. As this is Fire Safety Week 2021, I remind everybody of the importance of testing their smoke alarms regularly and I commend the kind of community fire safety initiatives aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society, which are undertaken by fire services and are seen a key driver of the welcome downward trends. </p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel  in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of  frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  Unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach agreement on all the issues at this time, some of which are intended to alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. I encourage all parties involved to re-engage and to continue to use the State's established statutory industrial relations machinery to resolve the issues concerned. </p></reply>

During his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit this year, the Taoiseach raised the matter directly with President Biden. I also raised immigration issues in my meetings on Capitol Hill during my most recent visit to Washington, DC. These engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum in the US, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. I look forward to working with his Administration as well as with the US Congress, on a bipartisan basis, as they pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. We will actively engage with the Administration and Congress on this matter, including through our Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Government continues to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US.</p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, my Department works closely with Irish immigration centres, which support the needs of Irish citizens. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. Last year, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2020, over &euro;4.25m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for ESP and Covid-19 related projects.</p></reply>

My Department does not have any employer/employee relationship with the teachers or other staff in an ETB and it cannot perform functions which are proper to the employer in relation to the management of such employees.  It is a matter for the parties involved to address such matters having regard to relevant procedures or policies in place including any grievance or complaints processes relevant to the issues concerned.  </p>  <p>  In the case of a complaint about a member of teaching staff in a school, any complaint should be addressed, in the first instance, to the ETB as employer.  In addition, the Teaching Council of Ireland has a complaints facility that can be accessed in appropriate cases, details are available on their website at www.teachingcouncil.ie/ </p>  <p>  In relation to protected disclosures, under section 21(1) of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, all public bodies, including Education and Training Boards (ETBs), are required to establish and maintain procedures for the making of protected disclosures by their employees. Where an ETB receives a protected disclosure, they are required to follow those procedures. </p>  <p>  Any follow up actions in relation to a protected disclosure made to an ETB are a matter for the ETB concerned. Depending on the nature of the disclosure, the ETB may need to deal with the matter in accordance with other relevant internal procedures and/or refer the matter to an external investigative or regulatory authority where appropriate. In handling a disclosure, ETBs must also adhere to their obligations under the Act to maintain the confidentiality of the employee concerned.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has issued guidance to assist public bodies, including in the performance of their functions under the Act. The guidance includes that the procedures should allow for a system for review in respect of the outcome of an assessment/investigation undertaken in respect of the protected disclosure or of any complaint of penalisation. </p>  <p>  Both of the ETBs referred to by the Deputy have confirmed that they have a protected disclosure policy in place.  While ETBs are obliged to protect the confidentiality of persons making a disclosure and therefore are constrained in terms of commenting on particular disclosures or actions arising from same, all ETBs are required to report on the number of protected disclosures received in their annual reports. The ETBs in question have published this information in their annual reports and separately as a standalone document and both are available on their respective websites.  </p></reply>

A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  </p>  <p>  The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.   While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  </p>  <p>  Last month, I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to provide an update on a number of issues including the measures that are being taken to prevent and tackle bullying in schools. </p>  <p>  During my appearance at the Joint Committee, I announced that my Department will commence a review of its 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools.  </p>  <p>  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying and identity based bullying, including gender identity and racist bullying</p>  <p>  This work will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students.</p>  <p>  I also announced that during this school year, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. </p>  <p>  As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work will be a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary level. SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives.  This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. </p>  <p>  As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. </p></reply>

As the deputy is aware, my Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. </p><p>The curriculum plays an important role in teaching students about managing their wellbeing. The Curriculum Framework for Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) was developed by NCCA in consultation with teachers, learners, parents, management bodies and others.</p><p>The framework builds on students&rsquo; prior learning in primary and junior cycle SPHE.  The aim of senior cycle SPHE is to support learners in making choices for health and wellbeing now and in the future. </p><p>The curriculum framework for SPHE in senior cycle is an enabling curriculum.  The framework is built around five areas of learning one of which relates to Mental Health.  </p><p>The objectives of the mental health area of learning are to: </p><p>1. develop students&rsquo; confidence and competence to act in support of mental health and wellbeing</p><p>2. develop students&rsquo; self-awareness about the attitudes, values and beliefs that underpin healthy personal lifestyle behaviours and choices </p><p>3. develop students&rsquo; capacity to empathise with others through a greater understanding of different life experiences, motives and feelings of other individuals and groups</p><p>4. examine the factors which impact on mental health and wellbeing and develop young people&rsquo;s ability to act on behalf of personal and group health and wellbeing</p><p>The management authority of each school carries responsibility for making decisions regarding the Transition Year Programme in that school.</p><p>Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests.</p><p>The NCCA has undertaken an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways, including Transition Year, the Leaving Certificate Applied, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Established.</p><p>A key theme of this review was the future form and reform of the existing senior cycle programmes. This includes the range of learning programmes and pathways available to students at senior cycle, with a desire expressed that senior cycle should provide adequate supports for whatever progression pathways are chosen by students. My Department is currently considering this and other aspects of the NCCA&rsquo;s advisory report, which will be published shortly.</p><p>Regular monitoring and external evaluation of Transition Year programmes is provided by the Department's inspectorate and psychological service.

Under the special educational needs model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritized on their individual needs. </p>  <p>  Parents/guardians should engage with the Principal of their child&rsquo;s school or the school&rsquo;s SEN co-ordinator to discuss their child&rsquo;s needs and to consider requesting a consultation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p>  <p>  A NEPS assessment is not required for the pupil concerned to access learning supports. In September 2017 a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools was introduced.  The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs. This model differs from the previous system whereby pupils were allocated a prescribed number of resource teaching hours on the basis of a named disability. The new model gives schools the capacity to respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. </p></reply>

A sub-group of the main Expert Group focussed exclusively on the issue of improving and monitoring ventilation in schools.  A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>This report formed the based for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation and the use of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors.</p><p>My Department arranged for the provision of a number of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors based on the approximate size of each school.  The use of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation. The portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools including ASD classrooms.</p><p>Deliveries of CO<sub>2  </sub>monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors being distributed to primary and post-primary schools with an estimated cost of &euro;4 million.  Over 28,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors have been distributed to schools to date, meaning that CO<sub>2  </sub>monitors have been delivered to each school in the country. The monitors are portable, simple to use, and will give a digital reading. </p><p>96% of primary schools (including all special schools) have received their full allocation of CO<sub>2  </sub>monitors.  Ten CO<sub>2</sub>monitors have been provided to schools at post-primary level with the balance of their allocation to be distributed this month. </p><p>My Department arranged for the provision of a number of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors based on the approximate size of each school.  The mechanism for determining the approximate size of the primary school was the number of mainstream classrooms in the school.  </p><p>The number of CO<sub>2 </sub>monitors provided to each school was then determined using the following bands: <table>    <tr>       <th>Primary Schools (Classrooms)</th>       <th>Monitors per school</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Primary Schools (Classrooms)</td>       <td>Monitors per school</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 classroom</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 to 4 Classrooms</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 to 8</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9 to 12</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13 to 16 </td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 20</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21 to 24</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25 to 30</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31+</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>Monitors per school</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary Schools   (Free Scheme) enrolment bands</td>       <td>Monitors per school</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;500</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>501 to 750</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>751 to 1000</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1001+</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. CO<sub>2</sub>measurements are a less reliable measure of ventilation performance in single or low occupancy spaces or in very large spaces (SAGE UK, 2020, AIVC, 2021). </p><p>Where an individual schools identifies an additional need, the Department has put in place a mechanism in place for schools to request additional monitors through a dedicated helpline and email account. </p><p>The Department has received a small number of such requests to date, which will be considered and processed after the completion of the distribution of  35,000 monitors referred to above.</p></reply>

Where these reviews resulted in an increase in the pensioner&rsquo;s rate of payment, the increase was backdated to 30 March 2018 or the pensioners 66th birthday, as appropriate.  As at the end of October 2019, with the project completed, 94,258 reviews had been finalised; of these, 53,092 (56%) were women and 41,166 (44%) were men.  Of the 53,092 women reviewed 28,528 (54%) received an increase while the rest remained on their existing rate.  Of the 41,166 men reviewed, 9,956 (24%) received an increase and the remainder continued to receive their same rate of payment.  No pensioner had their pension payment reduced as part of this review. </p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided prior to 1 September 2012 were not affected by the Budget 2012 rate band changes.  As a consequence, people whose pensions were calculated under the 2000-2012 rate bands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year could attract a 98% pension.  </p>  <p>  There will be some people who have contributed less frequently into the Social Insurance Fund (which pays for contributory pensions), and who will, therefore, be below the threshold required for a maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State Pension (Contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;237 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of similar employment services across.</p>  <p>  This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  The Phase two procurement, which will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State will take on board the learnings of the first phase. This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  The timeline for commencement of the new Regional Employment Services under Phase two was originally January 2022. This has now been postponed to the end of June 2022, giving potential tenderers additional time to prepare collaborative joint bids. </p>  <p>  My Department is therefore in the process of offering current Local Employment Service and Job Club providers, in the Phase two areas, a new contract for a short period into next year. This will enable continuity of service to our customers, while providing potential tenders additional time to work collaboratively on submitting joint bids.  The Requests for Tenders for Phase two will issue prior to the end of this year and my Department has written to relevant service providers outlining the revised timelines. </p>  <p>  The reasons for proceeding with this procurement of employment services are two-fold. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the existing LES contracts are no longer consistent with current best practices. The new model entails moving to multi-annual contracts with enhanced key performance indicators and a funding model that allows more autonomy on how best to deliver enhanced services and greater visibility of the performance of all service providers. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the Department is in receipt of legal advice from the Attorney General's office that it must procure its employment services in an open and competitive manner in order to meet its legal obligations arising from EU and national procurement rules.</p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns of the sector at the changes to the existing model. However, current service providers with a strong track record and a willingness to cooperate with others in the sector will be well-placed to submit high-quality tenders for the new services. </p>  <p>  The new model and its associated procurement process is accessible to the community and voluntary sectors given the model's significant emphasis on service quality and the need to harness local networks and linkages to best support the clients of the new employment service. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 1,007,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community. In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit. </p>  <p>  While a person in receipt of Invalidity Pension may satisfy the qualifying payment criteria for a free travel pass s/he must also satisfy the residency criteria. An applicant must be legally resident and living permanently in the State (i.e. on an all-year-round basis). Therefore, a person in receipt of Invalidity Pension who resides in Northern Ireland will not qualify for a free travel pass from this State.  Entitlement to a travel pass in Northern Ireland is dependent on the rules there.</p>  <p>  The all-Ireland Free Travel Scheme for seniors resident in all parts of the island was introduced in April 2007.  The scheme enables seniors (over 66) resident in the Republic to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, seniors (over 65) in the North can travel free of charge on bus, rail, air and ferry services participating in the Free Travel scheme in this State. </p>  <p>  Any extension to the scheme would have to be agreed with the Northern Ireland authorities and would require additional funding to be put in place.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement.</p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commence the 2015 Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform that it represents.  We are working towards a date of June 2022 for commencement of the 2015 Act and establishment of the Decision Support Service immediately thereafter.  An inter-departmental steering group is meeting regularly to prepare for commencement of the Act.</p>  <p>  Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which will address a number of issues required to streamline processes and improve safeguards for those who will rely on the provisions of the Act.  I expect to be in a position to publish a Bill by year-end, and to see it enacted next year.</p></reply>

The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.</p>  <p>   The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on/week-off and zero hour contracts.  Moreover, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for up to 45 hours per week is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children. </p>  <p>  The NCS attempts to strike the right balance between enabling access to early learning and childcare services given the benefits this confers to children, and, supporting parents to engage in work or study, given the impact this has on alleviating poverty.</p>  <p>   Notwithstanding this, my Department and I are committed to monitoring and reviewing the operation of the NCS. My Department has procured independent researchers to undertake a 12 Month Review of the NCS. </p>  <p>   My Department will be considering the findings from the research reports with a view to ensuring the NCS meets its policy objectives, of improved children's outcomes, parental engagement in work or study and reduced child poverty, and support those most in need. The review will consider usage by socio-economically disadvantaged families and providers serving socio-economically disadvantaged communities. The reviewing body will also consider international evidence of the efficacy of the work-study rule.</p>  <p>  I will consider any changes as may be required on foot of the evidence derived from this review.</p>  <p>  Additionally, I have convened an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the sector. As part of this, the Expert Group will make recommendations for additional supports for learning and childcare settings that operate in the context of concentrated disadvantage in order to mitigate the impact of disadvantage on children.</p></reply>

It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.</p>  <p>  Prior to September 2018 there were three entry points to ECCE.  This lead to a situation where there was variation in the number of ECCE weeks a child could qualify for, ranging from between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child. The introduction of a single entry point a aligned to the start of the primary school year ensured that all children could receive 2 full years of ECCE, or 76 weeks. This also ensures that all children can experience the full pre-school curriculum.</p>  <p>  A single entry point has also streamlined the administration process for providers, making it easier for them to operate and budget for the programme year. In addition it has made it easier parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p></reply>

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in ETB Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. </p>  <p>  Phase 2 electrical apprenticeship provision is delivered across all 16 ETBs. Phase 2 apprentices commence off-the-job training throughout the year with apprentices called to the next available training place, regardless as to the home location of the apprentice.  Whilst every effort is made to eliminate unnecessary travel, unfortunately for some apprentices it is impossible to avoid having to attend training facilities that are not convenient to their locality. All apprentices are advised at their mandatory induction briefings of the training process.</p>  <p>  Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course.  At the end of August 2021, there were 3,000 electrical apprentices waiting for access to phase 2 off-the-job training.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support apprentices progress their off-the-job training in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Specific actions relating to the provision of Phase 2 off-the-job training are as follows:-</p>  <p>   - Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.   </p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This has facilitated an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.  </p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.</p>  <p>  The additional investment in supports, as well as training providers re-commencing in September at full capacity will mean that by the end of December 2021 over one third of the phase 2 apprentices will have returned to training. The waiting list for Phase 2 apprentices is expected to be completely cleared by the end of 2022.  It is not possible at this point to provide information on scheduling dates for individual apprentices as work is ongoing to maximise the level of provision across the country.</p>  <p>  A public update issued on www.apprenticeship.ie on 23rd September which outlined the comprehensive programme of work underway and to ensure that information is available to apprentices, employers and prospective apprentices.  SOLAS will release further updates as the work to ensure that apprentices can complete their apprenticeships in a timely manner progresses.  The apprentice in question should also maintain contact with their Authorised Officer. </p></reply>

Prisoner transfers are, at present, operated under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995, which implements the 1983 Council of Europe convention. The framework decision supersedes the convention in respect of transfers within the EU and makes several important changes to how transfers operate. </p>  <p>  As a consequence of Brexit, the framework decision does not apply to transfers to and from the United Kingdom, which will continue to be governed by the convention and the 1995 Act. However, as the Deputy will be aware, transfers under the 1995 Act have been subject to legal challenge in recent years. Differences in sentencing structures between states have proved difficult and often impossible to reconcile. This has precluded the completion of many transfers, particularly between Ireland and the UK. While the issues that have arisen are addressed for the new regime in the Bill before the House, the 1995 Act will also require amendment. It is my intention to introduce the necessary amendments to that legislation by way of Committee Stage amendments to this Bill.</p>  <p>   It is my aim for this Bill to be enacted by the end of 2021. </p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.</p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.  </p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p><p>Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. </p><p>Mobilisation of the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery is expected to commence in November. The pilot will deliver an additional 230,000 hours of home-support in four community healthcare network (CHN) sites over a six-month period. The pilot sites are: (CHO 2) Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea (CHO 4) Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline (CHO 7) Ballyfermot and Palmerstown (CHO 8) East Westmeath. </p><p>130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs and recruitment for these posts is scheduled to commence in this quarter. In addition, a National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year. </p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services. </p><p>In relation to home support service provision, data which has been provided since the cyber-attack is provisional and subject to change - at the end of August 2021, the preliminary data indicates that about 13.2 million home support hours had been provided to 53,905 people. This is about 2 million more hours compared to the same period last year.</p></reply>

It has been developed under the HSE Finance Reform Programme &ndash; a significant transformation programme for the health sector in terms of scale and complexity. The financial reform programme is well advanced with much work done across the HSE at a tactical level to align existing, processes and upgrade legacy regional financial systems where this is possible. IFMS will provide better reporting, management, governance, compliance and transparency, and a better overall financial control environment, commensurate with the scale and complexity of the HSE and the funding provided for  health services in Ireland. IFMS will also provide a single standardised financial and procurement system to voluntary organisations will, for the first time, provide quality standardised financial and procurement information across both statutory and voluntary services.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of the work done to date, a detailed design for configuration of the SAP systems underpinning IFMS was completed in July of this year. The next phase of the programme is the build, configuration and test phase. This will be followed by a phased rollout of over a 4 year period.

In this context, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly on the question of any planned expansion of dementia specific daycare services in Co.Mayo. </p>  <p>  I received a pre-budget submission from the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland on September 9th 2021 which the Department and I have considered ahead of Budget 2022. As Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, I regularly engage with representative groups including Western Alzheimer&rsquo;s and the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland. I have met with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland along with Department of Health officials to discuss their pre-budget submission. I am committed to supporting the continued development of dementia services, including the expansion of day centres.</p>  <p>  I am also committed to the implementation of the Irish National Dementia Strategy, which works towards improving how we provide care for people living with dementia across the country. As the Deputy may be aware, in Budget 2021, the Government allocated &euro;12.9 million for a number of dementia specific measures. This allocation comprised of &euro;7m for an additional 250,000 hours of home support for people living with dementia, &euro;0.9m to expand the dementia advisor service operated by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and &euro;5m for implementation of the National Dementia Strategy.   </p>  <p>  One of the measures funded through the &euro;5m for the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy is the development of four new Memory Assessment and Support Services in Mayo, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford. These new services will improve access to assessment and diagnostic services.</p>  <p>More broadly, the provision of funding to respond to the ongoing need for dementia specific services is a matter for consideration in the forthcoming Estimates process.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre-cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of August 2021 there were 4,511 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 5,528 in August 2019.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to develop a two-pronged approach to tackle the rise in waiting lists.  Firstly, with the finalisation of a Waiting List Action Plan which will cover the rest of the year, until December 2021. Secondly through the development of a longer-term Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the of persons waiting on an ophthalmology appointment for less than six and more than six months by county, is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;Ophthalmology by County&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p></reply>

The aim of the policy is to develop a model of care that will enable preventative approaches to be prioritised, improve access, and support interventions appropriate to current and future oral health needs.</p>  <p>  The current DTSS is based on outdated approaches from the 1990s and is no longer suitable. I am committed to ensuring the sustainability of the DTSS, but recognise that it needs to be aligned  with the best international evidence and practice, as outlined in the new Policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the roll-out of the National Oral Health Policy to be delayed, and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. Officials in my Department and from the HSE are currently engaging with the Irish Dental Association on matters relating to the provision of services under the DTSS.</p></reply>

However, the Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with plans for further increases in future years.</p>  <p>The additional funding will put general practice on a much more sustainable footing and will help make general practice more rewarding and a more attractive career option for doctors. Overall, these measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.   </p></reply>

In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy was published, as well as the HSE&rsquo;s National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. The National Maternity Strategy recognises the importance of improving and standardising bereavement care throughout our maternity services and recommends the implementation of the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. The Standards are designed to enhance bereavement care services for parents who experience a pregnancy loss or perinatal death and cover all pregnancy loss situations from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death. </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress to implement the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death. This includes the development of Specialist Bereavement Teams in all 19 maternity hospitals/units, each with a Clinical Midwife Specialist in Bereavement, and the majority of maternity units also now have a specific Bereavement Room.  This ensures that families who have experienced a bereavement, get high standard, compassionate care in an appropriate setting, and a setting that affords them privacy and dignity at a very difficult and distressing time. There are also quiet rooms available in most units to facilitate parents spending time with their baby. The Department has been assured that all units continue to implement the Standards, and this is closely monitored by the Bereavement Standard Implementation Steering Group which reports to the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.</p></reply>
