My Department is currently working on a new Roadmap for Social Inclusion which includes concrete commitments, policies and strategies in to reduce child poverty.  The Roadmap will include targets designed to address poverty and social exclusion including specific targets in relation to child poverty.  I expect to bring the Roadmap to Government for approval in the near future and to publish it prior to the summer recess.</p>  <p>  The existing National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, called Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, includes a target to reduce, by two-thirds, the number of children in consistent poverty from its 2011 level of 106,000 to no more than 37,000 by 2020. Given the impact of the deep recession this target is extremely challenging.  In fact the number of children recorded as being in consistent poverty increased to just over 148,000 during 2013. </p>  <p>  The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions, or SILC, show a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children, which decreased from 10.9% to 8.8%, a reduction of just over 2 percentage points, the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004. In terms of numbers, there were on average 105,000 children in consistent poverty during 2017 - a reduction of  30% on its peak level in 2013; so contrary to the proposition set out in the question  the number of children in poverty is falling, not as much as we would like or as fast as we would like but still we are making progress.  We have yet to receive the up to date data for 2018 and 2019, however, if this rate of reduction continues (and given the continued recovery in our economic fortunes, we expect that it has) we should get close to the national target by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  We will be helped in meeting that target by changes I made to child related welfare payments over the past two budgets the impact of which have yet to be reflected in the SILC data.  These include the first increases for many years in payments for child dependents, the introduction of a new higher rate of payment in respect of children over 12 and increases in income thresholds and disregards for the Working Family payment and the One Parent Family payment. I have also provided increased funding for free school meals and launched a new Hot School Meals pilot programme this year.  In making these changes I have, together with other colleagues who have, for example, extended free GP and affordable child care services, specifically targeted the issue of child poverty and we expect that these changes will bear fruit.</p>  <p>  The new Roadmap for Social Inclusion takes a whole-of government approach, and will collect in one place the range of policy measures across government Departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion. This Roadmap sets out our ambition to significantly reduce poverty levels and identifies a specific set of commitments to help deliver on this ambition for different groups, including children. It also identifies the Departments repsonsbile for delivering on these commitments and the timeline for delivery of these commitments.  In this way I, as Minister, intend to hold all of Government agencies and Departments to account for ensuring that we become the most socially inclusive State in the EU.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-30a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019053000045#WRA01500"><p>Farm assist is a means-tested income support scheme for farmers.  The annual Farm Assist review form is designed to ensure that the correct level of payment is made to the customer, taking into account any changes in circumstances that may have occurred in the past year.</p>  <p>  The means test for Farm Assist takes account of all income sources with certain disregards applicable to specific income sources.  Different rules apply to income from farming and other forms of self-employment.  Income from certain schemes such as Direct Payments, income from employment and income from property and capital are taken into account.  An examination of farm outgoings is also included in the assessment process.</p>  <p>  Farm Assist was audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 and one of the recommendations from that audit was to enhance the annual declaration review form. The annual review process for Farm Assist has been comprehensively changed to incorporate several elements of means which had not previously been sought and examined during the annual review stage. This revised annual declaration process requires all recipients to make a return to the Department with supporting documentation as to income and expenditure over the preceding year.  In line with the recommendation of the C and AG the review form now encompasses 4 pages of information that the customer is requested to provide to my Department. Because the scheme is means tested, these questions focus on possible changes in farm income as well earnings of the partner, if any. </p>  <p>  In addition, the form also makes provision for the customer to set out in some detail changes in their outgoings related to the farm expenses. This was introduced in 2016, following discussions with the Farm Representative Bodies who considered that customers should be able to outline the impact of these expenses from year to year.</p>  <p>  Given that the form now complies with recommendations from the C and AG and takes account of suggestions made by the Farm Representative Bodies there is limited scope for any further revision. However if the Deputy has specific suggestions he would like to make my Department will be pleased to receive these suggestions and will consider if they can be implemented.</p></reply>

The most up to date  data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions was released by CSO in mid-December 2018.  This data was examined and is being incorporated into the draft document which is now the subject of consultations with other departments.  The outline approach which was developed following a prolonged consultation process was also discussed at the Social Inclusion Forum hosted by my Department last week and feedback from that forum will also be incorporated into the final draft.</p>  <p>  With regard to the SILC data, this shows that the consistent poverty rate has decreased to 6.7% in 2017, from a high of 9% in 2013 and from 8.2% in 2016.  The percentage of the population experiencing deprivation also significantly decreased, falling to 18.8% from a high of over 30% in 2013 and 21% in 2016.  These figures, which do not include the full-year impact of budget changes in 2017 nor any impact from the 2018 and 2019 changes, demonstrate that the Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling poverty through the provision of income supports, access to quality services and supports for people in taking up employment is working.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that the Roadmap will be published at the earliest opportunity, most likely during June.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-30a.106.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019053000047#WRC00700"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  The Deputy will be aware that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have the power to direct insurers on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework (the Solvency II Directive) for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurers to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurers and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurers on a case-by-case basis, including with regard to community events, whether large or small, that may be organised.</p>  <p>  In light of the above, I would be cautious about the introduction of a publicly funded insurance scheme that would provide insurance cover to such events in this jurisdiction.  There is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing this risk than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially could be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.</p>  <p>  In addition, any such insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of that insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.  Also, while it may appear that such a scheme might alleviate problems in the short term, the introduction of such a scheme could ultimately decrease competition in the Irish insurance market over the longer term, as some insurers may stop insuring particular risks completely if there is a view that the State/local authorities are insuring these risks instead, particularly those lines of business that are considered to be unprofitable.  This could mean there would be even less of a choice for those seeking cover which could result in  the cost of insurance becoming even more expensive than it is now.  Such outcomes would be of detriment to consumers, community groups, voluntary organisations or businesses.</p>  <p>  In view of these issues, I am not convinced therefore that a State/local authority-backed insurance scheme, whether it be to insure community events or other risks, would be a solution to the current problem regarding the cost or availability of insurance for such events and initiatives.  Instead, I think that we need to continue to implement the recommendations of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG).  Indeed, the reforms already introduced by the CIWG&rsquo;s work are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak) and I am determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant in this case.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this progress, it is widely recognised and accepted that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses, or event organisers, is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In that regard, the Personal Injuries Commission, which was established under a recommendation of the CIWG, has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.</p>  <p>  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. The Judicial Council Bill has recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad and the Government has approved the drafting of amendments for Report Stage in the Seanad, which will provide for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee whose sole purpose will be to develop such guidelines which will fall to be adopted by the Judicial Council.  With the cooperation of all members of the Oireachtas, it is hoped that the Bill can be enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition, arising from another recommendation of the CIWG, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.  It is hoped that if there was a significant move in this area, it could have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the market.  Such outcomes would be of benefit to all concerned.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for the citizens of this State and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

The programme of work will be undertaken under the auspices of the OECD over the coming months, on a without prejudice basis.  I understand that this work programme is due to be published by the OECD at the end of May. </p>  <p>  The programme is structured under two broad pillars, known as Pillar one and Pillar two. In very broad terms, Pillar one is examining where profits of multinationals are allocated and examining mechanisms for potentially amending existing approaches. Pillar two is to examining the concept of minimum effective taxation. </p>  <p>  The work on both Pillars is at a very early stage and the OECD work programme provides a framework for technical work to begin in the OECD's technical working parties.  The discussions on both Pillars are not yet formulated as draft proposals which can be fully analysed by countries at this stage.  </p>  <p>  The proposals on the table under Pillar one are, as yet, quite diverse and there is no clarity on what might ultimately be agreed. While clearly a change in how profits are taxed in different jurisdictions would result in a shift in profits being allocated from one location to another, upward and downward adjustments won&rsquo;t become clear until technical work advances.</p>  <p>  As regards Pillar two, the work programme will detail some of the potential mechanics of how a minimum taxation proposal may operate but there is not sufficient detail at this stage to estimate the impact of any eventual proposal on corporation tax receipts. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, it is not possible to calculate the impact on corporation tax receipts of implementing the proposals as they are currently drafted. Officials in my Department and Revenue will be actively engaged in the work at OECD, including the estimation of the impact of the options as they emerge in more detail.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 23 May, I delivered a speech on this important topic at the Harvard Kennedy School and Irish Tax Institute Global Tax Policy Conference where I signalled that change is coming in the international tax rules as a result of the work now underway at the OECD to find a globally agreed solution to the challenges in relation to the taxation of an increasingly digitalised international economy. </p>  <p>  In that speech, I outlined my belief that it might be possible to find a globally acceptable agreement within the broad Pillar 1 proposals that provides certainty. I also set out the principles that would need to be observed in order for the OECD process to result in an agreed outcome. Those principles include aligning taxing rights with value creation, respecting the long established international corporate tax framework as well as the primary taxing rights of exporting countries and not disproportionately benefiting large countries at the expense of smaller ones. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined, a minimum effective tax proposal had not, until recently, been part of the discussions at the OECD on addressing the tax challenges of digitalisation and I remain to be convinced of the validity and appropriateness of this aspect of the work.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, Ireland is positively engaged in the discussions at OECD and I remain open to solutions which respect our right to compete fairly and which respect the legitimacy of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate.

I am advised by the TAC that it is difficult to provide an actual quantum figure because the original quantum of tax under appeal may be modified post filing of the notice of appeal (i.e. where an aspect of the appeal is settled or withdrawn), the parties may disagree in relation to the precise quantum of tax in dispute, or the monetary value of an appeal is not always calculable (e.g. in appeals where the rate of tax is in dispute or where the quantum in dispute represents a refusal of loss relief or of deductions or in appeals in relation to the refusal of Tax Clearance Certificates).  Subject to these caveats, as at 20 May, 2019 the TAC recorded the quantum of tax under appeal amounting to approximately &euro;3.7 billion. Of this amount, &euro;2.5 billion is comprised in 10 appeals, five of which were received by the TAC in the last week of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Some appeals before the TAC cannot be progressed when the Commission has to await the outcome of court proceedings.  For example, a stay may have been placed on the progression of the appeals by the TAC by Order of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. Of the 10 highest-value appeals before the TAC, two appeals with a combined value of &euro;1.67 billion are currently stayed by Court Order and cannot be progressed by the TAC until the stays are lifted.</p>  <p>  In view of the growing backlog of appeals, I commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the TAC in 2018.  In line with the review's recommendations, I sanctioned the doubling of the TAC&rsquo;s annual budget in 2019, to allow for additional staffing resources at all levels and additional funding for improved ICT systems. In June 2018 the TAC moved to a new, larger premises that allow for the scheduling of simultaneous hearings, to ensure greater and more efficient use of Commissioner&rsquo;s time. This is resulting in a reduction in the time parties have to wait for their appeal to be heard. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Public Appointments Service competition for the recruitment of Temporary Appeal Commissioners was completed recently and details of appointments from the resulting panel will be announced shortly. Legislation is also in progress to create the role of Chairperson of the TAC, as per a recommendation of the independent review.</p>  <p>  With the substantial increase in resources at the TAC, I expect the overall number of appeals on hand, and consequently the quantum of tax under appeal before the TAC, to begin to decrease steadily over the coming year.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p><p>Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p><p>The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.</p><p>Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the <i>www.gov.ie</i>website and in the Oireachtas Library online catalogue.</p><p>Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision, pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.</p><p>The contract terms for the interim cohort will, therefore, continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66 as previously provided for.</p></reply>

Under that Framework students can take between 8 and a maximum of 10 subjects for final examination and for reporting through the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA). The maximum of 10 subjects was designed to provide a broad curriculum experience to students, while allowing for the adequate depth of study of the subject matter, as well as avoiding stress to students as a result of taking a higher number of subjects (Students taking the old CPSE exam, being examined for the last time in 2019, are permitted to take 11 subjects this year).</p>  <p>  Changes to the curriculum and polices that affect students are not made lightly. The Framework was published following a complete review of the earlier junior cycle programme, involving consultation with a wide range of education stakeholders including students.  The changes to the number of subjects a student should study were notified to schools in 2014 when schools were advised to begin limiting the overall number of subjects they offer to students for certification and that a limit of ten subjects for certification will be in place for students entering first year in September 2015. This advice has been repeated in advice issued to schools in the years since 2014, including Circular 0015/2017 (superseded by 0079/2018). It was also included in an information leaflet produced for parents of post-primary students. 2018 was the first year in which Junior Certificate students were required to sit no more than 10 subjects under Circular 0015/2017. </p>  <p>  The majority of schools promptly followed the instruction issued by this Department and advised students of the maximum number of subjects permitted. Students would in a number of cases have reduced the number of subjects they were taking.</p>  <p>  The student is at the heart of the policy set out in the Framework for Junior Cycle. The Framework embodies a number of features designed to provide a learning experience that addresses the needs of the 21st century. It presents a curriculum designed for all students, not just for some.  Under the Framework students study subjects in greater depth.  Students are more likely to retain the knowledge as they have opportunities to apply their learning in a number of different contexts, engage in research, investigation and experimentation and present their work in a variety of different modes. They are encouraged to think critically and reflect on and evaluate their own learning, either as individuals or in collaboration with their peers. The Framework supports the move away from rote learning and instead is designed to help the students to become better learners, and better citizens.  This is done through embedding key skills for successful learning across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. More relevant learning like this leads to deeper learning and achievement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-30a.159.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019053000048#WRD00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian or student who has reached the age of 18 years to the Secretary General of my  Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. </p>  <p>  The most recently available statistics on Section 29 appeals are from the calendar year 2018. In 2018, my Department received a total of 432 Section 29 appeals. Of these, 256 went to a full oral hearing before an independent Section 29 Appeals Committee. Of the appeals heard by an independent Section 29 Appeals Committee, 113 (44%) were upheld.  My Department does not provide information on section 29 appeals in relation to individual schools. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 is providing for a new Section 29 to be put in place to replace the existing Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  Section 7 of the Education (Admissions to School) Act 2018, when commenced, will provide for a number of significant changes to the appeals process under section 29 of the Education Act. The main aim of these changes being put in place is to make the process fit for purpose and less cumbersome for parents and schools. Many of the changes relate to operational matters and seek to align the legislation with actual practice and procedures as they have developed over the years and increase the efficiency of the processes. However, there are also a number of changes which relate to policy matters.  These include the following matters: </p>  <p>  - setting in statute that the cumulative number of days on suspension that has to elapse before an appeal can be lodged at 20 days;  </p>  <p>  - removing the additional layer of appeal currently provided in section 29 which requires that appeals in relation to ETB schools must be heard in the first instance by the ETB;</p>  <p>  - clarifying that an appeal against a decision to suspend, expel or refuse to admit where the decision to refuse admission is not due to oversubscription, is an appeal &lsquo;de novo&rsquo;, which encompasses a full re-hearing of the matter by an appeals committee, based on the evidence and materials properly available to the committee; </p>  <p>   - providing that an appeal against a decision to refuse to admit where the decision to refuse admission is due to oversubscription is an appeal on the record, where the evidence and materials which are properly relied on by the appeals committee will be the same as those which were before the school;</p>  <p>   - providing that procedures for appeals shall be determined by the Minister, including the timeframes for appeals;  </p>  <p>   - providing for an appeals committee to issue a preliminary decision, following an oral hearing ( i.e. in the case of appeals against a decision to suspend, expel or refuse to admit where the decision to refuse admission is not due to oversubscription). The applicant and board can provide observations on the preliminary decision and following consideration of any observations received, an appeals committee will make a final decision to confirm or amend the preliminary decision; </p>  <p>   - providing that in the case of a decision to refuse admission which is due to a school being oversubscribed, an applicant must request a board of management to review the decision before an appeal can proceed and where an error or failure has been identified the Board must correct that error or failure.  However, in the case of a decision to refuse admission which is not due to a school being oversubscribed, the applicant may request, but is not required to request, a review by the Board prior to proceeding to an oral hearing. This provides a fast track for appeals against a decision to refuse enrolment where a school has places available but for some reason is refusing to offer a place contrary to one of the most fundamental provisions of the Admissions Bill; </p>  <p>   - introducing a compellability that where an appeal is allowed the school must admit the student, readmit the student or adjust the ranking of the student on the waiting list as applicable; </p>  <p>  The new section 29 provisions are designed to operate within the broader admissions framework being put in place under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. In that regard, I have outlined that it is my intention to commence the relevant provisions of the Act, including those relating to the new section 29, so that they will apply to applications for admission in respect of the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

If concluded, an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date. The most recent formal round of negotiations took place in Buenos Aires on 11<sup>th</sup>&ndash; 15<sup>th</sup>March 2019. A week of intersessional meetings also took place between the European Commission and Mercosur in Buenos Aires between 13<sup>th</sup>&ndash; 17<sup>th</sup>May 2019.</p><p>At the October 2017 round of talks, an offer was made to Mercosur of an annual quota of 70,000 tons of beef to secure an FTA. This offer was divided into 35,000 tons of fresh beef and 35,000 tons of frozen meat. During discussions in January 2018, the Mercosur region made it clear that an increased offer on beef would be required to conclude the Agreement. However, the European Commission - which leads on such trade negotiations for the Member States under the EU Treaties - has not formally tabled a revised EU market access offer to date, as it awaits further movement from Mercosur on the EU&rsquo;s offensive interests.  In this regard, Ireland and other Member States remain clear that the EU&rsquo;s offensive goals must be achieved in the negotiations, particularly for Ireland&rsquo;s dairy industry, before any final discussions on beef quota arrangements take place.</p><p>Overall, Ireland remains committed to these negotiations, especially in the view of the important economic and political gains expected for both sides from a comprehensive, ambitious, and balanced EU-Mercosur Agreement. Sectoral opportunities for Ireland in further enhancing a trading relationship with this region include software and services in telecommunications, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, food and beverages, and education services.</p><p>Negotiations are ongoing with the likelihood of an agreement dependent on a number of factors, including whether there is an additional EU offer on beef.  Ireland continues to engage with our colleagues in the Commission and other Member States on the matter and they are aware of Ireland&rsquo;s trade sensitivities in relation to agricultural products (especially beef), and the cumulative impacts for the agriculture sector across the suite of FTAs.  Ireland&rsquo;s view on any Agreement reached, will be informed on the aggregate benefits the Agreement offers our economy as a whole.</p><p>In relation to the EU Trade Council meeting on Monday 27<sup>th</sup>May, the substantive agenda items were discussions on WTO Reform, EU-US trade relations, and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade and Investment Protection Agreements. The Commission also gave a debrief over lunchtime on ongoing Free Trade Agreements, including Mercosur.  Ireland expressed our commitment to the negotiations with Mercosur, but also expressed our concerns in relation to agriculture &ndash; in particular, sensitive tariff lines in relation to beef and Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) volume. The Commission confirmed that they are keenly aware of Ireland&rsquo;s national sensitivities on agriculture in the context of this and other FTA negotiations.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE. I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The disease has spread to a number of EU Member States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Belgium) as well as to countries in Asia. The disease does not affect other animal species or humans and there are no food safety implications.</p><p>ASF has never been detected in Ireland. The introduction of ASF into Ireland would have very serious implications for the pig industry here. For this reason, it is important that everyone plays their part in keeping these disease out of Ireland. The most likely routes of introduction would be through the import of infected live pigs (including wild boar) or pig products from affected countries. </p><p>Members of the public should not bring in pigmeat products from affected countries and should ensure that all food waste is disposed in a way that animals cannot get access to it. Keepers of pigs are reminded that they must be registered with my Department. Keepers of pigs, including those with only one or two pigs, are reminded that the feeding of food waste containing meat and meat products is strictly prohibited. </p><p>To protect their animals and their businesses, all keepers of pigs should implement strict biosecurity measures including tight controls on who has access to their pigs.  Under the current Rural Development Programme (2013-2020), funding is available to all commercial pig farmers, through the Targeted Advisory Service for Animal Health (TASAH) mechanism, to have a comprehensive and objective &lsquo;Biocheck.UGent&rsquo; biosecurity review carried out on their farms by a trained private veterinary practitioner. This service is <i>free of charge</i>to pig farmers.  Animal Health Ireland (AHI) delivers the TASAH funded biosecurity reviews on behalf of my Department.  To avail of the Biocheck review, farmers should contact their private veterinary practitioner or Animal Health Ireland. </p><p>As part of measures aimed at minimising the risk of the introduction of exotic diseases such as ASF into Ireland, my Department has been involved in a range of activities including monitoring the international disease situation, working with international partners and monitoring the movement of pigs into Ireland via the EU TRACES online platform. Keepers of pigs are reminded that the import of wild boar into Ireland is prohibited. </p><p>My Department has engaged in an intensive communications programme aimed at highlighting the risk of ASF entering Ireland to all stakeholders. Disease factsheets are available for both vets and farmers, and a letter was circulated to all registered pig keepers as part of the annual pig census. Posters have been placed in airports and on ferries warning people travelling abroad about the risk of bringing home meat products. Tailored biosecurity information including a multilingual poster has been produced for farmers and farm personnel. The Department circulated specific advice regarding ASF for international general hauliers in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Tailored biosecurity leaflets have been produced for international livestock hauliers and hunters who may travel to ASF affected countries.  An awareness campaign reminding all that the feeding of food waste containing meat products to pigs is prohibited is now being launched. Checks are carried out by both Revenue and the Department at ports and airports using a risk based approach. Manual checks along with a trained Customs dog and scanning equipment is used at Dublin airport to detect food in luggage. </p><p>Specific EU legislation (Directive 2002/60/EC) is in place that sets out the control measures to be implemented in the event of an ASF outbreak in an EU member state in order to control the disease and prevent any spread. These control measures include, for example, culling of animals in affected herds, animal and animal product movement restrictions, investigation into the source of disease and surveillance of susceptible populations.  These control measures are being implemented in the affected countries and my Department stands ready to implement such measures in the event ASF were to be introduced into Ireland.</p></reply>

The Department had previously carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, to establish the potential volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This exercise has been used to guide relevant planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required.</p>  <p>  Regarding staffing requirements in the run up to potential Brexit deadlines in March and April, my Department sought to use a combination of recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. My Department worked with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service to engage Veterinary Inspectors, Portal Inspectors, Plant Health Inspectors and Administrative support staff. Mechanisms to temporarily redeploy experienced people within my Department were also initiated and the engagement of contracted temporary service arrangements was also progressed to address contingencies.</p>  <p>  My Department has up to 230 staff resources available for deployment across a range of disciplines in both front line control and back up administrative spheres.</p>  <p>  Overall, I remain confident that my Department is in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p><p>I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p><p>The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is really welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. </p><p>The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges. </p><p>Details of the proposal are being discussed with the Commission and I will make information available to farmers as soon as possible. The legal provisions used to provide the aid (Council Regulation 1308/2013) were put in place by the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013. It is expected that this decision will be given effect through an Implementing Regulation. My officials will examine its provisions, when published, and engage with the Commission on the next steps.</p><p>Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

Ireland's position in relation to these negotiations is well-known, and has not changed. We have consistently opposed any agreement that would have negative consequences for the Irish and EU agriculture sectors, and for the beef sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Under these negotiations, the EU made an offer to Mercosur of a beef Tariff Rate Quota of 70,000 tonnes in October 2017.  Ireland objected strenuously to this development, consistent with the approach which it has taken for many years, and we have continued to work closely with other Member States, and with the European Commission, to ensure that no further concessions are made by the EU in relation to beef market access.   </p>  <p>  As regards recent developments in these talks, an intersessional round of discussions took place in Buenos Aires in the week beginning 13 May 2019, but no date has yet been set for the next formal round of negotiations.   </p>  <p>  In an overall sense, there is undoubtedly a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations.  I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  I also continue to stress that full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.</p></reply>

Ministers structured their interventions around questions posed by the Presidency in relation to annual reporting. </p>  <p>  A number of Member States expressed misgivings on annual milestones and preferred either biennial milestones or the possibility to set milestones only in the middle and at the end of the implementation period.  In principle, Ireland can accept a requirement for annual reporting providing it is not unduly burdensome from an administrative point of view but has reservations in relation to some of the detail relating to measuring outputs. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the CAP post-2020 are continuing and there is still much to be decided upon before agreement can be achieved.  Ireland remains ready to work closely with the Presidency, Commission and the Member States to achieve the best outcome.</p></reply>

On each of the occasions that the ban has been extended, it has been done through statutory instrument made by my predecessors under powers conferred by the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated they would legally challenge the decision of two former Ministers to extend the ban nationwide. As I have previously indicated, the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019/20 heating season. I also do not propose to extend the smoky coal ban to other individual towns in the meantime. </p>  <p>  I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. </p>  <p>  I am aware that Wexford County Council recently passed a motion to introduce a countywide ban the sale and use of smoky fuels. It is a matter for the Council to decide how they wish to proceed in this matter.</p></reply>

Home charging is the most cost-effective way to charge an electric vehicle and is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 78 fast chargers as a part of the ESB eCars network. A map showing these charge points, including their status and availability, is available on the ESB's website at www.esb.ie/ecars. In addition there are public chargers provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. </p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is also working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations.

The Minister will hold one special share in National Broadband Ireland; the special share does not count as equity share capital. </p>  <p>  The NBP Contract contains a suite of measures in relation to changes in ownership and control. For example, NBI is obliged to notify the Minister of any Change in Ownership that is restricted by the NBP Contract throughout the life of the Contract and there are provisions in the Contract in relation to clawback payments in the event of a sale of NBI prior to year 10 of the contract. If a Change in Ownership occurs, NBI (in new ownership) will continue to be bound by the NBP Contract. </p>  <p>  NBI is obliged to seek the written consent of the Minister prior to the occurrence of a Change in Ownership of NBI that occurs at any time from the commencement of the contract up until one year after the completion of deployment. After the one year anniversary of the completion of deployment, the shares of NBI can (subject to certain exceptions) be sold without Ministerial consent but not to Unsuitable Third Parties. Unsuitable Third Parties include excluded parties specifically set out in EU procurement regulations, parties materially involved in the arms trade, parties who have been convicted of a criminal offence related to business, parties who have materially failed to comply with tax rules and parties whose activities pose a threat to national security.</p>  <p>  The NBP Contract requires that the Minister&rsquo;s consent is obtained for a Change of Control in respect of a Shareholder (i.e. Granahan McCourt Dublin (Ireland) Ltd) in National Broadband Ireland at any time until 12 months after the Deployment Completion Date. The Minister cannot unreasonably withhold his consent in this regard.</p>  <p>  Also, if any shareholder has a contingent commitment to make a loan or equity or capital contribution to NBI, NBI is required, until that commitment has been delivered, to seek the written consent of the Minister to a Change in Ownership which results in the shareholder ceasing to have Control of NBI.</p></reply>

I am currently considering the recommendations in the light of the ongoing changes being implemented by Tusla in terms of their workforce and social work practice.  It is important to note that a person has been convicted in this case, and was sentenced in April last year.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my sincere acknowledgement of the pain and distress suffered by the three women at the centre of this report. </p>  <p>  The period in question relates primarily to 2003 to 2011, when the child protection and welfare services were part of the HSE. However. these services are now with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which was established in 2014.  By way of context the report notes that the decisions in the case were made in good faith and that the social work department were very committed to the children in their care.  It presents a clear analysis of the failures that occurred in managing the case. </p>  <p>  The HR and performance management functions were, at the time, within the structures of the HSE.  I have been advised that the Child Care Manager at the time did not have line management of the staff involved, and staff supervision policy and caseload weighting was not as developed as it is now.  Currently, Tusla's processes for managing staff include the following: all staff working with Tusla are required to practice in line with agreed policies and procedures; a management team is in place to actively manage individual and team performance; staff are supervised in line with the guidance set out in Tusla&rsquo;s Supervision Policy; and, since 2011, all social workers are registered with CORU which regulates the profession.</p>  <p>  The report published on 28 May last includes four recommendations for Tusla.  In summary the recommendations refer to a) reviewing the role of the link social worker; b) developing a service the brings the relevant agencies together to minimise the re-traumatisation of re-interviewing and this recommendation appears to refer to the One House/Barnahus model which will be  piloted in Galway this year; c) greater co-operation between agencies in managing complex cases which may take the form of a steering/management style group, in particular with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE; and d) the inclusion of child sexual abuse risk assessment and knowledge/skills as a core element of the Signs of Safety approach. The Report acknowledges that the findings may have been addressed through existing reforms.   </p>  <p>  The detail of the recommendations need consideration but much of the work needed to address the findings is addressed in the five year Child Protection and Welfare Strategy launched in 2017. I am determined that the reforms underway and the roll out of the Child Protection and Welfare Strategy will be completed to ensure that the risks of this happening again are being fully mitigated.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package.  Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Carer's payments are made at a higher level than other working age income-maintenance payments made by my Department.  The weekly rate for Carer's Allowance is &euro;219 where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where it is two or more, compared to &euro;203 for most other income-maintenance payments to those below pension age.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is also significantly more generous than those applying to other schemes.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over 50 years of working age life.  </p>  <p>  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions.  A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension. </p>  <p>  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension after pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working life. Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  In general, social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process. One such example is the carer's allowance (CA) scheme.</p>  <p>  To qualify for CA, the carer must show that they are habitually resident in the State, that they are providing full-time care and attention to a person who requires this level of care and that their means are less than the statutory limit.</p>  <p>  It is also the case that in order to register their claim and establish an early entitlement or claim date many people submit a claim without first securing all of the necessary supporting documentation.  While this does ensure that people will be paid with arrears from an early "effective" date it does mean that claims take longer to process.</p>  <p>  The claim processing is kept under active review, with all possible steps taken to improve processing times.  This includes the temporary assignment of additional resources and the review of business processes, to ensure the efficient processing of applications.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Additional staff have also been allocated to the office in recent weeks.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.  The figures for the first four months of 2019 show some improvement with 27.9 weeks taken to process an oral hearing and 23.6 weeks taken to process a summary decision.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I am advised by my Department that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p>  <p>  Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.   </p>  <p>  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Payments are not suspended unless there is a valid reason for doing so, for example the provision of insufficient information by the customer in response to a query, or where there is no reply from the customer.

Ensuring that persons who have been overpaid make an on-going contribution to the recovery of their debts is a key element of this work.  </p>  <p>  Overpayments of social welfare assistance and benefit payments arise as a consequence of decisions made under the relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended). Where an overpayment is raised, the Department is obligated to make every effort to recover sums overpaid.  </p>  <p>  As part of the process of decision-making and assessing an overpayment, the Department is required and is willing to engage with the customer to agree a suitable rate of repayment.  In each case, the customer must be given an opportunity to clarify any relevant matters. </p>  <p>  Overpayments may be recovered through regular periodic payments, deduction from the customer's on-going benefit payments or by way of a single payment covering the full amount owed.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Act 2012 introduced a provision that allows the Department, in the absence of engagement by the debtor, to apply a deduction of up to 15% of the weekly personal rate of assistance or benefit payable to a customer for the purposes of  recovering a debt. The deduction applies to the person&rsquo;s personal rate only and does not affect payment of any adult or child dependent allowances, or any other allowances that are in payment.</p>  <p>  Customer may, at any time, also seek to review the terms of any recovery arrangement(s) they have in place with the Department.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-30a.428.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019053000052#WRH04500"><p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold. The policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs have created an environment in which business can succeed and has led to the creation of more than  400,000 jobs in Ireland since the economic low point of 2012. Secondly, through the <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy, my Department ensures that as many new jobs as possible are filled by people taken from the live register, particularly the young unemployed. </p><p>To date these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment. Recently released data from the CSO, Labour Force Survey shows that youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 10.9% in the first quarter of 2019 and now lies below the EU average of 15%.  Additionally, the number of young people in employment has increased by 25% since 2012, with 262,600 young people in work in the first quarter of 2019.  </p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a personal progression plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training.</p><p>For those who do not find employment through this process, additional offers are provided for through further education and training programmes or in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment service that provides additional resources and case managed supports to those long-term unemployed.  </p><p>In October 2018, I introduced a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long term unemployed or who face significant barriers to employment. The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) provides young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic and social skills in a supportive work-based environment.  Participants received a payment of &euro;229.50 per week.  My Department is aiming to place up 1,000 young jobseekers in the scheme this year.</p><p>My Department continues to reviews its activation programmes and policies to make sure that they remain aligned to labour market requirements.  Given the progress made during the lifecycle of <i>Pathways to Work</i><i>2016-2020 </i>and the improved nature of the labour market, my Department has begun preparations to develop an activation framework for a time of economic prosperity. The new framework aims to support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements in the labour market that have been seen over the last few years.</p><p>Over the coming years, we must make sure that our citizens are equipped with the skills to take up jobs of the future and avail of the opportunities arising from a modern economy.  <i>Future Jobs Ireland 2019 </i>has been launched by Government replacing the <i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>to deliver the required policy reforms to build a resilient workforce and innovative and competitive economy in a changing world of work. The strategy includes a number of youth specific measures which will be delivered on a whole of Government basis.</p></reply>

A Part 4 tenancy may be terminated by a landlord or tenant, without reason, at the end of its term.</p><p>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 extended the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years, for tenancies commencing on or after 24 December 2016; this delivered on a commitment, in Action 8 of the Government's 2016 <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, to provide for 6-year tenancies as part of a transition to tenancies of indefinite duration. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 enhances further the security of tenure for tenants by significantly extending the duration of tenancy termination notice periods; for example, a minimum of 180 days (approx. 6 months) notice must be provided by landlords who terminate a tenancy of between 3 and 7 years&rsquo; duration. In addition, further measures have been introduced to enhance and enforce tenancy termination provisions, including:</p><p>- the application of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)'s new investigation and sanctioning regime to improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions; and</p><p>- a new requirement for landlords to copy a tenancy termination notice to the RTB.</p><p>The transition to tenancies of indefinite duration is being considered in the context of a further Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill which I will be bringing forward later this year and is expected to be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in Q4 2019.
